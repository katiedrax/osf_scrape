constitutional transgressions shape public attitudes and how these attitudes are mitigated or altered by the political arguments that the ruling ANC party regularly makes. My overarching hypothesis is that citizens in South Africa, including ANC supporters, object to constitutional transgressions, but that the ANC\u2019s political arguments are effective in preventing these objections from significantly undermining ANC support. As a result, important political events that erode institutional procedures prescribed in the constitution, most pertinently the Arms Deal and aftermath, can occur without significant political damage for the ANC. This dynamic is dangerous for a new democracy, because institutional erosion, once set in motion, is difficult to reverse. It is therefore important to understand better the role that public accountability plays on procedural issues at the constitutional level. Research Design: Respondents will receive one of three \u201cconstitutional treatments\u201d (C1, C2, C3) and one of three \u201cpolitical treatments\u201d (P1, P2, P3) that are real events based on the South African \u201cArms Deal\u201d (a set of military purchases that involved high level bribes and then years of institutional oversight battles) that were reported in the news. Respondents will simply be told that these events were reported in the news \u2013 there will be some questions afterward about if they were familiar with the scenarios and if they believed they were accurate as well as questions to test their knowledge of the events and understanding of the experimental manipulation. Real events are used to maximize external validity. Combining the two types of treatments, there are a total of 9 randomly assigned treatment groups: P1 P2 P3 C1 1. C1P1 4. C1P2 7. C1P3 C2 2. C2P1 5. C2P2 8. C2P3 C3 3. C3P1 6. C3P2 9. C3P3 Further, all treatment groups will then be asked if they perceived a constitutional violation and then get a \u201cpersuasion treatment\u201d (C4) that asks them to reconsider under the assumption that the Constitutional Court of South Africa (CCSA) ruled otherwise to see if this has any effect on their evaluations of ANC actions. The dependent variable is support for the ANC \u201cwhen it acts this way\u201d measured by degree of approval (strong or weak) and how people feel about the party on a temperature scale. My primary analysis will be conducted using OLS, adjusting for pretreatment covariates for race, ANC support (measured in a randomized list of parties), home language, age, and class. For simplicity, in stating my tests below I refer to the OLS measure of the treatment effect as the \u201cdifference\u201d between treatments. The sample will be roughly N=1200-1600 from between 10 and 20 sites around Johannesburg. While this is far from a nationally representative sample, it should be high in ANC supporters, which is of primary concern, and include variation in both socio-economic class and how people identify (race, ethnicity, or nationally) which are explanatory variables for two secondary hypotheses with a reasonable expectation of sufficient power. Respondents will be selected by going house to house and in public spaces (to ensure variation) using randomized selection patterns. Constitutional Treatments: C1 describes a decision from the Arms Deal and indicates that corruption may have been involved. It is intended to capture the idea of corruption from the Arms Deal without any procedural transgressions of the event. C2 includes the statement from C1 and then adds a description of implicit constitutional transgression. Based on theoretical arguments developed elsewhere in the dissertation, the action is a transgression because it undermines the meaning of institutional authorities conferred by the constitution by signaling that the ruling party is not subject to those authorities. However, C2 does not say that the action was against the constitution, so it is implicit. C3 includes statements C1 and C2 but then says that the action violated the constitution, hence it is an explicit transgression. C1, C2 and C3 are all statements that summarize what has been stated in various news reports; while they are put in simple terms, there is no deception involved. Political Treatments: P1 is a control with no political treatment. P2 and P3 are drawn from political arguments that Jacob Zuma made in his Freedom Day speech in April 2013. They include one statement of fact and one persuasive statement by the ANC. The first one (P2) is the most common ANC political argument, emphasizing economic improvement and leadership of the liberation struggle. The second one (P3) is the ANC\u2019s common response to accusations of corruption or transgression.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"Hypotheses: H1: Citizens are less likely to approve of ANC actions and will feel \u201ccolder/less favorable\u201d about the ANC as a result of considering information about a constitutional transgression (i.e constitutional transgression marginally significant in the absence of political arguments).

honesty, and integrity\u2014is an important determinant of the quality of government. But how do we attract high quality citizens to run for public office? How do we nudge good politicians? A dominant paradigm in the modern political economy literature builds on the idea that incentives matter. Incentives such as high wage or prestige of being in office attract a pool of high quality candidates. The problem, however, is that incentives that attract good politicians also work to attract bad ones. In a world with perfect information where good types can be distinguished from bad types, the policymaker can simply target incentives to good types to nudge them to run for office. Unfortunately, we are in a world where bad politicians pretend to be good types. In other words, the policymaker is confronted with the problem of adverse selection. Without any mechanism that can screen-in good citizens and selectively nudge them to run for public office, incentives would be implemented inefficiently. A Theory of Screening In this research study, I evaluate a policy intervention in which good politicians can be screened-in, and hence be selectively incentivized to run for office. The idea is very much in the spirit of the game theoretic model of schooling as a screening device. I propose a mechanism\u2014instead of schooling, a workshop\u2014in which aspiring politicians will be given an incentive, but conditional on performing well in the workshop (i.e. conditional on being able to signal that they are \"\"high quality\"\" candidates). Using randomized field experiment, I show that this mechanism can selectively nudge high quality citizens to run for office. In short, I propose to evaluate a policy intervention that systematically nudges good politicians. The Experimental Design The design of the field experiment is as follows. Before a scheduled election, call for applications will be sent out to citizens who are contemplating on running for an elective office. The call for application is for an all-expense-paid workshop that would equip participants with knowledge and leadership skills useful in campaigning and in policymaking. There will be limited slots and so interested participants will be informed that selection is not guaranteed but that everybody will have an equal chance of being selected. There will be a pre-workshop session in which selected applicants will be asked to take a baseline survey and undergo a series of tests. The tests, in particular, will measure \"\"quality\"\" such as aptitude (measured by a test of memory for digit span), personality trait (measured by Big Five Inventory), motivational profile (measured by Perry's 1996 scale of Public Service Motivation), and aspiration (measured by Kasser and Ryan's 1993 aspiration index). Additionally, I will measure the ratio of the length of the index and ring fingers (also called the \"\"digit ratio\"\") as proxy for biologically determined factors of altruism and pro-social behavior. After the pre-workshop session, respondents will then be randomly assigned into three experimental groups: a Control Group (A), a Workshop with Conditional Incentive Treatment Group (B), and a Workshop with Unconditional Incentive Treatment Group (C). Participants in the Control Group (A) will not be invited to the workshop and will not receive any further intervention. They will act as the counterfactual, the \"\"business-as-usual\"\" group. Those assigned to the treatment groups B and C, on the other hand, will be invited to attend a workshop. However, none of them will be informed of any incentives at the time of the invitation, to prevent differential take-up across these two treatment arms. In the workshop, participants will attend different sessions in which their output and performance will be monitored and scored. If the screening theory is correct, then \"\"high quality\"\" participants (e.g. those who have high aptitude, more altruistic, have high public service motivation, etc.) should be delivering quality outputs and performing better than their counterparts. If a participant is assigned in Treatment Group B (workshop with conditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive at the end of the workshop only if he/she makes the pre-determined cutoff score. On the other hand, if he/she is assigned in Treatment Group C (workshop with unconditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive regardless of his/her score. The incentive is a combo of two things: (1) a certificate of merit to be awarded during the closing ceremony of the workshop, and, (2) should the incentive recipients decide to subsequently run for an elective office, the sponsoring partner organization shall donate 5 pieces of campaign posters to them. In other words, the incentive is designed to lower the cost of campaigning (since the recipient will receive 5 pieces of free campaign posters), and to increase the psychic benefit of running for office (for example, because the recipient may view it as a fruit of their hard work during the workshop.). Outcomes of Interest The main outcomes of interest are: (1) subjects' subsequent decision to run or not run for office, (2) conditional on filing an official certificate of candidacy, their vote-share margin of victory, (3) a binary variable for winning the elective seat, and (4) conditional on winning an elective seat, subsequent performance in office measured in several ways including session attendance, legislations passed, projects delivered, funds raised, among others. Nudging Good Politicians: The Composition of Those Who Run for Office, Those Who Win, and Those Who Perform in Office I am interested in measuring the effect of the treatments on the composition of those who choose to run for office, those who win, and those who perform while in office. If the screening theory is correct, I only expect treatment group B to work in selectively nudging high quality citizens to run for office, win office, and perform well in office, where quality is measured by their baseline characteristics (i.e. memory for digit span, public sector motivation, digit ratio, aspiration, and personality). Because the incentive in treatment group B is only given conditional on making the workshop performance scores cutoff, and because \u2018high quality\u2019 respondents are more likely to make the cutoff (given that effort is less costly to them), then the mechanism works to selectively incentivize high quality citizens. In effect, this causes better outcomes on average in this group relative to the other experimental groups, A and C. Practical Considerations A foremost practical concern of my research project is how to identify the population of interest \u2013 these aspiring political candidates. It is virtually impossible to find a group of political amateurs who would be willing to participate in a large-n experimental study in which some of them are randomly assigned into being exposed to a workshop described above. I look to a particular and germane political setting to implement this proposed field experiment - my country, the Philippines. The Philippines is by far the only country in the world that popularly elects youth representatives to its smallest political unit\u2014the barangay (village). Each of the 42,000+ barangays in the country is mandated by law (under the Local Government Code of 1991) to establish a Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), a governing body comprised of youth aged 15 to 17 years old. Crucially for my proposed research project, the SK is a low-stakes public office (both in terms of remuneration and in scope of responsibilities) and it often serves as a jump-off point for a political career for aspiring politicians. Therefore, their group offers an apt opportunity to implement my proposed policy intervention. In anticipation of the upcoming Barangay level elections in October 28, 2013, I plan to implement my proposed field experiment beginning August 1, 2013. Theoretical Innovation Incentives can be inefficient because of adverse selection. Designing a mechanism in which incentives are given conditional on being able to signal type can be Pareto-improving. The theoretical innovation is in applying the logic of screening to the task of incentivizing high quality citizens into running for public office. Empirical Contributions This paper is a first attempt to provide experimental measure of incentive effect in the literature on political elite behavior and selection. It is also a first attempt to systematically show that workshop/training acts as a screening device outside of private sector labor markets. Additionally, it is a first attempt to correlate objective measures of quality with political selection in an experimental setting, and a first attempt to provide systematic experimental evidence that confirms/debunks what we know about political selection, i.e., bad types have the comparative advantage into entering politics.

There is room for private and nonprofit organizations to design programs that can screen-in good politicians and raise the quality of the political class at the onset of their careers.

But how do we attract high quality citizens to run for public office? How do we nudge good politicians? A dominant paradigm in the modern political economy literature builds on the idea that incentives matter. Incentives such as high wage or prestige of being in office attract a pool of high quality candidates. The problem, however, is that incentives that attract good politicians also work to attract bad ones. In a world with perfect information where good types can be distinguished from bad types, the policymaker can simply target incentives to good types to nudge them to run for office. Unfortunately, we are in a world where bad politicians pretend to be good types. In other words, the policymaker is confronted with the problem of adverse selection. Without any mechanism that can screen-in good citizens and selectively nudge them to run for public office, incentives would be implemented inefficiently. A Theory of Screening In this research study, I evaluate a policy intervention in which good politicians can be screened-in, and hence be selectively incentivized to run for office. The idea is very much in the spirit of the game theoretic model of schooling as a screening device. I propose a mechanism\u2014instead of schooling, a workshop\u2014in which aspiring politicians will be given an incentive, but conditional on performing well in the workshop (i.e. conditional on being able to signal that they are \"\"high quality\"\" candidates). Using randomized field experiment, I show that this mechanism can selectively nudge high quality citizens to run for office. In short, I propose to evaluate a policy intervention that systematically nudges good politicians. The Experimental Design The design of the field experiment is as follows. Before a scheduled election, call for applications will be sent out to citizens who are contemplating on running for an elective office. The call for application is for an all-expense-paid workshop that would equip participants with knowledge and leadership skills useful in campaigning and in policymaking. There will be limited slots and so interested participants will be informed that selection is not guaranteed but that everybody will have an equal chance of being selected. There will be a pre-workshop session in which selected applicants will be asked to take a baseline survey and undergo a series of tests. The tests, in particular, will measure \"\"quality\"\" such as aptitude (measured by a test of memory for digit span), personality trait (measured by Big Five Inventory), motivational profile (measured by Perry's 1996 scale of Public Service Motivation), and aspiration (measured by Kasser and Ryan's 1993 aspiration index). Additionally, I will measure the ratio of the length of the index and ring fingers (also called the \"\"digit ratio\"\") as proxy for biologically determined factors of altruism and pro-social behavior. After the pre-workshop session, respondents will then be randomly assigned into three experimental groups: a Control Group (A), a Workshop with Conditional Incentive Treatment Group (B), and a Workshop with Unconditional Incentive Treatment Group (C). Participants in the Control Group (A) will not be invited to the workshop and will not receive any further intervention. They will act as the counterfactual, the \"\"business-as-usual\"\" group. Those assigned to the treatment groups B and C, on the other hand, will be invited to attend a workshop. However, none of them will be informed of any incentives at the time of the invitation, to prevent differential take-up across these two treatment arms. In the workshop, participants will attend different sessions in which their output and performance will be monitored and scored. If the screening theory is correct, then \"\"high quality\"\" participants (e.g. those who have high aptitude, more altruistic, have high public service motivation, etc.) should be delivering quality outputs and performing better than their counterparts. If a participant is assigned in Treatment Group B (workshop with conditional incentive), then he/she will receive an incentive at the end of the workshop only if he/she makes the pre-determined cutoff score.

"value": "\"Overview: This study looks at the effects of yard signs on support for a ban on fracking in California. Approximately 1,500 individuals in California ordered signs opposing fracking from a California political group. Half of these individuals were randomized to a treatment group that received the signs on Wednesday, November 20, 2013 while the remaining half will not receive the signs until the second week of December. Data on residents of the 40 closest households to each of the 1,500 sign orderers were obtained from TargetSmart Communications and an automated script was used to identify which of these households would likely be exposed to the signs if they were placed in the proximate yard. Phone interviews with these households subjects began on Saturday, November 30. This document was prepared prior to the completion of the first day of surveying, before any data was examined. Subjects: Subjects are registered voters living in California near a person who had ordered a yard sign. A group first supplied us with the addresses of 1,500 people who had ordered yard signs opposing fracking. A Python script relying on the Google Maps API identified the route each of the 40 closest households would take to drive to their city center from their house and retained households in the sample if this route took them within 120 feet of the center of the proximate house that ordered the sign. Assignment: We first clustered signs together that were within \u00bd a mile of each other to form clusters of signs (to limit spillover). We then blocked clusters together into blocks of size 2 using BlockTools, blocking on the sign's latitude and longitude. Random assignment was conducted within these blocks using R's sample() function. Outcome measurement: The calling house that conducted the survey attempted to secure one survey response per household that we had ex ante identified as likely to see the signs (see above). Analysis Outcomes: We plan to recode the survey responses in the following way. Support for a ban on fracking. 7 - Strongly support 6 - Not so strongly support 5 - Lean towards favoring 4 - No opinion 3 - Lean towards opposing 2 - Not so strongly oppose 1 - Strongly oppose Importance of fracking as an issue 1-5 scale \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d response recoded as 1, not at all important Perception of neighborhood support for ban on fracking 5 - Almost everyone 4 - Most 3 - Some 2 - A few 1 - Almost no one Record \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d as 1 Yard sign recall 2- Yes 1- Not sure / Don\u2019t know 0- No Estimation: For preliminary results we will use the difference-in-means estimator with standard errors generated by randomization inference. For the final article we will employ an estimator not sensitive to relationships between cluster size and potential outcomes using cluster totals. Covariates: The voter file contains variables that we expect to be prognostic of outcomes: party registration, gender, and age. Party affiliation will be measured with a survey question for individuals who cannot be conclusively identified. In addition to presenting results without covariates, we will include these as covariates in order dampen sampling variability. Party registration and gender will be coded as indicator variables. Age, age-squared, and an indicator for missing data will be used as regressors. Subgroup effects: We plan to test for the following two heterogenous treatment effects: The treatment effect of the sign will be larger for households that live closer to the sign. The treatment effect of the sign will be larger for people who have voted in more previous elections (proxy for political information levels). The treatment effect of the sign will be larger in regions of California where average yard sign issue importance is higher.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "(This field was made required after this registration was initially submitted.)"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "see above"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Descriptive Norms and Issue Support: A Field Experiment with Yard Signs", "q2": "Donald Green | David Broockman", "q3": "20131130AA", "q4": "11/30/2013 - 15:29", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "", "q9": "", "q10": "", "q11": "", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "", "q15": "\"Overview: This study looks at the effects of yard signs on support for a ban on fracking in California.
