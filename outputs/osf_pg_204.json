Psychophysiological markers, specifically reactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), has received much interest as a non-invasive, low-cost indicator of autonomic flexibility, the ability to flexibly adapt to changing contextual demands.(Laborde, Mosley, &amp; Thayer, 2017; Kok &amp; Fredrickson, 2010). As a lack of autonomic flexibility has been shown to be an important contributing factor to depression (e.g., Kashdan &amp; Rottenberg, 2010), it is important to understand the specific underlying mechanisms between ANS reactivity and depression. \nDespite the theoretical support for the autonomic nervous system (ANS) playing a role in the development and manifestation of depressive symptoms, empirical support has been mixed. Specifically, it is unclear when ANS profiles confer risk, or relate to psychological outcomes at all(see Stange, Alloy, &amp; Fresco, 2017 for a review). Such mixed findings may reflect (a) limitations in how we operationalize an adaptive ANS response or (b) that individual differences moderate the relation between ANS responses and emotional distress. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test how ANS responses across systems (i.e., parasympathetic and sympathetic) and contexts (i.e., stress and reward) may interact with interpersonal well-being to forecast distinct patterns of depression risk. \nTo date, studies have predominately investigated reactivity in the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and to a lesser extent, activity in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to understand ANS reactivity (Bylsma et al., 2015). However, there is growing evidence that investigating the effects of the PNS and the SNS simultaneously, as opposed to exclusively focusing on one index or the other, provides a more sensitive and comprehensive understanding of the effects of the ANS (Bernston et al., 2008). Following this notion, it may be more promising to utilize composite measures of the ANS to understand its effects on depressive symptoms. In recent years, cardiac autonomic balance (CAB) reactivity, designed to identify biases in the ANS (i.e., sympathetic or parasympathetic responses) and cardia autonomic regulation (CAR) which reflects the level of reactivity more broadly (i.e., high or low reactivity) have been proposed as more comprehensive indices of emotional distress, as opposed to examining markers of the PNS and SNS in isolation (Byslma et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2020). \nIn addition to predominately relying on sole measures of the ANS, studies regarding ANS reactivity and depressive symptoms have primarily only examined ANS reactivity under stressful contexts (e.g., Gentzler et al., 2009). However, congruent with a RDoC and developmental psychopathology perspective (Franklin, Jamieson, Glenn, &amp; Nock, 2015), research increasingly suggests the importance of investigating multiple pathways that may lead to psychological distress. For depression, reactivity to reward, in addition to reactivity to stress, may be necessary for a comprehensive understanding of depression risk (Pizzagalli, 2014; Luyten &amp; Fonagy, 2018). Importantly, past research investigating comprised measures of ANS reactivity found different reactivity profiles under stressful and rewarding tasks, in that CAB reactivity was found to be reflective of adaptive responsiveness to stress, whereas CAR reactivity was associated with greater engagement response to stimuli during a reward task (Bylsma et al., 2015; Kreibig et al., 2012). Therefore, examining ANS responses under both a stress task and a reward task may help elucidate the relationship between ANS reactivity and depression. \nFinally, it is important to note that most research on the ANS have investigated the main effects of the ANS without consideration of possible moderating variables. Contemporary transaction models emphasize that vulnerabilities and risk factors operate at multiple levels of analysis and suggest the importance of considering interactions across different levels to confer psychopathological outcomes (e.g., Beauchaine &amp; Gatzke-Kopp, 2012). Of interest, the polyvagal theory proposes that the ANS may be highly interrelated with an individual\u2019s responses to environmental cues, as the same brain circuits involved in regulating vagal activity play an important role in an individual\u2019s engagement with their social environment, including eye gazing, hearing the human voice, and making appropriate facial and head gestures (Porges, 2007). These findings may suggest that behavioral consequences stemming from ANS profiles (e.g., depressive symptoms) may be highly dependent on how responsive one\u2019s environment is. Thus, it may be most promising to examine how social processes may moderate the relationship between ANS reactivity and depressive symptoms.\nA wealth of research has demonstrated the importance of social support, and the protective role it plays against depression in youth (see Lakey &amp; Cronin, 2008 for a review). However, similar to the ANS literature, inconsistencies with regard to the operationalization of social support yields mixed results regarding different models of social support, limiting our understanding of the specific conditions under which social support is more or less strongly operative (see Rueger et al., 2016). Based on previous findings that perceived support provides is more strongly related to depression than enacted support (Chu et al., 2010), a clearer understanding of the relationship between social support and depressive symptoms may be possible by further differentiating between facets of perceived social support. Following this notion, the present study aimed to answer the following research questions:\n(1) What indices best measure physiological reactivity under stressful and rewarding contexts?\n(2) What types of perceived social support serve as the strongest protective factors against depressive symptoms for individuals with different profiles of stress and reward reactivity?\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "(1)\tWhat indices best measure physiological reactivity under stressful and rewarding contexts?\nHypotheses: Given previous findings that biases between ANS branches (i.e., CAB) conferred risk in stress tasks (Byslma et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2020) and levels of reactivity across both branches (i.e., CAR) conferred risk in reward tasks (Kreibig et al., 2012), we hypothesize that CAB reactivity during a stress task and CAR reactivity during a reward task will be most related to depressive symptoms.\n \n(2)\tWhat types of perceived social support serve as the strongest protective factors against depressive symptoms for individuals with different profiles of stress and reward reactivity?\nHypotheses: Based on prior research that found responsiveness in one\u2019s interpersonal network to play a buffering role in stressful environments (Kane et al., 2012) we hypothesize that appraisal support would interact with CAB during the stress task to predict lower levels of depression, but not CAR in the reward task. In other words, for individuals with maladaptive stress-response profiles, engaging in social environments where they are able to discuss personal issues will be most protective against depressive symptoms under stressful situations. Similarly, we hypothesized that belongingness support will interact with CAR reactivity during the reward task and CAB during the stress task to predict lower levels of depression. \n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

therapeutic tool, and after having been incorporated into many types of therapy, has proven to be useful to reduce symptomology in a range of disorders, and generally increase well-being \u2013 particularly after longer-term training (such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, Davidson et al., 2003). However, much like other longer-term behavioural therapies, attrition rates are found to be as high as 38% (Arch et al., 2013), and current data demonstrate limited effectiveness for persons with a current diagnosis of some disorders (e.g. Strauss et al., 2014). Motivational and attentional difficulties may also get in the way of successful engagement, as well as cognitive patterns which seem naturally counter to the approach of mindfulness (e.g. avoidance as opposed to paying attention to one\u2019s experiences/thoughts). Additionally, symptoms of attentional disorders, anxiety and depression correlate negatively with trait mindfulness (Smalley et al., 2009, Keith et al., 2017), demonstrating that persons suffering from these disorders may be starting off at a disadvantage compared to a healthy sample before even beginning a mindfulness or similar programme.  \n\nOne way of approaching this issue is to combine behavioural and pharmacological approaches: just as drugs such as modafinil have been used to enhance \u2018vigilance\u2019, it may be useful to pair modafinil with a short-term mindfulness intervention in the early phases of mindfulness treatment. We recently tested this concept in a randomized controlled experiment testing the effects of a mindfulness (versus relaxation control) strategy and modafinil (versus placebo; Thomas et al., in prep). We demonstrated that modafinil (compared to placebo) increased state mindfulness, as well as improving engagement with both behavioural strategies (both during the first practice in the lab and time spent practicing in the week following the lab session). In that study, the behavioural strategies produced only limited differential effects (on heart rate variability), indicating increased parasympathetic activity following brief mindfulness training, but equivalent increases in state mindfulness.  \n\n \n\nHere, we seek to replicate these findings. However, instead of using only a self-report (state) measure of mindfulness as in our previous study, the active strategy in the current study will be a validated breath counting task, which serves as both the mindfulness exercise, and as a behavioural measure of mindfulness \u2018performance\u2019. We are also using a control strategy condition (arithmetic) which we believe is less likely to unintentionally produce mindfulness-like effects, allowing differential strategy effects to emerge more clearly.

However, much like other longer-term behavioural therapies, attrition rates are found to be as high as 38% (Arch et al., 2013), and current data demonstrate limited effectiveness for persons with a current diagnosis of some disorders (e.g. Strauss et al., 2014). Motivational and attentional difficulties may also get in the way of successful engagement, as well as cognitive patterns which seem naturally counter to the approach of mindfulness (e.g. avoidance as opposed to paying attention to one\u2019s experiences/thoughts). Additionally, symptoms of attentional disorders, anxiety and depression correlate negatively with trait mindfulness (Smalley et al., 2009, Keith et al., 2017), demonstrating that persons suffering from these disorders may be starting off at a disadvantage compared to a healthy sample before even beginning a mindfulness or similar programme.  \n\nOne way of approaching this issue is to combine behavioural and pharmacological approaches: just as drugs such as modafinil have been used to enhance \u2018vigilance\u2019, it may be useful to pair modafinil with a short-term mindfulness intervention in the early phases of mindfulness treatment. We recently tested this concept in a randomized controlled experiment testing the effects of a mindfulness (versus relaxation control) strategy and modafinil (versus placebo; Thomas et al., in prep). We demonstrated that modafinil (compared to placebo) increased state mindfulness, as well as improving engagement with both behavioural strategies (both during the first practice in the lab and time spent practicing in the week following the lab session). In that study, the behavioural strategies produced only limited differential effects (on heart rate variability), indicating increased parasympathetic activity following brief mindfulness training, but equivalent increases in state mindfulness.  \n\n \n\nHere, we seek to replicate these findings. However, instead of using only a self-report (state) measure of mindfulness as in our previous study, the active strategy in the current study will be a validated breath counting task, which serves as both the mindfulness exercise, and as a behavioural measure of mindfulness \u2018performance\u2019.

In working memory, it is defined as the inability to inhibit previously learned information that is not relevant to the current task (Kane &amp; Engle, 2000). The robust effects of proactive interference on working memory were first shown using verbal stimuli in adults (Keppel &amp; Underwood, 1962; Underwood, 1957; Wickens, Born, &amp; Allen, 1963). More recent studies revealed that proactive interference is present in WM tasks using visual stimuli as well (Makovski &amp; Jiang, 2008; Hartshorne, 2008). The results of these studies show that performance on subsequent trials suffers when subjects are presented with stimuli that have previously been presented.\n \tBecause of these robust effects found in adults, it is important to explore how interference might impact working memory capacity in toddlers or infants (see Zosh &amp; Feigenson, Oakes &amp; Kovack-Lesh, 2013). We are currently investigating how toddlers between the ages of 30-42 months may cope with the effects of proactive interference using a visual working memory task (Hamilton, Blaser &amp; Kaldy, 2020, preregistration: https://osf.io/3eg6h). This task (Delayed Match Retrieval) tests children\u2019s memory for object-location bindings and is similar to the popular game Memory or Concentration (Kaldy, Guillory, &amp; Blaser, 2016). Preliminary results from our study show that the effects of proactive interference (PI) are indeed present in toddlers in this VWM task between the ages of 30 and 42 months.\nIn light of this finding, it is relevant to pinpoint a potential source of the effects of PI found in toddlers. That is, is the interference originating from lingering \u2018residual\u2019 information from the previous trial or from a reactivation of previously learned information that is now in long-term memory? Research conducted using verbal stimuli with adults and older children suggest that the effects of PI are, indeed, caused by a reactivation of information rather than lingering information (Kail, 2002). The current work investigates the origin of PI in VWM in toddlers between 30 and 42 months of age in the same paradigm used in Hamilton et al. (2020).  \nDesign:\nThe study will use the Delayed Match Retrieval paradigm (Kaldy et al., 2016) adapted to a touchscreen tablet. Toddlers will see three cards appear on the screen in a triangular arrangement. The bottom cards will always consist of a match and non-match and the top card will always be the sample. First, the two bottom cards will flip over one at a time to reveal images of the match and non-match. The first card will flip over and reveal the image for a total of 3 seconds, then the second card will flip over for 3 seconds. Then both cards will be flipped face-down, then the sample card flips to reveal the image. The toddlers will have 10 seconds to choose the (still face-down) bottom card that they think depicts the same image as the sample. The presentation of the objects will be pseudorandom, such that the match will not be on the same side (left/right) more than twice in a row. \n\tThe test phase will consist of one single block of 16 trials. 8 of these 16 trials will be called A trials which will always use the same pair of target objects (with the location of the match object (left/right) randomized). In the other trials (B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I) the children will see a new pair of objects on every trial. The presentation of the trials will be such that A trials will be interleaved with B, C, D, etc. trials: A,B,A,C,A,D,A,E,A,F,A,G,A,H,A,I. If the effects of proactive interference are seen on A trials (i. e. WM performance decreases over time) this will provide evidence that the source of PI is indeed due to a reactivation of information from long-term memory and not because of a lingering \u2018residual\u2019 information from the previous trial. \nMethod:\nThe toddler will be seated at a table with the experimenter in front of a touchscreen. The task will be explained orally as well as demonstrated by the experimenter.  The parent will be seated to the side of the child and will be asked not to talk or gesture to the child while he or she is participating. The experiment will be run on a Microsoft Surface Go touchscreen tablet and all sessions will be videotaped.\nStimuli: \nThe stimuli will be virtual cards that depict images from the NOUN database (Horst &amp; Hout, 2016) that can be shown face up to reveal the images or flipped down to occlude the objects. The objects are pictures of non-objects and will be, therefore, unfamiliar to the toddlers as well as non-nameable. The study will be designed using OpenSesame 3.2.7 (Mathot, Schreij &amp; Theeuwes, 2012). \nProcedure: \nThe test session will consist of a directions phase where all cards will always be presented face-up and there will be no time-out meaning the cards will be displayed on the screen until the screen is touched. The experimenter will explain the task and take turns with the toddler responding on the touchscreen by touching the matching card. This phase will consist of four trials and no data will be collected. During the directions phase, if the child speaks another language other than English, the parents will be asked to translate what the experimenter has said. Additionally, if the child demonstrates difficulty touching the screen he or she will be permitted to point to the correct card and the experimenter will touch the card to which the toddler pointed.  \nUpon completion of the four directions trials the training phase will begin. Here, the cards will still be presented face up but during this phase, the toddler will have to respond within 10 seconds. If the toddler chooses the correct response three times in a row, the test phase will begin. If the child fails to answer correctly, the training phase will repeat a maximum of 8 times. After 8 trials, if the toddler fails to answer three trials correctly in a row, the test phase will begin, but data from these participants will not be included in the final data set. \nIn all phases of the experiment, when the correct answer is chosen, the card is flipped to reveal the match.  Additionally, a picture of Elmo accompanied by a correct-answer sound appears before the next trial starts. If the child chooses incorrectly, the next trial begins without the presentation of Elmo or the correct-answer sound. The responses will be recorded by OpenSesame 3.2.7 (Mathot et al., 2012). All sessions will be videotaped. Families will be offered stickers, a certificate of completion, a small gift and $20 for their participation. \n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

Participants will rate the physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects of engagement with three items from Rich et al.\u2019s (2010) measure (i.e., \u201cRight now, I am devoting a lot of energy to what I\u2019m doing.\u201d [physical], \u201cRight now, I am devoting a lot of attention to what I\u2019m doing.\u201d [cognitive], \u201cRight now, I am excited about what I\u2019m doing.\u201d [emotional]; 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).\nExhaustion. Participants will rate exhaustion with Maslach and Jackson\u2019s (1993) 5-item measure from the Maslach Burnout Inventory\u2013General Survey (e.g., \u201cRight now, I feel emotionally drained from what I\u2019m doing.\u201d; 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree).\nManipulation check. Participants will complete a 3-item leniency measure that was developed for our research. The items are \u201cI have been lenient to others at work,\u201d \u201cI have given others at work a lighter punishment for their misconduct than I could have,\u201d and \u201cI have been lenient in response to others\u2019 misconduct\u201d (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).

We will also use ANOVA to assess whether the individuals in the high leniency condition engage in more leniency than participants in the low leniency condition.

decisions in\nthe lexical decision task (Trifonova &amp; Adelman, 2019), picking up on an earlier report of this phenomenon (Schoonbaert &amp; Grainger, 2004). These letter repetition effects are in line with one particular orthographic coding scheme \u2013 open-bigram coding (Grainger &amp; van Heuven, 2004) - words containing repeated letters are harder to recognize since they are represented by fewer bigrams than words without repeated letters. On the basis of open-bigram coding we predicted that nonwords in a lexical decision task should also be sensitive to letter repetitions. In particular we propose to examine two types of nonword generated from the same baseword: 1) nonwords created by repeating one of the letters in the baseword; and 2) nonwords created by inserting a letter that is not present in the baseword. We reasoned that if the processing of a non-adjacent repeated letter is hindered in some way, then this should make it harder to reject a nonword formed by letter repetition compared with letter insertion.

These letter repetition effects are in line with one particular orthographic coding scheme \u2013 open-bigram coding (Grainger &amp; van Heuven, 2004) - words containing repeated letters are harder to recognize since they are represented by fewer bigrams than words without repeated letters. On the basis of open-bigram coding we predicted that nonwords in a lexical decision task should also be sensitive to letter repetitions. In particular we propose to examine two types of nonword generated from the same baseword: 1) nonwords created by repeating one of the letters in the baseword; and 2) nonwords created by inserting a letter that is not present in the baseword. We reasoned that if the processing of a non-adjacent repeated letter is hindered in some way, then this should make it harder to reject a nonword formed by letter repetition compared with letter insertion. On the basis of the results of Trifonova and Adelman (2019) we exclude adjacent letter repetitions (a special case) and distant letter repetitions (separated by more than 4 letters).

Mean diff. in agreement = \"congenial\" + demographic covariates + political orientation + participant fixed effect (we will run two separate models for Democrats and Republicans).\n\n(v) People believe others will agree with them in the future more strongly for the rejection of false beliefs as compared to the acceptance of true beliefs. In other words, people believe myths will be dispelled over time more than they believe truth will be accepted.\n\nTwo-tailed t-test: Is the mean difference between future and current agreement significantly larger for items which participants believe to be false than for items participants believe to be true?\n\nLinear regression: Is the beta for \"believe\" different from zero and negative in the following specification?
