Our research group was selected to participate in the IARPA CREATE program, to investigate (inter alia) how crowdsourcing methods might contribute to intelligence work.

See 'SWARM: Cultivating Evidence-Based Reasoning' by van Gelder et al. (2018) for details of the platform.\n\nOur previous research suggests that, using the SWARM platform, teams comprised of members of the public, recruited over Facebook, are able to produce analysis of quality comparable to that produced by teams of professional intelligence analysts. In February-March 2020, our research group is running the 'Hunt Challenge 2020', an observational study in which both public and professional teams will use the SWARM platform to respond to a series of intelligence-type problems. Reports produced by teams will then be rated on quality of reasoning (QoR) using the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's (ODNI) Rating Scale for Evaluating Analytic Tradecraft Standards.\n\nThe study will produce a rich dataset, including patterns of user collaboration and interaction with the platform. One of our main research aims, addressed in this registration, is to compare the QoR in reports generated by public and professional teams. Based on previous studies, we believe that public teams will produce reasoning that is at least as good as that of professional intelligence teams. Additionally, we wish to validate a model for predicting QoR scores based on attributes of the team members and attributes of their reasoning process, which we developed using data from a similar challenge we ran in 2018.\n\nWe have a number of secondary aims, which will be the subject of exploratory analysis.

A public-facing leaderboard (with pseudonymous team names) will be visible to all participants.\n\nThere are 4 evaluators who are being employed as research assistants to complete the evaluations. 3 have completed (and 1 is completing) a PhD in Humanities. 3 have 20+ hours experience rating products using the ODNI from past studies our research group has run. All raters will receive roughly 9 hours of training in the ODNI (including a calibration exercise) before evaluating products for this study.\n\nEach week, the top-rated reports produced by all teams for that problem will be randomly assigned to four groups (A,B,C,D). Then each rater will evaluate reports in one of four orders (ABC, BCD, CDA, DAB etc.) such that each report is rated 3 times, by three different raters.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "EILIGIBILITY\n\nParticipants must be over 18 years of age and cannot be members of our (extended) research group or have participated in any pilot studies in which they will have already seen versions of the products.

measure, the Self-Efficacy in Managing Social Identities (SEMSI) scale. This will be done through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to confirm a factor structure and psychometric validity of this scale. The development of this scale will assist researchers in understanding the factors that predict effective self-management of multiple social groups, and how this relates to well-being. \n\nMethod: The study will be split into two phases. For both phases of this research, participants will need to have English language proficiency, and be 18 years or older to participate.\n\tPhase I: Psychology student participants (n = 200) from the University of Queensland (UQ) will complete an online survey of generated scale items and participants will be reimbursed with course credit for their time. The scale items will be generated based on literature review and expert recommendations (through email and face to face consultation with members of the UQ Social Identity and Groups Network, and international researchers known to the group). \n\n\tPhase II: For phase two, participants from a community sample (n = 200), will complete the second online survey. This community sample will be recruited from crowdsourcing platform, Prolific (https://www.prolific.ac). Participants will be reimbursed depending on the length of survey and according to Prolific guidelines at a minimum of \u00a35 p/h.\n\nAnalysis plan:\n\tPhase I: On the basis of generally accepted conventions regarding what constitutes adequate psychometric properties of a new scale (Clark &amp; Watson, 1995), the items will first be factor analysed to examine the correlations between constructs and the factor structure for the subgroups of each factor. Reliability analyses will be conducted to test internal consistency and stability. \n\nSpecifically, exploratory factor analysis will be used on the data gathered from the first survey. The factor solution will be based on a combination of the scree test, Kaiser-Guttman rule (factors with an Eigenvalue &gt; 1), and clear factor loadings. Means, standard deviations, and correlations will also be calculated for the survey items. After the initial factor analysis, items with the strongest factor loadings onto the best factor structure for the scale will be selected and used for the second survey.\n\n\tPhase II: Confirmatory factor analysis will be applied to the collected data using Structural Equation Modelling. Multiple indices will be used to evaluate model fit: root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), standardised root mean residual (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), and non-normative fit index. To determine the convergent and discriminant validity of the SEMSI scale, correlations will be calculated between the SEMSI and other psychometrically valid scales. These scales include the UCLA-Loneliness Scale (ULS-8; Hays &amp; DiMatteo, 1987), group listing on the Exeter Transition Scale (EXITS; Haslam et al., 2008), social anxiety measured by the Mini-SPIN (Connor et al., 2001), the mistrust subscale from the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ; Young, 2014), the extraversion subscale from the Big Five Inventory (John, Donahue, &amp; Kentle, 1991), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE; Leary, 1983), and psychological distress measured by the K6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003). \n\nGreater self-efficacy in managing multiple social identities is predicted to be associated with higher social and well-being outcomes. It is predicted that the SEMSI scale will be negatively correlated with scales that predict more negative social and well-being outcomes (e.g., ULS-8, Mini-SPIN, BFNE, and mistrust subscale). It is predicted that the SEMSI scale will be positively correlated with scales that predict more improved social and well-being outcomes (e.g., EXITS and extraversion subscale). Independent sample t-tests will be conducted on the scale to determine whether there are any differences due to gender, age, or ethnicity.

measure, the Self-Efficacy in Managing Social Identities (SEMSI) scale. This will be done through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to confirm a factor structure and psychometric validity of this scale. The development of this scale will assist researchers in understanding the factors that predict effective self-management of multiple social groups, and how this relates to well-being. \n\nMethod: The study will be split into two phases. For both phases of this research, participants will need to have English language proficiency, and be 18 years or older to participate.\n\tPhase I: Psychology student participants (n = 200) from the University of Queensland (UQ) will complete an online survey of generated scale items and participants will be reimbursed with course credit for their time. The scale items will be generated based on literature review and expert recommendations (through email and face to face consultation with members of the UQ Social Identity and Groups Network, and international researchers known to the group). \n\n\tPhase II: For phase two, participants from a community sample (n = 200), will complete the second online survey. This community sample will be recruited from crowdsourcing platform, Prolific (https://www.prolific.ac). Participants will be reimbursed depending on the length of survey and according to Prolific guidelines at a minimum of \u00a35 p/h.\n\nAnalysis plan:\n\tPhase I: On the basis of generally accepted conventions regarding what constitutes adequate psychometric properties of a new scale (Clark &amp; Watson, 1995), the items will first be factor analysed to examine the correlations between constructs and the factor structure for the subgroups of each factor. Reliability analyses will be conducted to test internal consistency and stability. \n\nSpecifically, exploratory factor analysis will be used on the data gathered from the first survey. The factor solution will be based on a combination of the scree test, Kaiser-Guttman rule (factors with an Eigenvalue &gt; 1), and clear factor loadings. Means, standard deviations, and correlations will also be calculated for the survey items. After the initial factor analysis, items with the strongest factor loadings onto the best factor structure for the scale will be selected and used for the second survey.\n\n\tPhase II: Confirmatory factor analysis will be applied to the collected data using Structural Equation Modelling. Multiple indices will be used to evaluate model fit: root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), standardised root mean residual (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), and non-normative fit index. To determine the convergent and discriminant validity of the SEMSI scale, correlations will be calculated between the SEMSI and other psychometrically valid scales. These scales include the UCLA-Loneliness Scale (ULS-8; Hays &amp; DiMatteo, 1987), group listing on the Exeter Transition Scale (EXITS; Haslam et al., 2008), social anxiety measured by the Mini-SPIN (Connor et al., 2001), the mistrust subscale from the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ; Young, 2014), the extraversion subscale from the Big Five Inventory (John, Donahue, &amp; Kentle, 1991), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE; Leary, 1983), and psychological distress measured by the K6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003). \n\nGreater self-efficacy in managing multiple social identities is predicted to be associated with higher social and well-being outcomes. It is predicted that the SEMSI scale will be negatively correlated with scales that predict more negative social and well-being outcomes (e.g., ULS-8, Mini-SPIN, BFNE, and mistrust subscale). It is predicted that the SEMSI scale will be positively correlated with scales that predict more improved social and well-being outcomes (e.g., EXITS and extraversion subscale). Independent sample t-tests will be conducted on the scale to determine whether there are any differences due to gender, age, or ethnicity.
