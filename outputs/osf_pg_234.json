Biofeedback interventions that include guided breathing have shown to be effective in increasing HRV and facilitate stress recovery.  \nObjective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a brief app-based biofeedback breathing intervention (BioBase) in enhancing physiological recovery among employees who were induced to cognitive and emotional stress in the laboratory.\nMethods: In total 75 full-time employees took part. Inter-beat-intervals (RR) were recorded continuously for 5 min. of baseline, followed by cognitive and emotional stress induction. The session ended with a 5 min. recovery period during which participants were randomly allocated in three conditions: control, mindfulness or app-based biofeedback breathing (BioBase). Subjective tension was assessed at the end of each period.\nResults: Levels of subjective tension significantly increased following the stress induction. HRV significantly decreased following the stress period. At the recovery phase there was a significant increase in the root mean square of successive differences (p=.002), the percentage of successive RR that differ by &gt;50ms (p=.008) and high frequency (p=.012) for those in the BioBase breathing condition than the mindfulness and the control group.\nConclusions: Biofeedback breathing interventions digitally delivered through a commercially available app. can be effective in facilitating stress recovery among employees. These findings contribute to m-health literature on the beneficial effects of brief biofeedback interventions on employees\u2019 cardiovascular health.\n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-01T21:22:54.271208", "date_modified": "2020-03-01T19:56:14.276693", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "5f5f1d2f4a261f38a94e00d94d6c7e2b8dbeb76ec63b2bd7efc892b5b97b4883a2b4ac6fa0f7b24a69608cfe9e2eda8dd8c2322e6aacc44b36ed49f24b1508f1135c51844db57d21deacb72b4e133dcc0e92238fa48a7633264f205773c58ec2793b45ea45e60ee150864a49bc35a821fa81e401e3fd5d8dff335d064a8c63bba25d45487f0e03591bb9dd8a15bbfd4a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-01T21:22:54.254863", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Exploring the effects of a brief biofeedback breathing session on physiological recovery after cognitive and emotional stress in employees: a randomised study"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Olga Chelidoni, Mark Cropley, David Plans"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Biofeedback and mindfulness have been suggested to confer beneficial effects for individuals physical health.

academic performance (e.g., Hyde &amp; Mertz, 2009; O\u2019Dea, Lagisz, Jennions, &amp; Nakagawa, 2018) and cognitive abilities (e.g., Hedges &amp; Norwell, 1995). Most of these studies \u2013 especially those that are more recent and examine larger datasets and sample sizes (e.g., O\u2019Dea et al., 2018) \u2013 have concluded that, on average, girls\u2019 academic performance is at similar levels or higher levels when compared to that of boys. Even in subjects such as mathematics, which has been stereotypically associated with boys performing better at, girls\u2019 average performance is not significantly different from that of boys (Hyde &amp; Mertz, 2009). For example, in Hyde and Mertz\u2019s examination (2009) of over seven million children's and youth\u2019s math performance in school, they found that gender differences were near zero in all tested grades, ranging from grade two to grade eleven, and in all tested ethnicities, including African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Whites.\n\nMany studies that examine gender differences in average performance also examine gender differences in variability of performance (e.g., Hedges &amp; Norwell, 1995; Hyde &amp; Mertz, 2009; O\u2019Dea et al., 2018). Several studies looking at a variety of different kinds of performance (e.g., math tests, science tests, spatial cognition, reading tests, school grades in STEM and non-STEM subjects) with large and diverse samples have found greater variability in boys\u2019 performance when compared to that of girls (Hedges &amp; Norwell, 1995; Hyde &amp; Mertz, 2009; Machin &amp; Pekkarinen, 2008). Greater variability leads to increased gender imbalances among those at the very top. For example, Hedges and Norwell (1995) found that in a dataset of over 70,000 15-year-olds, the male-to-female ratio was 1.3 in the top 10%, 1.5 in the top 5%, 2.1 in the top 3%, and 7.0 in the top 1%.\n\nGiven how such an imbalance constrains girls' development and contributes to stereotypes associating males with brilliance, we want to research why and when girls choose not to stand out and try to perform at the highest levels. In this study, our research aims to investigate the developmental roots of why there are more top-performing males than females in various STEM and non-STEM fields. Specifically, do gender differences emerge in how willing children are to try to perform at the highest levels? If so, when do these gender differences emerge and how do they develop across time? Why might these differences emerge (e.g., differences in persistence, differences in willingness to share performance with others, etc.)? \n\nPlease refer to the \"Study design\" section for a detailed description of the study procedure and a full list of research questions."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We predict that there will be an interaction effect between child gender (boy or girl) and condition (top or average) in both children's persistence and their willingness to share performance with peers and their best friends.

Then, the participant will be asked (1) if s/he would like to share her/his performance with her/his peers by being included in the classroom bulletin board, (2) if s/he would like to share her/his performance with her/his best friend, and (3) if s/he would like to share her/his performance with her/his parents through a parent letter that explains the game that was played and includes the participant\u2019s performance on it. Participants\u2019 willingness to publicize their performance with peers, their best friend, and their parents, respectively, is measured by their binary choices on these three questions. For these three variables, we also have a 2 X 2 design between condition (top, average) and participant gender (boy, girl).\n\nIn the end, the experimenter will thank the participant again for her/his participation and explain that because they do not want to hurt the feelings of other students, a bulletin board about this game will not be made and the parent letter will not be sent.", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d359", "file_name": "Rarity - Elementary Script - FINAL.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/jd4he/files/osfstorage/5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d359", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d359"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "dcc250129b5663d56d84686cf2e6a883225697160d66f2ef6804943fbc6ebddf"}}, {"file_id": "5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d35b", "file_name": "Rarity_Elementary.qsf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/jd4he/files/osfstorage/5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d35b", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5c9b3eef5d89021806d35b"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "f61b2bcc97c29db69d66b58ab1289bbfd421830a58dffa5f0b9361ab2cc5de31"}}], "q12.question": "We will recruit a total of 128 children (50% female) from grades 4 and 5 in New York City public elementary schools, with 64 children (32 boys and 32 girls) in each condition.
