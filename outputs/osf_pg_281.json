"description": "The error related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection typically appearing in centro-frontal regions after an error has been committed (Hajcak 2012). It is considered to reflect individual sensitivity to threat and to be modulated by unpredictable contexts. In this study we aim to replicate and expand previous data showing that the amplitude of the ERN is increased when unpredictable but not predictable tones occur in the background (Jackson et al., 2015). Participants will perform a Flanker task in four different conditions: during a predictable pattern of tones, during an unpredictable pattern of tones (replication part), during a predictable pattern of mildly painful cutaneous stimuli and during an unpredictable pattern of mildly painful cutaneous stimuli (expansion). The order of the stimuli will be counterbalanced across participants. High density (129 channels) EEG will be recorded. Participants will rate for each condition their anxiety, the un-/predictability, the unpleasantness and the intensity of the stimulus. In addition, participants will fill in the questionnaires - Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1984; Engelen, De Peuter, Victoir, Van Diest, &amp; Van den Bergh, 2006), Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI, Deacon et al., 2004; Peterson &amp; Heilbronner, 1987), Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) (Helsen, Van den Bussche, Vlaeyen, &amp; Goubert, 2013), Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier et al.

Predictable and unpredictable sequences will contain an identical number of stimuli and equivalent mean stimuli spacing. \nLevel of unpleasantness of acoustic and electric stimuli: The perceptual threshold for the electrical stimulus will be established individually, in order to match the perceived unpleasantness of the original sound with an intensity of the electrical stimulus having a similar perceived unpleasantness. To this aim, the difference between \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cunpleasantness\u201d will be explained to the participant. The tone used in the original study, delivered in a 5\u201d predictable sequence, will be presented to the participant, who will rate it for unpleasantness, using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = not unpleasant to 7 = extremely unpleasant. Like in the original study, the acoustic stimuli will be produced using a carrier frequency of 1 kHz with pulse duration of 40 ms and mean pulse spacing of 200 ms (5 Hz pulse repetition rate). The sequences will be played at 85 dB through external computer speakers positioned approximately 50 cm in front of the participant (Jackson et al., 2015). Next, through a bar electrode fixed to the posterior skin surface of the participant's wrist (from the non-dominant hand), the participant will receive an electrical stimulation at very low intensity (0.4mA) and will be asked to signal any sensation. They will receive additional increasing stimulations (in steps of 0.2mA), until they have a first sensation. After that, they will receive stimulation with the same intensity, until they can feel at least 5 out of 10 times. Predictable sequences of electrical stimuli, of 5\u201d will be applied through a bar electrode to the posterior skin surface of the participant's wrist (from the non-dominant hand), using the intensity established in the previous step. Stimuli of a duration of 2ms each will be delivered with an inter-stimulus interval of 498ms. The participant will be asked to rate the unpleasantness, using a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = not unpleasant to 7 = extremely unpleasant. The intensity of electrical stimulation sequence will be increased with steps of 0.2mA, until the perceived unpleasantness will be the same as that for the acoustic stimuli. The determined intensity of electrical stimulus (in mA), having the same perceived unpleasantness as acoustic stimuli will be used in the test phase. \nError-related behaviour: Participants\u2019 errors are elicited using an Eriksen Flanker Task. This is a response inhibition test in which participants are requested to focus on a leftward or rightward pointing arrow presented centrally on a monitor while ignoring distracting flanking arrows pointing in the same or in the opposite direction. The task is to indicate the direction of the target / central arrow as quickly and as precisely as possible, by pressing the left/right mouse button. One trial consists of the presentation of 5 arrowheads for 200ms, followed by a response phase (1000ms) and a jittered inter-trial interval (mean: 800ms), which sums up to 2000ms per trial. There are two types of trials (congruent: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and non-congruent: &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;) \u2013 randomly determined, half from every type. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Behavioral measures: Number of errors; Reaction times\nEEG measures: Error Related Negativity (ERN) amplitude; Correct Related Negativity (CRN) amplitude\nSelf-reported measures: Rated anxiety to predictable / unpredictable tone / electric stimuli, measured with a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7 (Not anxious - Extremely anxious); Rated unpleasantness after each condition, measured with a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7 (Not unpleasant \u2013 Extremely unpleasant); Rated predictability after each condition measured with a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7 (Predictable - Highly unpredictable); Rated intensity after each condition measured with a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7 (Low intensity \u2013 Extreme Intensity); Preferred Predictable / Unpredictable condition after each type of stimuli; Preferred Acoustic Unpredictable /Electric Unpredictable condition.\nQuestionnaires results: Intolerance of Uncertainty (IoU) (Helsen, Van den Bussche, Vlaeyen, &amp; Goubert, 2013); Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS, Sullivan, 1995).\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "During each condition, 129\u2010channel EEG (Philips Electrical Geodesics Inc., Eugene, USA) will be continuously recorded using a sampling rate of 250 Hz.

The eight distinct scenarios are counterbalanced, such that each scenario is attached to a black male face, a black female face, a white male face, or a white female face. Each of these four pairings is presented with either primary (happy/sad) or secondary (proud/jealous) emotion labels, thus resulting in eight versions of the study. \n\nFor each study version, half of the videos describe the target using primary emotion labels (happy/sad), and the other half describe the target using secondary emotion labels (proud/jealous). Emotion label is counterbalanced, such that half of the participants will see the same four faces (1 black male, 1 black female, 1 white male, 1 white female) described with primary emotion labels, while the remaining participants will see these same four faces described with secondary emotion labels (and vice versa for the other four faces). \n\nAfter viewing each video, participants will be presented with a single pair of images of the target\u2019s face, including the original image next to one that varies slightly in facial morphology. They will be asked to identify which face they have just seen by pressing one of two keys on a laptop keyboard. The positioning of the original face (left or right side of the screen) will alternate across all eight trials and is counterbalanced across participants, such that half of the participants will see the same four faces on the left side of the screen, while the remaining participants will these same four faces on the right side of the screen (and vice versa for the other four faces). \n\nFor each study version, the stimuli are arranged across two distinct blocks: primary and secondary. Within each block, the four faces described with either primary or secondary labels are presented in randomized order. The order of the two blocks is also randomized.\n\nBefore beginning the eight test trials, each participant will be led through a practice trial.\n\nThe study will be run using the software program Testable, which will record accuracy and reaction time for each trial.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited by establishing partnerships with local schools and museums.
