one polling station the entire day -- as well as their spillover effects on the communities to which they are deployed and on nearby polling stations that do no have an observer. The paper is part of a larger project on the influence of election observers during Ghana's 2012 presidential elections. The current paper builds on findings reported in (Asunka et al., 2013). That paper analyzed objective data about electoral results that were collected from polling stations. The results show reductions of election fraud in the polling stations where observers are deployed but evidence of displacement effects of observers onto unobserved stations. Displacement occurs in areas where a single political party is electorally dominant. In electorally competitive areas, there is no displacement and instead there is evidence of a slight deterrent effect. The analyses described in this pre-analysis plan will use data collected in a household survey administered to approximately 6,000 Ghanaians that was carried out in the communities surrounding the sample polling stations. The data were collected before registration of this pre-analysis plan. However, the analyses outlined below have not yet been conducted and the indices that we propose to use as dependent variables in the study have not been constructed. The survey asked about 40 questions designed to elicit information about (among other things) violence and harassment that respondents observed or experienced on or prior to election day both inside polling stations and in their communities. We will use these data to study how observers impact patterns of electoral violence and the intimidation of voters.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"H1: Observers reduce harassment and/or intimidation inside polling stations where they are deployed.

H2c: Observers displace harassment and/or intimidation into the communities surrounding the polling stations where they are deployed. H2d: Observers deter harassment and/or intimidation in the communities surrounding the polling stations where they are deployed. H3a: The direct effect of observers will be bigger in political party strongholds. H3b: On the other hand, the ability of political parties to respond strategically to observers will also be bigger in stronghold areas. The displacement effects of observers will therefore be larger in stronghold areas.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"We will first estimate the direct effect of observers using a difference-of-means test. We will also run linear regressions in which we include controls for each of our blocking variables -- polling station density, electoral competition, and observer saturation. We note, however, that an unbiased estimate of observers' direct effects would compare outcomes in treated polling places to those in a \"\"pure control\"\" group. In this case, a pure control would be an unobserved polling station located in a constituency without any observers. Although ideal for estimation purposes, we were unable to create such control constituencies. The mission of our partner, Ghana's electoral observation group, is to reduce fraud and improve the overall quality of elections. There were therefore programmatic reasons to send observers to every constituency in the country. In the absence of a pure control group, we will use our data to construct a set of estimated pure control outcomes. We use these estimated pure control outcomes to adjust our causal effect estimates. We adopt two main approaches. In our first approach, we use outcomes in control stations in the low saturation constituencies as our estimate of the pure control outcome. In these constituencies, fewer than 10 percent of all polling stations are observed, which ensures minimal contamination from spillover. In our second approach, we assume a linear relationship between constituency observer saturation and outcomes in the control group. This assumption allows us to generate an estimate of the amount of violence/intimidation at pure control stations -- that is, polling stations where observer saturation is equal to zero. We use these two estimates of the pure control outcome to adjust our estimate of observers' direct causal effect. To identify generalized spillover within constituencies, we compare outcomes in control polling places at each level of observer saturation. We will do so graphically, with differences-of-means tests, and regression models in which we interact our observer treatment indicator with indicators of constituency level observer saturation. An increase in violence/intimidation in control polling places as observer saturation increases is evidence that observers displace fraud to polling places within the same constituency. A decrease in violence/intimidation in control polling places as the observer saturation increases is evidence of a deterrent effect. To identify spatial spillover effects, we consider spatial spillovers within Electoral Areas (EAs). EAs are political units smaller than constituencies from which voters elect local government councilors. Each parliamentary constituency in Ghana is divided into approximately 25 Electoral Areas, with approximately 5 polling stations within each. Polling places in the same EA are closer to one another than they are to most other polling places outside the EA. We can therefore use EAs to study the effect of having an observer nearby. Our randomization process places stations into four potential experimental conditions: Y_{01}-- treated stations with no other observers present in the same EA Y_{11}-- treated stations with at least one other observer in the same EA Y_{10}-- control stations with at least one observer present in the same EA Y_{00}-- control stations with no observers in the same EA To calculate spatial spillover effects on control stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{10} to outcomes in Y_{00}. That is, we will examine whether outcomes in control polling stations with an observer nearby are different from those at control polling stations without any observers nearby. To calculate spatial spillover effects on observed stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{11} to outcomes in Y_{01}. That is, we will examine whether outcomes in observed polling stations with another observer nearby are different from those at observed polling places without another observer nearby. Conditional on constituency saturation, each polling station has an equal probability of being treated with an observer. However, polling stations are not distributed equally in space or across EAs. As a result, each sampled polling station does not have an equal probability of landing in each of the four experimental conditions. This difference in treatment assignment probability implies that a simple difference-in-means comparison between the relevant experimental groups would generate biased estimates of spatial spillover effects. We therefore estimate treatment assignment probabilities using simulation methods.

The paper is part of a larger project on the influence of election observers during Ghana's 2012 presidential elections. The current paper builds on findings reported in (Asunka et al., 2013). That paper analyzed objective data about electoral results that were collected from polling stations. The results show reductions of election fraud in the polling stations where observers are deployed but evidence of displacement effects of observers onto unobserved stations. Displacement occurs in areas where a single political party is electorally dominant. In electorally competitive areas, there is no displacement and instead there is evidence of a slight deterrent effect. The analyses described in this pre-analysis plan will use data collected in a household survey administered to approximately 6,000 Ghanaians that was carried out in the communities surrounding the sample polling stations. The data were collected before registration of this pre-analysis plan. However, the analyses outlined below have not yet been conducted and the indices that we propose to use as dependent variables in the study have not been constructed. The survey asked about 40 questions designed to elicit information about (among other things) violence and harassment that respondents observed or experienced on or prior to election day both inside polling stations and in their communities. We will use these data to study how observers impact patterns of electoral violence and the intimidation of voters.\"", "q16": "\"H1: Observers reduce harassment and/or intimidation inside polling stations where they are deployed. H2a: Observers displace harassment and/or intimidation to polling stations in the same constituency that are not under observation. H2b: Observers displace harassment and/or intimidation to polling stations that are spatially proximate and that are not under observation. H2c: Observers displace harassment and/or intimidation into the communities surrounding the polling stations where they are deployed. H2d: Observers deter harassment and/or intimidation in the communities surrounding the polling stations where they are deployed. H3a: The direct effect of observers will be bigger in political party strongholds. H3b: On the other hand, the ability of political parties to respond strategically to observers will also be bigger in stronghold areas. The displacement effects of observers will therefore be larger in stronghold areas.\"", "q17": "\"We will first estimate the direct effect of observers using a difference-of-means test. We will also run linear regressions in which we include controls for each of our blocking variables -- polling station density, electoral competition, and observer saturation. We note, however, that an unbiased estimate of observers' direct effects would compare outcomes in treated polling places to those in a \"\"pure control\"\" group. In this case, a pure control would be an unobserved polling station located in a constituency without any observers. Although ideal for estimation purposes, we were unable to create such control constituencies. The mission of our partner, Ghana's electoral observation group, is to reduce fraud and improve the overall quality of elections. There were therefore programmatic reasons to send observers to every constituency in the country. In the absence of a pure control group, we will use our data to construct a set of estimated pure control outcomes. We use these estimated pure control outcomes to adjust our causal effect estimates. We adopt two main approaches. In our first approach, we use outcomes in control stations in the low saturation constituencies as our estimate of the pure control outcome. In these constituencies, fewer than 10 percent of all polling stations are observed, which ensures minimal contamination from spillover. In our second approach, we assume a linear relationship between constituency observer saturation and outcomes in the control group. This assumption allows us to generate an estimate of the amount of violence/intimidation at pure control stations -- that is, polling stations where observer saturation is equal to zero. We use these two estimates of the pure control outcome to adjust our estimate of observers' direct causal effect. To identify generalized spillover within constituencies, we compare outcomes in control polling places at each level of observer saturation. We will do so graphically, with differences-of-means tests, and regression models in which we interact our observer treatment indicator with indicators of constituency level observer saturation. An increase in violence/intimidation in control polling places as observer saturation increases is evidence that observers displace fraud to polling places within the same constituency. A decrease in violence/intimidation in control polling places as the observer saturation increases is evidence of a deterrent effect. To identify spatial spillover effects, we consider spatial spillovers within Electoral Areas (EAs). EAs are political units smaller than constituencies from which voters elect local government councilors. Each parliamentary constituency in Ghana is divided into approximately 25 Electoral Areas, with approximately 5 polling stations within each. Polling places in the same EA are closer to one another than they are to most other polling places outside the EA. We can therefore use EAs to study the effect of having an observer nearby. Our randomization process places stations into four potential experimental conditions: Y_{01}-- treated stations with no other observers present in the same EA Y_{11}-- treated stations with at least one other observer in the same EA Y_{10}-- control stations with at least one observer present in the same EA Y_{00}-- control stations with no observers in the same EA To calculate spatial spillover effects on control stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{10} to outcomes in Y_{00}. That is, we will examine whether outcomes in control polling stations with an observer nearby are different from those at control polling stations without any observers nearby. To calculate spatial spillover effects on observed stations, we will compare outcomes in Y_{11} to outcomes in Y_{01}. That is, we will examine whether outcomes in observed polling stations with another observer nearby are different from those at observed polling places without another observer nearby. Conditional on constituency saturation, each polling station has an equal probability of being treated with an observer. However, polling stations are not distributed equally in space or across EAs. As a result, each sampled polling station does not have an equal probability of landing in each of the four experimental conditions. This difference in treatment assignment probability implies that a simple difference-in-means comparison between the relevant experimental groups would generate biased estimates of spatial spillover effects. We therefore estimate treatment assignment probabilities using simulation methods. We will replicate our treatment assignment process 10,000 times and use the distribution of treatment assignments to calculate the probabilities. We will then estimate the difference in weighted means between the relevant experimental groups, where we weight units by the inverse probability that they are assigned to their actual condition. To characterize the uncertainty of our estimates, we will use randomization inference assuming constant effects across all units.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23":

Virginia jurisdictions included were Lee, Scott, Washington, and Grayson Counties and Bristol City (\u201cVA border sample\u201d). Tennessee jurisdictions included were Johnson, Sullivan, Hawkins, Hancock, and Claiborne Counties (\u201cTN border sample\u201d). Registered voter lists were also obtained for Knox County, TN (\u201cKnoxville sample\u201d) and Roanoke City, VA (\u201cRoanoke sample\u201d). In all four samples, registered voters who had voted in both the 2008 and the 2010 general elections were dropped from the study. In the TN and VA border samples, one member of each household was then selected at random. Unselected members were dropped from the sample. In the TN border counties, this left a sample size of 64,205. Of these, 21,796 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification. In the VA border counties, this left a sample size of 34,688. Of these, 25,000 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification. The following STATA code, used on the VA border sample sample, illustrates the procedure by which one member of each household was selected at random and 25,000 retained for potential sample inclusion. Analogous code was used on each other sample: set seed 3967660 gen indivrandom=runiform() sort hhid indivrandom by hhid: keep if _n==1 set seed 3341645 gen indivrandom2=runiform() sort indivrandom2 generate condition=\"\"To Be Assigned\"\" in 1/25000 drop if condition==\"\"\"\" In the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, further steps were taken in order to approximate a black oversample, which was targeted to constitute 20% of each state\u2019s total sample. In the Knoxville sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 37914 or 37915, which were 39% black and 73% black respectively in the 2010 Census. One member of each household was selected at random to be retained in the sample while other household members were dropped. From among this subsample, registered voters were retained only if they resided in a precinct that had voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008. This yielded a Knoxville sample size of 5,449. In the Roanoke sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 24017, which was 66% black in the 2010 Census. One member of each household was retained at random. Since all precincts spanning this zip code voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008, no further registered voters were dropped from the Roanoke sample. The resulting sample size was 6,997. The resulting list of registered voters from each sample, as well as all out-of-sample household members within the selected households were then submitted for national change of address (NCOA) processing, to be purged of subjects who had relocated. Following the NCOA processing, all subjects who had relocated were dropped from the analysis. Randomization Remaining registered voters within each stratum (see table below) were assigned to one of four experimental conditions. 11% were assigned to the \u201cReminder\u201d treatment, 22% each to the \u201cWarning\u201d and \u201cHelp\u201d treatments, and the remaining 45% to a control condition (no mailing). The 4,541 subjects who remained in the Knoxville sample after NCOA, and the 4:1 Knoxville/Roanoke-to-border ratios determined the number of subjects that would be included overall in the other three samples (4,541 in Roanoke and 18,163 in each of the border samples). Subjects randomly assigned to no experimental condition were dropped from the analysis in order to achieve these sample sizes. Again, code used on the post-NCOA VA border sample illustrates the randomization procedure: set seed 3967658 gen indivrandom2=runiform() sort indivrandom2 generate condition=. replace condition = 0 in 1/8163 replace condition = 1 in 8164/10163 replace condition = 2 in 10164/14163 replace condition = 3 in 14164/18163 drop if condition==. Balance Statistics Voting history and age proved quite similar across experimental groups within each sample, suggesting that the randomization procedure was successful.

A table showing turnout by experimental group within each sample will indicate whether turnout rates differed by experimental treatment. Within each state sample (i.e. TN Border + Knoxville and VA Border + Roanoke) we will also regress turnout on dummies representing assignment to each treatment, a dummy to identify Knoxville/Roanoke (the black subsamples) from the border sample and interacting each treatment with the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy. This will be run with and without controls for turnout in the 2008 and 2010 elections. Finally, controls for age (consisting of one dummy variable identifying voters thirty and under and a second dummy identifying voters sixty-five and older) will be added to each of these regressions, and each age dummy will be interacted with each treatment to determine whether the messages have a particularly large impact among registered voters of particular age groups. To determine whether the effects of the mailings vary by household size and by household vote propensity composition, turnout in the experimental sample will be regressed on the treatment dummies, the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy, a variable measuring how many other registered voters reside in the same household as the voter, a variable measuring how many high-propensity registered voters (i.e. those who voted in both 2008 and 2010) reside in the household, and interactions between each treatment dummy and each of these variables. We will also estimate the sample average treatment effect by using inverse probability weights, which take into account the different probabilities of assignment within each block. A second set of analyses will analyze within-household spillover effects. Using the full sample of registered voters in the original lists obtained for the VA and TN border samples, and the sample of voters residing in the oversampled zip codes and precincts within the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, and eliminating subjects in the experimental sample, turnout will be regressed on a dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment, the individual\u2019s turnout in both 2008 and 2010, and the individual\u2019s age, as well as a dummy identifying Knoxville/Roanoke subjects. To determine whether spillover effects vary depending on the household member\u2019s baseline vote propensity, this same regression will be run with an interaction between turnout in 2008 and 2010 and the dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Natalie Leblanc -- direct mail consultant"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Assessing the Turnout Effects of Messages about Voter IDs", "q2": "Donald Green | Jack Citrin | Morris Levy", "q3": "20121026AA", "q4": "10/26/2012 - 04:55", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "", "q9": "", "q10": "", "q11": "", "q12": "", "q13": "", "q14": "No", "q15": "This experiment is designed to test the effects of three mailings on voter turnout: a simple reminder encouraging voter turnout, a reminder that also indicates that voters will be required to present ID, and a reminder that indicates that voters will be required to present ID and includes helpful information about how to obtain an ID.

In the TN border counties, this left a sample size of 64,205. Of these, 21,796 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification. In the VA border counties, this left a sample size of 34,688. Of these, 25,000 were randomly selected to stay in the sample pending address verification. The following STATA code, used on the VA border sample sample, illustrates the procedure by which one member of each household was selected at random and 25,000 retained for potential sample inclusion. Analogous code was used on each other sample: set seed 3967660 gen indivrandom=runiform() sort hhid indivrandom by hhid: keep if _n==1 set seed 3341645 gen indivrandom2=runiform() sort indivrandom2 generate condition=\"\"To Be Assigned\"\" in 1/25000 drop if condition==\"\"\"\" In the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, further steps were taken in order to approximate a black oversample, which was targeted to constitute 20% of each state\u2019s total sample. In the Knoxville sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 37914 or 37915, which were 39% black and 73% black respectively in the 2010 Census. One member of each household was selected at random to be retained in the sample while other household members were dropped. From among this subsample, registered voters were retained only if they resided in a precinct that had voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008. This yielded a Knoxville sample size of 5,449. In the Roanoke sample, subjects were retained only if they resided in zip code 24017, which was 66% black in the 2010 Census. One member of each household was retained at random. Since all precincts spanning this zip code voted at least 60% for the Obama ticket in 2008, no further registered voters were dropped from the Roanoke sample. The resulting sample size was 6,997. The resulting list of registered voters from each sample, as well as all out-of-sample household members within the selected households were then submitted for national change of address (NCOA) processing, to be purged of subjects who had relocated. Following the NCOA processing, all subjects who had relocated were dropped from the analysis. Randomization Remaining registered voters within each stratum (see table below) were assigned to one of four experimental conditions. 11% were assigned to the \u201cReminder\u201d treatment, 22% each to the \u201cWarning\u201d and \u201cHelp\u201d treatments, and the remaining 45% to a control condition (no mailing). The 4,541 subjects who remained in the Knoxville sample after NCOA, and the 4:1 Knoxville/Roanoke-to-border ratios determined the number of subjects that would be included overall in the other three samples (4,541 in Roanoke and 18,163 in each of the border samples). Subjects randomly assigned to no experimental condition were dropped from the analysis in order to achieve these sample sizes. Again, code used on the post-NCOA VA border sample illustrates the randomization procedure: set seed 3967658 gen indivrandom2=runiform() sort indivrandom2 generate condition=. replace condition = 0 in 1/8163 replace condition = 1 in 8164/10163 replace condition = 2 in 10164/14163 replace condition = 3 in 14164/18163 drop if condition==. Balance Statistics Voting history and age proved quite similar across experimental groups within each sample, suggesting that the randomization procedure was successful.

A table showing turnout by experimental group within each sample will indicate whether turnout rates differed by experimental treatment. Within each state sample (i.e. TN Border + Knoxville and VA Border + Roanoke) we will also regress turnout on dummies representing assignment to each treatment, a dummy to identify Knoxville/Roanoke (the black subsamples) from the border sample and interacting each treatment with the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy. This will be run with and without controls for turnout in the 2008 and 2010 elections. Finally, controls for age (consisting of one dummy variable identifying voters thirty and under and a second dummy identifying voters sixty-five and older) will be added to each of these regressions, and each age dummy will be interacted with each treatment to determine whether the messages have a particularly large impact among registered voters of particular age groups. To determine whether the effects of the mailings vary by household size and by household vote propensity composition, turnout in the experimental sample will be regressed on the treatment dummies, the Knoxville/Roanoke dummy, a variable measuring how many other registered voters reside in the same household as the voter, a variable measuring how many high-propensity registered voters (i.e. those who voted in both 2008 and 2010) reside in the household, and interactions between each treatment dummy and each of these variables. We will also estimate the sample average treatment effect by using inverse probability weights, which take into account the different probabilities of assignment within each block. A second set of analyses will analyze within-household spillover effects. Using the full sample of registered voters in the original lists obtained for the VA and TN border samples, and the sample of voters residing in the oversampled zip codes and precincts within the Knoxville and Roanoke samples, and eliminating subjects in the experimental sample, turnout will be regressed on a dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment, the individual\u2019s turnout in both 2008 and 2010, and the individual\u2019s age, as well as a dummy identifying Knoxville/Roanoke subjects. To determine whether spillover effects vary depending on the household member\u2019s baseline vote propensity, this same regression will be run with an interaction between turnout in 2008 and 2010 and the dummy identifying whether a household member received each treatment.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26": "Other (describe in
