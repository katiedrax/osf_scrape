A custom-built smartphone application initiated an experience sampling prompt any time the interbeat interval (IBI; also called heart period) changed by more than \u00b1167ms over an eight-second period, with these thresholds adjusted per participant to ensure they received a comparable number of prompts per day. Prompts were not generated if participants had moved substantially or shifted posture within the proceeding 30s. At each sampling event, participants were prompted to respond to a series of questions presented in smartphone application, including to freely list and provide intensity ratings for their experienced emotions. \n\nUpon completing experience sampling each day, participants automatically received an end-of-day survey, which they used to provide additional details about the prompts they completed throughout the day.

Eligible participants were non-smoking, fluent English-speakers, and excluded if they had a history of cardiovascular illness or stroke, chronic medical conditions, mental illness, asthma, skin allergies, or very sensitive skin. Eligible participants also confirmed they were not taking any medications known to influence physiological arousal including medications for ADHD, insomnia, anxiety, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy/seizures, cold/flu, or fever/allergies. Participants received $490 as compensation for completing all parts of the study, plus up to an additional $55 in compliance and task incentives. \n\nOf the 67 recruited participants, six withdrew and an additional nine were dismissed due to poor compliance.

On each day of experience sampling, participants came into the lab and were instrumented for peripheral physiological recordings. Participants were instructed to continue physiological recordings for eight hours each day, after which they were able to remove and recharge all equipment. Upon completing experience sampling each day, participants automatically received an end-of-day survey, which they used to provide additional details about the prompts they completed throughout the day.

Furthermore it is asked whether the respondents would share these headlines, like them on a social network site, think they are true, whether they have seen them before and whether they would like to know more about this headline. \n\n2) (risk) behavior: self-created\nThis variable is covered by a multiple answer scale. You can choose here: 1. I bought more supplies than usual. 2. I thought to myself: Now more than ever, I'd rather get sick faster than no bed in the intensive care unit afterwards. 3.  I have kept physical distance from people whom I usually shake hands with. 4.  I cancelled a meeting with friends at home. 5. I doubted the coverage of the \"mainstream\" media. 6. I forwarded a WhatsApp message where I did not know the sender personally. 7. I disinfected or washed my hands and/or objects (e.g. cell phone) more often. These items are measured using a 5 step scale : the scale sections are: never, rarely, sometimes, often, always. A high scale value therefore means a high level of behaviour in relation to the corona crisis\n\nfurther information about the other variables: \n1) authoritarianism: validated scala ist used Beierlein, C., Asbrock, F., Kauff, M., &amp; Schmidt, P. (2014). \n\n2) conspiracy mentality: validated scala is used Bruder, M., Haffke, P., Neave, N., Nouripanah, N., &amp; Imhoff, R. (2013).\n\n3) intolerance of uncertainty: validated scala is used and translated by the author Carleton, R. N., Norton, M. P. J., &amp; Asmundson, G. J. (2007). \n\n4) use of alternative media: From the Reuters digital news report (Newman et al., 2019)\n\n5) state uncertainty: self-created + 1 item of big five scale:  Rammstedt, B., Kemper, C. J., Klein, M. C., Beierlein, C., &amp; Kovaleva, A. (2012). \n\n6) trait uncertainty: self-created\n", "conditions": "conspiracy belief headlines (as stated above) \nconspiracy theory\n1.
