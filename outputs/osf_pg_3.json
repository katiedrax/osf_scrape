Modifications were done based on a pilot study (N = 62) according to which each triad was selected while making sure that both the taxonomic and thematic relations can be recognized by the majority, that taxonomically related items do not also connote any thematic relations and that thematically bound items are not perceived as examples of the same category in any sense. Pictures of the selected triads were standardized, paying attention to prevent any two items in a triad from being visually similar to influence response patterns. All pictures were transformed into monochrome. Participants will be presented with one target item and two other items -one taxonomically and the other thematically related to the target- and be asked to choose the one which is most closely related to the target item. Taxonomic pairings are associated with an analytic thinking style and thematic pairings with holistic thinking style. \n\nSecond, a proverb task (Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999) will be used to assess preferences for dialectical versus non-dialectical proverbs. The proverbs were selected among the ones used by Peng and Nisbett (1999), by Friedman, Chen, and Vid (2006) and additional Turkish proverbs which emphasize dialecticism/non-dialecticism. The selection was made based on content (whether the emphasis on dialecticism or its opposite is clear enough) by three independent coders. For each proverb, ratings of familiarity, frequency of use and poeticality will be used as control variables. In this task consisting of 16 proverbs (8 dialectical), participants will be asked to rate how much they like each proverb and how much they agree with each proverb on a 7-point scale. Proverb lists used in our first study and that will be used in this study can be found in the Files section of the project.\n\nFinally, the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS; Choi, Koo, &amp; Choi, 2007) as a self-report measure for cultural thought styles will be administered. The AHS consists of four subscales (causality, attitude toward contradiction, perception of change and locus of attention) with 6 items each on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree). We will use the version we used in our first study, with additional items we wrote.\n\nIn order to test the proposed relationship between holistic thinking and other cognitive variables previously studied in political psychology literature, the Multiple Stimulus Types Ambiguity Tolerance Scale-II (MSTAT-II; McLain, 2009) will be given. This scale is a 7-point Likert-type scale consisting of 13 items.\n\nTo test the presumptive trifold relationship between holism, collectivism, and\neconomic liberalism, the Relational-Interdependent Self-Construal (RISC; Cross, Bacon &amp; Morris, 2000) Scale\u2014previously translated and validated in Turkish (\u00d6zt\u00fcrk, G\u00f6ko\u011flu, &amp; Karagonlar, 2015)\u2014will be included. \n\nTo measure analytic cognitive style as defined by the dual process model of the mind, we will use two versions of the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT-I and CRT-II; Frederick, 2005; Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2016). The first consists of 3 and the second 4 logic questions and score on these tests are calculated by the total number of correct responses. \n\nPolitical ideology will be measured by a version of the Scale of Social Conservatism -originally created by Henningham (1996) for the Australian culture and adapted to American culture by Piazza and Landy (2013)- revised by Y\u0131lmaz and Sar\u0131bay (2016) to adapt to Turkish politics. The scale consists of 14 items each concerning a social issue (legalization of marijuana, gay marriage etc.) to which responses range from -5 (strongly against) to +5 (not at all against). \n\nEconomic conservatism will be measured by the Economic Conservatism Scale originated by Y\u0131lmaz and Sar\u0131bay (2016), consisting of 16 items on a 7-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree). Sample items are \"The government should not interfere in the economics\" and \"The government should collect higher taxes from the rich and lower taxes from the poor to reduce income equality\". \n\nFinally, in demographic form, participants will be asked several demographic questions such as their gender, age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status (SES), hometown, hometown size, religious affiliation, and religiosity. SES will be measured by the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, &amp; Ickovics, 2000) in which participants are asked to indicate their relative place in the society on an image of a ladder of 10 steps. Religiosity will be measured by single item asking participants the extent to which they feel religious on a scale of 1 (not at all religious) to 7 (highly religious). Also, political ideology will be measured by a single item scale ranging from 1 (very liberal) to 7 (very conservative). \n\nIn addition, we have 2 attention check questions (\"Please respond to this question as \"I completely disagree\" and \"I have never drunk water in my life\"), one within the AHS and the other in the Economic Conservatism Scale.

We will use this score in the correlational analyses involving the TCT. \n\nFor the dialecticism score, we will use the combination of the revised Change subscale (original and added items) and the new Contradiction subscale (only added items emphasizing Tolerance of Contradictions) of the AHS.\n\nIn the Proverb Task, in addition to liking rates which previous research used (Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999), we will also use the ratings of agreement with each proverb. As liking rates can be affected by lots of other things that we cannot control, we think that agreement might provide more reliable results."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "All the analyses involving the TCT will be conducted both with the traditional scoring and binomial-linked generalized linear model (see Talhelm et al. 2015; Talhelm, 2018). \n\nThe relationship between the performance on the Triad Task and social and economic conservatism will be analyzed with separate correlations and binomial-linked GLMs. These analysis will be conducted using both the scales for social and economic conservatism and the single item political orientation scale (H1 &amp; H2).\n\nAs H2 predicts \"no relationship\", an equivalence test will be conducted for the correlation between holism measured by the Triad Task and economic conservatism.\n\nThe correlation between scores on the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS and social and economic conservatism will be examined (H3a &amp; H3b). \n\nRelationship between the CRT scores and holism measured by the Triad Task will be analyzed with correlation and binomial-linked GLM (H4a).\n\nHierarchical regression models will be tested to investigate how much of the variance in the relationship between the Triad Task scores and conservatism is accounted for by the AHS and the CRT. It is hypothesized that the variance accounted for by the CRT scores will be larger than that by the AHS scores in the relationship between the holism scores from the Triad Task and social conservatism (H4b). \n\nCorrelational analysis will be conducted between ambiguity tolerance (MSTAT-II) and dialecticism (H5).\n\nHierarchical regressions will be conducted with the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS as the outcome and the social conservatism as the predictor in the first step, and scores on the MSTAT-II as the predictor in the second step. If the relationship between the dialecticism and conservatism can be explained by ambiguity tolerance as we hypothesized, the scores on the MSTAT-II should account for a statistically significant amount of variance explained by conservatism (H6). \n\nWe will check the partial correlation between the liking rates for dialectical proverbs and scores on the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS controlling for the liking rates for non-dialectical proverbs, ratings of familiarity, poeticality, and the frequency of use (H7). If the proverb task measures dialectical thinking tendency, proverb ratings should correlate with AHS scores. If so, we will conduct the same analysis with social (H8a) and economic conservatism (H8b) as the outcome instead of AHS scores. \n\nFor the economic conservatism, two additional correlational analyses will be conducted. First, we will examine whether economic liberalism is related to collectivism as suggested above (H9). For this purpose, a correlational analysis will be conducted between economic conservatism and RISC scores. If the expected relationship is observed, we will check the partial correlation between dialecticism and economic conservatism controlling for the RISC scores (H10). \n\nThe relationship between the holistic scores on the Triad Task and social conservatism will also be analyzed separately for participants raised in urban and rural settlements. We will categorize settlements as urban and rural based on the newly included \u201chometown\u201d item which asks directly where each participant is from, as well as the hometown size question used in the first study. Hence, we will use three different criteria for urban-rural distinction: (1) Categorizing \u201cmetropolis\u201d as urban and the rest as rural based on the hometown size question, (2) population size, and (3) population density based on the open-ended hometown question relying on the data obtained from Turkish Statistical Institute (T\u00dc\u0130K). Criteria 2 and 3 will be treated as continuous moderators (H11). \n\n\nAnalyses examining the relationship between thought styles (analytic vs. holistic) and political orientation will also be conducted controlling for age, gender, childhood SES, religiosity and hometown size.

We will also conduct analyses with separate CRT and CRT-2 scores and with average scores instead of the sum (to avoid potential bias resulting from the unanswered questions), to check whether the results change.  \n\nWe will calculate the holistic thinking score by extracting the number of taxonomic pairings from the number of thematic pairings in the TCT. We will use this score in the correlational analyses involving the TCT. \n\nFor the dialecticism score, we will use the combination of the revised Change subscale (original and added items) and the new Contradiction subscale (only added items emphasizing Tolerance of Contradictions) of the AHS.\n\nIn the Proverb Task, in addition to liking rates which previous research used (Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999), we will also use the ratings of agreement with each proverb. As liking rates can be affected by lots of other things that we cannot control, we think that agreement might provide more reliable results.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "All the analyses involving the TCT will be conducted both with the traditional scoring and binomial-linked generalized linear model (see Talhelm et al. 2015; Talhelm, 2018). \n\nThe relationship between the performance on the Triad Task and social and economic conservatism will be analyzed with separate correlations and binomial-linked GLMs. These analysis will be conducted using both the scales for social and economic conservatism and the single item political orientation scale (H1 &amp; H2).\n\nAs H2 predicts \"no relationship\", an equivalence test will be conducted for the correlation between holism measured by the Triad Task and economic conservatism.\n\nThe correlation between scores on the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS and social and economic conservatism will be examined (H3a &amp; H3b). \n\nRelationship between the CRT scores and holism measured by the Triad Task will be analyzed with correlation and binomial-linked GLM (H4a).\n\nHierarchical regression models will be tested to investigate how much of the variance in the relationship between the Triad Task scores and conservatism is accounted for by the AHS and the CRT. It is hypothesized that the variance accounted for by the CRT scores will be larger than that by the AHS scores in the relationship between the holism scores from the Triad Task and social conservatism (H4b). \n\nCorrelational analysis will be conducted between ambiguity tolerance (MSTAT-II) and dialecticism (H5).\n\nHierarchical regressions will be conducted with the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS as the outcome and the social conservatism as the predictor in the first step, and scores on the MSTAT-II as the predictor in the second step. If the relationship between the dialecticism and conservatism can be explained by ambiguity tolerance as we hypothesized, the scores on the MSTAT-II should account for a statistically significant amount of variance explained by conservatism (H6). \n\nWe will check the partial correlation between the liking rates for dialectical proverbs and scores on the combined dialecticism subscale of the AHS controlling for the liking rates for non-dialectical proverbs, ratings of familiarity, poeticality, and the frequency of use (H7). If the proverb task measures dialectical thinking tendency, proverb ratings should correlate with AHS scores. If so, we will conduct the same analysis with social (H8a) and economic conservatism (H8b) as the outcome instead of AHS scores. \n\nFor the economic conservatism, two additional correlational analyses will be conducted. First, we will examine whether economic liberalism is related to collectivism as suggested above (H9). For this purpose, a correlational analysis will be conducted between economic conservatism and RISC scores. If the expected relationship is observed, we will check the partial correlation between dialecticism and economic conservatism controlling for the RISC scores (H10). \n\nThe relationship between the holistic scores on the Triad Task and social conservatism will also be analyzed separately for participants raised in urban and rural settlements. We will categorize settlements as urban and rural based on the newly included \u201chometown\u201d item which asks directly where each participant is from, as well as the hometown size question used in the first study. Hence, we will use three different criteria for urban-rural distinction: (1) Categorizing \u201cmetropolis\u201d as urban and the rest as rural based on the hometown size question, (2) population size, and (3) population density based on the open-ended hometown question relying on the data obtained from Turkish Statistical Institute (T\u00dc\u0130K). Criteria 2 and 3 will be treated as continuous moderators (H11). \n\n\nAnalyses examining the relationship between thought styles (analytic vs. holistic) and political orientation will also be conducted controlling for age, gender, childhood SES, religiosity and hometown size.

However, surprisingly little research has been dedicated to addressing how goal conflict influences support toward goal pursuit and engagement in life\u2019s opportunities (see Gere &amp; Impett, 2018 and Hui et al., 2014 for exceptions). The purpose of the current research is to address this gap in the literature. Specifically, the aim of the research is to examine whether goal conflict influences the interpersonal processes of RC support: support seeking, support providing, perceived partner responsiveness, and commitment toward opportunities. We expect that goal conflict will be negatively associated with all four core processes as partners are motivated to avoid threats to the relationship. Specifically, we expect that target\u2019s perception of goal conflict will be negatively associated with support seeking (H1; replication of research by Righetti, Kumashiro, and Campbell, 2014 using the same dataset by), perceived partner responsiveness (H2; novel), and goal commitment/motivation (H3; novel). We also expect that partner\u2019s perception of goal conflict will be negatively associated with support providing (H4). Previous research has shown that goal conflict is associated with motivation to provide, or not provide, support (Feeney et al., 2013, 2017) but has not been tested for actual support. We do not make any a priori predictions for partner effects as there is not enough prior research to be confident about specific hypotheses. However, if anything, the associations are likely to also be negative. \nFurthermore, we also extend the current literature by addressing whether individual differences in attachment styles moderate the relationship between goal conflict and the support processes. We expect that when goal conflict is high, higher levels of attachment anxiety will negatively predict perception of support (H5) as well as motivation toward goal pursuit (H6). We expect that when goal conflict is high, individuals higher (vs. lower) in attachment avoidance will seek less support (H7). Furthermore, while individuals lower (vs. higher) in attachment avoidance will be less motivated to pursue goals, those higher in attachment avoidance will be unaffected and therefore we expect this association to be positive (H8). We also expect that when partners high (vs. low) in attachment anxiety perceive goals as conflicting, they will provide less support (H9). We expect all other moderator effects to be non-significant but include them in the model as controls. Please see Table 1 for the hypotheses and Figure 2 for a graphical illustration of the proposed predictions.\nWe aim to test the hypotheses in a sample of couples who completed 8-days of daily diary data. We will use multilevel modeling with two-levels of random variation in which partners are nested within dyads and days are crossed within partners (Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006). We will include both partners\u2019 perceptions of goal conflict and both partners\u2019 attachment styles (and moderation) predicting a) support seeking, b) support providing, c) perceived responsiveness, and d) goal pursuit/movement. Furthermore, because goals can conflict with either the partner\u2019s goals or the relationship\u2019s goals, we will also test the models separately for goal conflict with partner\u2019s goals and goal conflict with relationship\u2019s goals to see whether models vary for the two outcome variables. We will also test for lagged effects by including yesterday\u2019s goal conflict to predict the next day\u2019s outcomes.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-22T10:44:18.536539", "date_modified": "2020-01-24T12:00:56.812306", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "8c7b972dd7babf3b6bb4c3487f45e92dee8dae92912e7400bcdf7fbf653a8c0522519a0d03a556aea69d068b74501ccafdb19779a9094de41e1a057946826cfbc9fb5d5224faae4b027c6960dac7e2939629e1dc7defea96ad9de9a88c1f82162076364ce73c57b034ff4afe1eaa2a07aa149c983b9fbf3a0bb5366f292fb8262a3fb68ed6603d170c4605d36b939503", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-22T10:44:18.519200", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "\nSecondary Data Analysis Preregistration\n\nTitle: Attachment Styles, Goal Conflict, and Relational Catalyst Support\n\nAuthors: Laura M.

Yes\n\nIndex/Indices \n\nNot Applicable\n\nQuestion title: Transformations\n\nWe will grand mean center predictor and moderator variables in the multilevel analyses.\n\nData Inclusion/exclusion\n\nAll participants who have complete data at Wave 3 and at least two of the daily diary entries will be included. \n\nOutliers\n\nAn outlier is any data point at Level-1 or Level-2 that is more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean. If these are encountered, we will use robustlmm package in R to estimate the multilevel models with robust estimation. \n\nWeights\n\nNot Applicable\n\nSample size\n\nThere are 139 couples who have completed wave 3. We will use all available participants.\n\nMissing data \n\nWe will use restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the models, which uses all available data to estimate intercepts and slopes.\n\nStatistical models\n\nWe will use multilevel modeling with two-levels of random variation in which partners are nested within dyads and days are crossed within partners (Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006). We will include both partners\u2019 perceptions of goal conflict (both goal conflict with partner and goal conflict with relationship) and both partners\u2019 attachment styles (and moderation) predicting a) support seeking, b) support providing, c) perceived responsiveness, and d) goal pursuit/movement. We will report the results with and without attachment styles. We will also test for lagged effects by including yesterday\u2019s goal conflict to predict the next day\u2019s outcomes in separate analyses.\n\nFollow-up analyses \n\nNo follow-up analyses\n\nInference criteria\n\nWe will run each analysis three times for each of the four outcome variables: once with only goal conflict, once with attachment also included, and once with lagged effects without attachment. Therefore, we will use a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of .004 (.05 / 12).\n\nSensitivity Analyses \n\nNot Applicable\n\nStatistical Analysis Backup Plan\n\nWe will initially run the multilevel models with random intercepts and slopes but if these do not run, we will remove random slopes from the analyses. If the partner and relationship-related goal conflict are highly correlated (above .70), we will use a combined measure of goal conflict rather than separating the two. \n\nExploratory analysis\n\nWe may address alternative explanations or potential covariates that have not been prespecified but we will report these in a separate section."}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text":

The measure contains three, factor-derived subscales: Family Participation, Family Rewards and Punishment and Friend Participation\n\nExercise self-regulation questionnaire. This questionnaire concerns the reasons why a person exercises regularly\u201a does gymnastics\u201a works out\u201a or engages in other such physical activities. It is structured so that it asks one questions and provides responses that represent external regulation\u201a introjected regulation\u201a identified regulation\u201a and intrinsic motivation. The basic issue concerns the degree to which one feels autonomous with respect to exercising or engaging in physical activity.\n\nExercise identity scale. This 9-item scale by Anderson and Cychosz (1994) will be used to assess the extent to which participants view exercise as integral to their self-concept. \n\nDepressive symptoms. The PROMIS Short Form v1.0 - Depression is an 8-item measure that assess symptoms of depression.\n\nAnxiety symptoms. The PROMIS Short Form v1.0 - Anxiety is an 8-item scale that assesses symptoms of anxiety.\n\nPerceived stress scale: This 10-item scale measures the degree to which situations in one\u2019s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives.\n\nTechnology use: Questions based on the PEW internet survey will ask participants to report the amount of time they are spending using 4 different types of technologies to connect with others. The 4 questions assess use of social media, video-chatting, text-messaging, and voice calls.\n\nValidity questions. There are three questions embedded throughout the survey to ensure that participants are not responding randomly to questions. In these questions, participants are asked to provide a specific response (e.g., Select not at all for this question). \n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "See included file for more detail:\nH1: We hypothesize that participants with greater social support will report greater physical activity competence, and greater intrinsic motivation for physical activity, which will predict greater engagement in physical activity.\n\u2022\tStructural equation modeling. Fit indices will be used to determine model fit. \n\u2022\tProposed model: Social support (time 1 and time 2) will be associated with physical activity competence (time 1 and time 2), which will be associated with intrinsic motivation for physical activity (time 1 and time 2), which will predict physical activity (3 timepoints).\nH2: We hypothesize that participants who report greater physical activity will report fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the shelter-in-place (T1 and T2) and after it is lifted (T3).\n\u2022\t3 separate mixed models: one for each DV (random intercept likely included, if AIC fit index is improved with random intercept included).\n\nH3: We will examine the extent to which greater use of technology to connect with others (e.g., social media, videochats, voice calls, texting) is associated with greater engagement in physical activity and less symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. We hypothesize that greater use of video chatting and voice calls will be more strongly and negatively associated with depression, anxiety and stress compared to social media and texting use. \n\u2022\t4 separate mixed models: one for each DV (random intercept likely included, if AIC fit index is improved with random intercept included).\n\nAim 4: We will explore whether physical activity social support mediates the relationship between technology use (social media, videochats, voice calls, texting) and physical activity.  \n\u2022\tPath Analysis: Fit indices will be used to determine model fit. \n\u2022\tProposed model: Time 1 time spent using social media, videochats, voice calls, texting (each a separate predictor) predicts time 2 physical activity social support, which predicts time 3 physical activity.\n", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e9f55cf9fd5980042568b77", "file_name": "PA study idea analytic plan 4-21-20.docx", "file_urls": {"html":

treatment of mental and psychosocial problems of college students", "description": "The college years are a developmentally crucial period for young people in which they make the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2000). Psychosocial and mental health problems during this phase of life are not only highly prevalent (Auerbach et al., 2018), but they also affect academic functioning (Bruffaerts, 2018) and can have long-term adverse outcomes in later adulthood, including persistent emotional and physical health problems, relationship dysfunction, and labor market marginalization (Scott, 2016; Kerr, 2011). Moreover, a problematic start of the professional career can have long-term negative consequences for career success and sustainability (Niederkrotenthaler, 2015; Akkermans, 2018).\nMany psychological interventions for these problems in college students have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials, and a considerable number of meta-analyses of these trials have been published. However, because the field is so large, there is no good overview of interventions and the randomized trials available for this field. \nThe goal of the current umbrella review of meta-analyses is to provide an overview of the field, including the number and quality of trials, the focus of the trials, the interventions, and the effect sizes found for the interventions in the meta-analyses.
