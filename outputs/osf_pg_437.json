Quantitative approaches have been used to identify covariation among personality disorder symptoms and have consistently recovered five maladaptive trait dimensions: Antagonism, Detachment, Disinhibition, Negative Affectivity, and Psychoticism (Krueger 2012; O\u2019Connor, 2005; Widiger &amp; Simonsen, 2005).  In contrast to viewing personality disorders as distinct, categorical entities, each trait represents a different characteristic style of impairment spanning a continuous range of possible severity.  As a testament to the paradigm shift towards dimensional trait models, one instantiation appears in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, Section III (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and a nearly identical framework has been proposed for the upcoming version of the ICD-11 (World Health Organization, 2018).  Trait models have gained traction because they not only outperform categorical personality disorder diagnoses psychometrically (Al-Dajani, Gralnick, &amp; Bagby, 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2019), they also align with what is observed clinically.\n     According to many clinical theories, all personality pathology involves impairment in capacities necessary to satisfy fundamental needs for agency and interpersonal relatedness that is expressed in different, stylistic ways (Kernberg, 1984; Livesley &amp; Jang, 2000; Pincus, 2005).  Consistent with this theoretical structure, all maladaptive traits share common pathological features which are reflected statistically in their shared variance (i.e., positive correlations).  In clinical presentation, these features are indistinguishable; thus, characterizing traits as amalgams of general and specific variance is practical for diagnostic purposes (Hopwood, 2018).  To accommodate this complexity, maladaptive traits models have been intentionally constructed to depart from a simple structure to allow interstitial symptoms (Krueger &amp; Markon, 2014). For the purposes of articulating and validating the conceptual model, however, it is necessary to clarify the nature of what is shared among traits and what is unique about them.\n     The majority of research evaluating the validity of maladaptive trait models has not statistically separated these sources of variance, so the nomological network of general and specific trait features are not well-defined.  Research looking at these components independently, using different analytic approaches, have demonstrated that general and specific factors correlate differentially with external criteria (Ringwald et al., 2019; Williams, Scalco, &amp; Simms, 2018) and have distinct developmental trajectories (Hopwood et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2015; 2016).  Other studies have shown specific variance in maladaptive traits provide unique information about outcomes measures, but without examining the complementary shared variance removed from these analyses (i.e., general personality pathology; Creswell et al., 2016; Few et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 2017).  Overall, this work supports the match between theoretical and empirical models, and has helped conceptualize the structure of personality pathology.  \n     However, studies of general and specific maladaptive trait features have primarily examined cross-sectional associations.  Cross-sectional methods are not well suited to measure the most clinically definitive aspects of personality pathology: the moment-to-moment patterns of perceiving and responding to situations, particularly interpersonal situations (Sullivan, 1953; Pincus, Hopwood, &amp; Wright, 2018).  Ambulatory assessment (AA), which entails intensive, repeated assessment of an individual over days or weeks, has been used to closely track these dynamics in near real time and with greater ecological validity compared to cross-sectional measures (Shiffman, Stone, &amp; Hufford, 2008; Trull &amp; Ebner-Priemer, 2013).  An intellectual advance enabled by AA has been measurement of temporal variability in affect, behavior, and cognitions.  Variability over time is a pattern consistent with processes of dysregulation that makeup the foundation of clinical conceptualizations of personality pathology (Trull et al., 2008). Most AA research on variability in personality pathology has focused on DSM-defined borderline personality disorder given the criterion for the diagnosis (e.g., affect lability, impulsive behavior; APA, 2013).  As expected clinically, it has been demonstrated that borderline personality disorder symptoms are associated with elevated variability in affect (Ebner-Priemer, 2007; Hepp et al., 2018; Jahng et al., 2011; Mniemne et al., 2018; Santangelo, Bohus &amp; Ebner-Priemer, 2014; Trull et al., 2008), interpersonal behaviors (Russell et al., 2007), and self-esteem (Santangelo, 2017; Zeigler-Hill &amp; Abraham, 2006).\n     Despite the value of this research for tethering nomothetic constructs to clinically relevant processes, it has almost exclusively been in relation to categorical models.  As research and clinical practice transitions to using empirically-based models, it is an open question whether and how variability fits into a dimensional trait framework.  Only three studies have used AA in the context of maladaptive traits.  In an undergraduate sample, it was found that maladaptive traits, adjusting for their shared variance, associate differentially with increased average daily interpersonal and self functioning (Roche, 2018).  Two studies have examined day-to-day variability in personality pathology symptoms and found contradictory results.   In a clinical sample, maladaptive traits were uniquely associated with more variability in daily personality disorder symptomology (Wright &amp; Simms, 2016), while in another study using an undergraduate sample, traits were associated with less variability in daily personality functioning (Roche, Jacobson, &amp; Pincus, 2016).  Both of these studies, like Roche (2018), found all traits were associated with more overall dysfunction and distress from day-to-day.  This work is a critical step towards linking maladaptive traits with pathological processes, but the daily sampling schedule is not optimal for capturing many key manifestations of personality pathology that occur at the scale of interactions within a day.\n     For instance, consider an individual who tends to view others in an extreme, all-or-nothing manner.  During one interaction with her romantic partner, she is intensely affectionate and subservient. Later in the day, she perceives rejection in her partners\u2019 benign side remark and angrily lashes out at him.  Or consider another individual with self-esteem contingent others\u2019 views of him such that he fluctuates between feeling grandiose and defensively hostile depending on the perceived admiration of others around him at any given moment.  In clinical theories, these dynamics are explained in terms of insecure attachments (Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2004), cognitive distortions (Beck, Davis, &amp; Freeman, 2014), maladaptive schemas (Young, 1994), or unintegrated object representations (Clarkin, Yeomans, &amp; Kernberg, 1999), and are central to a conceptual, mechanistic model of personality pathology.\n     Our previous work is the first to our knowledge to investigate momentary dynamics in relation to maladaptive traits (OSF: https://osf.io/bnsug/).  In a pre-registered replication using two adult samples, we examined associations between maladaptive traits and AA-derived estimates of average positive and negative affect, interpersonal behavior, and perception of others\u2019 behavior across interactions, as well as variability in each of these outcomes.  Interpersonal behavior of self and others was operationalized by dimensions of affiliation (i.e., warm to cold) and dominance (i.e., dominant to submissive). In addition to zero-order associations, we also looked at associations with shared and unique trait variance to distinguish general and specific interpersonal patterns.  We found that general personality pathology (i.e. shared variance between maladaptive traits) and trait style (i.e., trait variance adjusted for covariance with other traits) had theoretically-consistent associations with interpersonal variables.  General personality pathology was characterized by having more distressing and less positive, affiliative interactions overall, as well as more variability in dominant behavior, perceived dominance, and negative affect.  Specific trait styles were associated differentially to average momentary affects and behaviors, but less so to variability.  Taken together, this study showed the structural independence of general and specific features and reinforced their validity for predicting functioning in everyday life.\n     The current study will replicate and extend our previous work in two, important ways.  We will use two samples representing a range of personality functioning needed to properly test a dimensional trait model, but are also enriched with personality pathology to promote generalizability to clinical populations (Stanton et al., 2020).  In addition to sample composition, this study will build on our previous study by measuring traits with two different instruments (i.e., Personality Inventory for DSM-5 [PID-5; Krueger et al., 2012], Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder Static Form [CAT-PD-SF; Simms et al., 2011]) to provide convergent validity between methods.\n     To establish an overall clinical picture of each trait, and to provide a basis of comparison for multivariate models, we will examine zero-order associations between traits and each of the momentary variables.  Then, to clarify which features reflect general personality pathology and which are indicative of specific style, we will look at associations with all trait\u2019s shared and unique variance.  By connecting momentary interpersonal patterns with total, shared, and unique variance in maladaptive traits we will provide several vantage points to evaluate a general and specific model of personality pathology.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses are informed by previous work in non-clinical samples and theoretical considerations.

Thus, the sampling approach and some of the measures used are not relevant to the current analysis so are not described in great detail here. \n\nSample 1 (S1)\n     311 community members were recruited through posted flyers for a study of personality, daily stress, and social interactions.  For inclusion, participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 40 and were not currently receiving treatment for psychosis or a psychotic disorder.\nPreliminary screening was used to recruit a gender-balanced sample and to ensure adequate representation of a range of personality pathology and interpersonal problems.  The sample was also selected to balance individuals who had received recent mental health treatment within the past year with those who had not.  Individuals were pre-screened using items from the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Morse &amp; Pilkonis, 2007) and were recruited in an approximately 1-1-1 representation of low, moderate, and high levels of interpersonal difficulties within gender, treatment status, and the overall sample.  See Figure 1 for a graphical representation of this recruitment strategy.\n     Participation in this study involved completing a battery of baseline assessments in one laboratory session followed by an AA protocol.  All participants received $50 for the baseline session.  Those who answered 90% or greater of the surveys during the AA protocol earned an additional $110 (14-day ambulatory assessment) or $160 (21-day ambulatory assessment).  This amount was prorated by week for those who completed less than 90% of the surveys overall, with surveys completed in later weeks of the study valued higher in the prorated compensation model.  Final payment was contingent upon return of the Fitbit Blaze (and, if applicable, the laboratory-owned smartphone). Additionally, for each 100 participants, a drawing was conducted for an iPad Mini.  Chances of winning increased with the number of surveys answered. \n     During the baseline portion of the study, participants completed a clinical interview and a battery of self-report measures.  Only self-report measures from the baseline assessment will be used for this study.  Following the assessment battery, participants were provided instruction from a research assistant regarding the AA procedures and the required smartphone applications were installed on their phone. For this study, only data collected through the MetricWire application will be used.  Most participants used their own Android or iOS smartphone for completing the AA surveys, however a limited number of laboratory-owned Android smartphones were available for individuals without compatible devices.\nAAs typically began the day after the baseline assessment.  The length of assessment period was initially set at 21 days but was later shortened to 14 days.  Surveys were administered through the MetricWire smartphone application.  The AA protocol included surveys at the beginning and end of day as well as random prompt surveys.  A subset of participants received experimental micro surveys, and some participants had an application installed on their smartphones that collected sensor data.  For this study, only data from the random prompts will be used, so the other components of the protocol will not be described further.\nRandomly-initiated survey prompts were received through push notifications sent by the MetricWire application.  Six surveys were delivered per day within an approximately 12-hour time window corresponding to the participants\u2019 waking hours.  Blocked random intervals were set so that a minimum of 90 minutes passed between surveys and participants were given 20 minutes to respond to each one.  Each participant completed an average of 68.6 (SD = 20.92) of these surveys.\n     At each random prompt, participants were asked whether or not three types of significant events had occurred since the previous survey: stressful, unpleasant, and pleasant.  For each event indicated, participants answered a series of questions including whether any interpersonal interaction was involved.  Thus, 0-3 events could be reported on during each survey.  If any type of event did not occur, the survey ended.  In this study, we will only use responses to surveys including an interaction.  Each event reported per survey will be considered a separate interaction.  \n     Interactions were defined as real-time, direct conversations between the participant and one or more other individuals that last for at least five minutes.  These could include in-person, voice, video, and text-based conversations.  For each interaction, participants reported on their own affects and behaviors, and the behaviors of the person they interacted with.  If part of a group interaction, participants were instructed to report on how others behaved on average.  \n\nSample 2 (S2)\n     This sample consists of a case-control subsample of participants drawn from a longitudinal study examining suicidal behavior in relation to borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Participants for the study were recruited from inpatient and outpatient clinics as well as from the surrounding community by advertisement.  For inclusion, participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 45.  Exclusion criteria included lifetime diagnosis of any psychotic or bipolar disorder, clinical evidence of organic brain disease, physical disorders or treatments with known psychiatric consequence (e.g., lupus, steroids), or an IQ &lt; 70 confirmed by assessment in the study.\n     The subsample used for the current study (N = 197) participated in an AA protocol, and were selected to represent the four groups identified in the overall sample (described below).  The majority of participants in the subsample meet diagnostic criteria for BPD.  The diagnosis of BPD was determined by standardized semi-structured diagnostic interviews (International Personality Disorders Examination [IPDE; Loranger, 1994] and the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines-revised [Zanarini et al., 1989]) conducted by masters-level research clinicians.  Diagnoses were confirmed in a consensus conference by raters and two research psychiatrists using all available data, including medical records where available.  All clinical interviews were completed during a baseline assessment.  \n     Each participant diagnosed with BPD was further stratified into three groups based on the lethality of reported suicide attempts.  Attempters were defined by a score &gt; 1 (n = 107) on the Beck Lethality Scale, high-lethality attempters by a score &gt;3 (n = 52), and the remaining were non-attempters (n = 67). The control group (n = 75) were required to have no lifetime Axis I or II diagnoses determined on the IPDE or Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, respectively.  \nSelf-reported maladaptive traits were added to the protocol in 2017.  Thus, for some participants in the sub-sample used in this study, traits were assessed at baseline.  For others who had been participating in the study longer, maladaptive traits were assessed at a follow-up visit.\n     All participants in the subsample completed a 21-day AA protocol using a smartphone provided by the study.  The protocol included beginning and end of day assessments, random surveys, and micro surveys.  Only data from the random surveys will be used for this study.  Like S2, six random prompt surveys were delivered each day by push notifications from the MetricWire application.  In each of these surveys, participants indicated whether or not an interaction lasting at least ten minutes had occurred.  When an interaction was reported, participants rated their own affects and behaviors, and the behaviors of the person they interacted with.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "S1_Sampling.docx"}, "nodeId": "5phwv", "sha256": "a459fb59a055c5c43ec0a5233bddf98d95ba167c203191b7126814c9c513bcf7", "viewUrl": "/project/mdu6z/files/osfstorage/5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f2/", "selectedFileName": "S1_Sampling.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Consistent with a dimensional model, all participants regardless of diagnostic status or level of pathology will be considered in our analyses.

The adjectives Happy, Excited, and Content were used to measured PA, and NA was measured using the adjectives Angry, Nervous, Sad, and Irritated.

This enables the residual coefficients to vary between individuals (i.e., individual differences in level of variability) and become outcomes at the between-person level (i.e., to examine trait predictors of variability).  Residuals can be interpreted as the individual\u2019s variability around their own mean over time and individual differences in the random intercept reflect person-specific averages.  \n\n     First, we will examine associations with total trait variance and each of the outcome variables in a series of zero-order models.  One momentary variable at a time will be regressed on each trait entered separately as a between-person predictor.  To evaluate unique associations, we will regress each momentary variable on all traits simultaneously at the between-person level.  Finally, we will estimate a latent variable from the shared variance among all traits at the between-person level.  Each momentary variable will then be regressed on this latent variable, reflecting general personality pathology.\n\n     Bayesian estimation will be used because it allows modeling of heterogeneity in residual variances of outcome variables at the within-person level.  No prior information about parameter values will be specified (i.e., we used non-informative/diffuse priors that are the default in Mplus).\n\n     To account for potential effects of time trends on behavior and affect, which could affect individual differences in variance, the effect of outcome variables (i.e., interpersonal behavior and affect) regressed on day of week and study day will be included at the within-person level. These effects will be estimated as random. By detrending the data in this way, the residual variances can be more readily interpreted as \u201ctrue\u201d variability rather than normative shifts in behavior and affect such as a spike in positive emotions over the weekend.  Due to concerns about the dependency of variable means and variability (Baird et al., 2006), we will adjust for their association by regressing within-person residual variance of the outcome variables on the person-specific mean of the same outcome variable. \n\nReplication Evaluation\nTo evaluate the extent to which effects replicated across samples, we will interpret overlapping 95% credibility intervals. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "As noted above, within-person assessed variables will be decomposed into within and between-person variance components.

Ringwald, Aidan G.C. Wright, Alexandre Dombrovski, Michael Hallquist", "q3": "     Shortcomings of categorical personality disorder diagnoses have launched efforts to develop empirical models that better reflect individual differences in personality functioning.  Quantitative approaches have been used to identify covariation among personality disorder symptoms and have consistently recovered five maladaptive trait dimensions: Antagonism, Detachment, Disinhibition, Negative Affectivity, and Psychoticism (Krueger 2012; O\u2019Connor, 2005; Widiger &amp; Simonsen, 2005).  In contrast to viewing personality disorders as distinct, categorical entities, each trait represents a different characteristic style of impairment spanning a continuous range of possible severity.  As a testament to the paradigm shift towards dimensional trait models, one instantiation appears in the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, Section III (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and a nearly identical framework has been proposed for the upcoming version of the ICD-11 (World Health Organization, 2018).  Trait models have gained traction because they not only outperform categorical personality disorder diagnoses psychometrically (Al-Dajani, Gralnick, &amp; Bagby, 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2019), they also align with what is observed clinically.\n     According to many clinical theories, all personality pathology involves impairment in capacities necessary to satisfy fundamental needs for agency and interpersonal relatedness that is expressed in different, stylistic ways (Kernberg, 1984; Livesley &amp; Jang, 2000; Pincus, 2005).  Consistent with this theoretical structure, all maladaptive traits share common pathological features which are reflected statistically in their shared variance (i.e., positive correlations).  In clinical presentation, these features are indistinguishable; thus, characterizing traits as amalgams of general and specific variance is practical for diagnostic purposes (Hopwood, 2018).  To accommodate this complexity, maladaptive traits models have been intentionally constructed to depart from a simple structure to allow interstitial symptoms (Krueger &amp; Markon, 2014). For the purposes of articulating and validating the conceptual model, however, it is necessary to clarify the nature of what is shared among traits and what is unique about them.\n     The majority of research evaluating the validity of maladaptive trait models has not statistically separated these sources of variance, so the nomological network of general and specific trait features are not well-defined.  Research looking at these components independently, using different analytic approaches, have demonstrated that general and specific factors correlate differentially with external criteria (Ringwald et al., 2019; Williams, Scalco, &amp; Simms, 2018) and have distinct developmental trajectories (Hopwood et al., 2011; Wright et al., 2015; 2016).  Other studies have shown specific variance in maladaptive traits provide unique information about outcomes measures, but without examining the complementary shared variance removed from these analyses (i.e., general personality pathology; Creswell et al., 2016; Few et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 2017).  Overall, this work supports the match between theoretical and empirical models, and has helped conceptualize the structure of personality pathology.  \n     However, studies of general and specific maladaptive trait features have primarily examined cross-sectional associations.  Cross-sectional methods are not well suited to measure the most clinically definitive aspects of personality pathology: the moment-to-moment patterns of perceiving and responding to situations, particularly interpersonal situations (Sullivan, 1953; Pincus, Hopwood, &amp; Wright, 2018).  Ambulatory assessment (AA), which entails intensive, repeated assessment of an individual over days or weeks, has been used to closely track these dynamics in near real time and with greater ecological validity compared to cross-sectional measures (Shiffman, Stone, &amp; Hufford, 2008; Trull &amp; Ebner-Priemer, 2013).  An intellectual advance enabled by AA has been measurement of temporal variability in affect, behavior, and cognitions.  Variability over time is a pattern consistent with processes of dysregulation that makeup the foundation of clinical conceptualizations of personality pathology (Trull et al., 2008). Most AA research on variability in personality pathology has focused on DSM-defined borderline personality disorder given the criterion for the diagnosis (e.g., affect lability, impulsive behavior; APA, 2013).  As expected clinically, it has been demonstrated that borderline personality disorder symptoms are associated with elevated variability in affect (Ebner-Priemer, 2007; Hepp et al., 2018; Jahng et al., 2011; Mniemne et al., 2018; Santangelo, Bohus &amp; Ebner-Priemer, 2014; Trull et al., 2008), interpersonal behaviors (Russell et al., 2007), and self-esteem (Santangelo, 2017; Zeigler-Hill &amp; Abraham, 2006).\n     Despite the value of this research for tethering nomothetic constructs to clinically relevant processes, it has almost exclusively been in relation to categorical models.  As research and clinical practice transitions to using empirically-based models, it is an open question whether and how variability fits into a dimensional trait framework.  Only three studies have used AA in the context of maladaptive traits.  In an undergraduate sample, it was found that maladaptive traits, adjusting for their shared variance, associate differentially with increased average daily interpersonal and self functioning (Roche, 2018).  Two studies have examined day-to-day variability in personality pathology symptoms and found contradictory results.   In a clinical sample, maladaptive traits were uniquely associated with more variability in daily personality disorder symptomology (Wright &amp; Simms, 2016), while in another study using an undergraduate sample, traits were associated with less variability in daily personality functioning (Roche, Jacobson, &amp; Pincus, 2016).  Both of these studies, like Roche (2018), found all traits were associated with more overall dysfunction and distress from day-to-day.  This work is a critical step towards linking maladaptive traits with pathological processes, but the daily sampling schedule is not optimal for capturing many key manifestations of personality pathology that occur at the scale of interactions within a day.\n     For instance, consider an individual who tends to view others in an extreme, all-or-nothing manner.  During one interaction with her romantic partner, she is intensely affectionate and subservient. Later in the day, she perceives rejection in her partners\u2019 benign side remark and angrily lashes out at him.  Or consider another individual with self-esteem contingent others\u2019 views of him such that he fluctuates between feeling grandiose and defensively hostile depending on the perceived admiration of others around him at any given moment.  In clinical theories, these dynamics are explained in terms of insecure attachments (Bateman &amp; Fonagy, 2004), cognitive distortions (Beck, Davis, &amp; Freeman, 2014), maladaptive schemas (Young, 1994), or unintegrated object representations (Clarkin, Yeomans, &amp; Kernberg, 1999), and are central to a conceptual, mechanistic model of personality pathology.\n     Our previous work is the first to our knowledge to investigate momentary dynamics in relation to maladaptive traits (OSF: https://osf.io/bnsug/).  In a pre-registered replication using two adult samples, we examined associations between maladaptive traits and AA-derived estimates of average positive and negative affect, interpersonal behavior, and perception of others\u2019 behavior across interactions, as well as variability in each of these outcomes.  Interpersonal behavior of self and others was operationalized by dimensions of affiliation (i.e., warm to cold) and dominance (i.e., dominant to submissive). In addition to zero-order associations, we also looked at associations with shared and unique trait variance to distinguish general and specific interpersonal patterns.  We found that general personality pathology (i.e. shared variance between maladaptive traits) and trait style (i.e., trait variance adjusted for covariance with other traits) had theoretically-consistent associations with interpersonal variables.  General personality pathology was characterized by having more distressing and less positive, affiliative interactions overall, as well as more variability in dominant behavior, perceived dominance, and negative affect.  Specific trait styles were associated differentially to average momentary affects and behaviors, but less so to variability.  Taken together, this study showed the structural independence of general and specific features and reinforced their validity for predicting functioning in everyday life.\n     The current study will replicate and extend our previous work in two, important ways.  We will use two samples representing a range of personality functioning needed to properly test a dimensional trait model, but are also enriched with personality pathology to promote generalizability to clinical populations (Stanton et al., 2020).  In addition to sample composition, this study will build on our previous study by measuring traits with two different instruments (i.e., Personality Inventory for DSM-5 [PID-5; Krueger et al., 2012], Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder Static Form [CAT-PD-SF; Simms et al., 2011]) to provide convergent validity between methods.\n     To establish an overall clinical picture of each trait, and to provide a basis of comparison for multivariate models, we will examine zero-order associations between traits and each of the momentary variables.  Then, to clarify which features reflect general personality pathology and which are indicative of specific style, we will look at associations with all trait\u2019s shared and unique variance.  By connecting momentary interpersonal patterns with total, shared, and unique variance in maladaptive traits we will provide several vantage points to evaluate a general and specific model of personality pathology.\n", "q4": "Hypotheses are informed by previous work in non-clinical samples and theoretical considerations.

In S2, participants completed six, randomly-initiated surveys per day delivered via a smartphone application for a total of 21 days.", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "The data that will be used were not collected for the purpose of this specific study but are derived from two broader studies.  Thus, the sampling approach and some of the measures used are not relevant to the current analysis so are not described in great detail here. \n\nSample 1 (S1)\n     311 community members were recruited through posted flyers for a study of personality, daily stress, and social interactions.  For inclusion, participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 40 and were not currently receiving treatment for psychosis or a psychotic disorder.\nPreliminary screening was used to recruit a gender-balanced sample and to ensure adequate representation of a range of personality pathology and interpersonal problems.  The sample was also selected to balance individuals who had received recent mental health treatment within the past year with those who had not.  Individuals were pre-screened using items from the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Morse &amp; Pilkonis, 2007) and were recruited in an approximately 1-1-1 representation of low, moderate, and high levels of interpersonal difficulties within gender, treatment status, and the overall sample.  See Figure 1 for a graphical representation of this recruitment strategy.\n     Participation in this study involved completing a battery of baseline assessments in one laboratory session followed by an AA protocol.  All participants received $50 for the baseline session.  Those who answered 90% or greater of the surveys during the AA protocol earned an additional $110 (14-day ambulatory assessment) or $160 (21-day ambulatory assessment).  This amount was prorated by week for those who completed less than 90% of the surveys overall, with surveys completed in later weeks of the study valued higher in the prorated compensation model.  Final payment was contingent upon return of the Fitbit Blaze (and, if applicable, the laboratory-owned smartphone). Additionally, for each 100 participants, a drawing was conducted for an iPad Mini.  Chances of winning increased with the number of surveys answered. \n     During the baseline portion of the study, participants completed a clinical interview and a battery of self-report measures.  Only self-report measures from the baseline assessment will be used for this study.  Following the assessment battery, participants were provided instruction from a research assistant regarding the AA procedures and the required smartphone applications were installed on their phone. For this study, only data collected through the MetricWire application will be used.  Most participants used their own Android or iOS smartphone for completing the AA surveys, however a limited number of laboratory-owned Android smartphones were available for individuals without compatible devices.\nAAs typically began the day after the baseline assessment.  The length of assessment period was initially set at 21 days but was later shortened to 14 days.  Surveys were administered through the MetricWire smartphone application.  The AA protocol included surveys at the beginning and end of day as well as random prompt surveys.  A subset of participants received experimental micro surveys, and some participants had an application installed on their smartphones that collected sensor data.  For this study, only data from the random prompts will be used, so the other components of the protocol will not be described further.\nRandomly-initiated survey prompts were received through push notifications sent by the MetricWire application.  Six surveys were delivered per day within an approximately 12-hour time window corresponding to the participants\u2019 waking hours.  Blocked random intervals were set so that a minimum of 90 minutes passed between surveys and participants were given 20 minutes to respond to each one.  Each participant completed an average of 68.6 (SD = 20.92) of these surveys.\n     At each random prompt, participants were asked whether or not three types of significant events had occurred since the previous survey: stressful, unpleasant, and pleasant.  For each event indicated, participants answered a series of questions including whether any interpersonal interaction was involved.  Thus, 0-3 events could be reported on during each survey.  If any type of event did not occur, the survey ended.  In this study, we will only use responses to surveys including an interaction.  Each event reported per survey will be considered a separate interaction.  \n     Interactions were defined as real-time, direct conversations between the participant and one or more other individuals that last for at least five minutes.  These could include in-person, voice, video, and text-based conversations.  For each interaction, participants reported on their own affects and behaviors, and the behaviors of the person they interacted with.  If part of a group interaction, participants were instructed to report on how others behaved on average.  \n\nSample 2 (S2)\n     This sample consists of a case-control subsample of participants drawn from a longitudinal study examining suicidal behavior in relation to borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Participants for the study were recruited from inpatient and outpatient clinics as well as from the surrounding community by advertisement.  For inclusion, participants had to be between the ages of 18 and 45.  Exclusion criteria included lifetime diagnosis of any psychotic or bipolar disorder, clinical evidence of organic brain disease, physical disorders or treatments with known psychiatric consequence (e.g., lupus, steroids), or an IQ &lt; 70 confirmed by assessment in the study.\n     The subsample used for the current study (N = 197) participated in an AA protocol, and were selected to represent the four groups identified in the overall sample (described below).  The majority of participants in the subsample meet diagnostic criteria for BPD.  The diagnosis of BPD was determined by standardized semi-structured diagnostic interviews (International Personality Disorders Examination [IPDE; Loranger, 1994] and the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines-revised [Zanarini et al., 1989]) conducted by masters-level research clinicians.  Diagnoses were confirmed in a consensus conference by raters and two research psychiatrists using all available data, including medical records where available.  All clinical interviews were completed during a baseline assessment.  \n     Each participant diagnosed with BPD was further stratified into three groups based on the lethality of reported suicide attempts.  Attempters were defined by a score &gt; 1 (n = 107) on the Beck Lethality Scale, high-lethality attempters by a score &gt;3 (n = 52), and the remaining were non-attempters (n = 67). The control group (n = 75) were required to have no lifetime Axis I or II diagnoses determined on the IPDE or Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, respectively.  \nSelf-reported maladaptive traits were added to the protocol in 2017.  Thus, for some participants in the sub-sample used in this study, traits were assessed at baseline.  For others who had been participating in the study longer, maladaptive traits were assessed at a follow-up visit.\n     All participants in the subsample completed a 21-day AA protocol using a smartphone provided by the study.  The protocol included beginning and end of day assessments, random surveys, and micro surveys.  Only data from the random surveys will be used for this study.  Like S2, six random prompt surveys were delivered each day by push notifications from the MetricWire application.  In each of these surveys, participants indicated whether or not an interaction lasting at least ten minutes had occurred.  When an interaction was reported, participants rated their own affects and behaviors, and the behaviors of the person they interacted with.\n", "q12.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f2", "file_name": "S1_Sampling.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/mdu6z/files/osfstorage/5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f2", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f2"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "a459fb59a055c5c43ec0a5233bddf98d95ba167c203191b7126814c9c513bcf7"}}], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Maladaptive traits\n     In S1, the Computerized Adaptive Test of Personality Disorder \u2013 Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms, 2013) was used to assess maladaptive traits.  The CAT-PD-SF is a self-report measure consisting of 216 items derived from the larger CAT-PD item pool (Simms et al., 2011).  Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 \u2013 Very Untrue of Me; 1 \u2013 Moderately Untrue of Me; 2 \u2013 Neither True nor Untrue of Me; 3 \u2013 Moderately True of Me; 4 \u2013 Very True of Me).  The CAT-PD-SF can be used to calculate 33 maladaptive traits: Affective Lability, Anger, Anhedonia, Anxiousness, Callousness, Cognitive Problems, Depressiveness, Domineering, Emotional Detachment, Exhibitionism, Fantasy Proneness, Grandiosity, Health Anxiety, Hostile Aggression, Irresponsibility, Manipulativeness, Mistrust, Non-Perseverance, Non-Planfulness, Norm Violation, Peculiarity, Perfectionism, Relationship Insecurity, Rigidity, Risk Taking, Romantic Disinterest, Rudeness, Self-Harm, Social Withdrawal, Submissiveness, Unusual Beliefs, Unusual Experiences, Workaholism.   \n     In S2, maladaptive traits were assessed using The Personality Inventory for the DSM-5 provided by the American Psychiatric Association (Krueger et al., 2012).  It is comprised of 220 items rated on a four-point Likert scale (0\u2014Very False/ Often False; 1 \u2013 Sometimes/ Somewhat False; 2\u2014Sometimes/ Somewhat True; 3\u2014Very True or Often True).  Items are used to generate dimensional scores for 25 narrow trait facets. Corresponding facets (3 per trait) can then be averaged to assess broader trait domains of Negative Affect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism (see Table 1).\n\nMomentary affect\n     In both samples, momentary affect was measured using emotion adjectives derived from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988).  In the S1 AA protocol, participants rated their affect during stressful, unpleasant, and pleasant events involving interpersonal interactions (e.g., \u201cHow ADJECTIVE did you feel during this [stressful] event?\u201d).  The adjectives Confident and Happy were used for positive affect (PA) and Angry, Nervous, and Sad were used for negative affect (NA).  Affect was indicated on a slider scale from 0 (Not at All) to 100 (Extremely) for each adjective.\n     In S2 participants, participants rated their affect during interactions (i.e., \u201cHow ADJECTIVE did you feel during this interaction?\u201d).  The adjectives Happy, Excited, and Content were used to measured PA, and NA was measured using the adjectives Angry, Nervous, Sad, and Irritated.  In this sample, affect was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 \u2013 Very Slightly or Not at all, 2 \u2013 A Little; 3 \u2013 Moderately; 4 \u2013 Quite a Bit; 5 \u2013 A great deal).\n\nMomentary interpersonal behavior/ perception of others\u2019 behavior\n     Interpersonal behavior was measured identically in both samples.  Participants were prompted to \u201cPlease rate how the OTHER PERSON BEHAVED toward you during the interaction\u201d and \u201cPlease rate YOUR BEHAVIOR toward the other person during the interaction.\u201d  For both self and other, Dominance (\u201cAccommodating/ Submissive/ Timid\u201d to \u201cAssertive/ Dominant/ Controlling\u201d) and Affiliation (\u201cCold/ Distant/Hostile\u201d to \u201cWarm/ Friendly/ Caring\u201d) were rated on 101-point slider scales (-50 to +50).\n\nCovariates\n     Age and gender of participants will be included as covariates at the between-person level in all analyses.\n     Day of week and number of hours in study will be included as covariates at the within-person level in all analyses.  Day of week is dummy coded such that 1=weekend (Saturday, Sunday) and 0=weekday.  Day of study is centered at the average mid-point of the respective study.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "Maladaptive traits\n     In the PID-5, trait facet scales are averaged to produce the five trait domain scores.  The CAT-PD-SF, on the other hand, was designed to measure 33 narrow traits rather than the five broader domains of interest to this study.  To calculate trait domain-level scores, and to remain consistent across samples, CAT-PD-SF scales that are conceptually comparable to PID-5 facet scales will used to assess the five maladaptive traits.  \n     For most PID-5 facets there was a clear corollary in the CAT-PD-SF.  The only exception is for calculating Antagonism, there is not a distinct Deceitfulness scale in the CAT-PD-SF. We will calculate Antagonism with the CAT-PD-SF two ways: 1. Using only the two scales that directly relate to the PID-5 scales (Manipulativeness and Grandiosity) and 2. Using Exhibitionism along with the other two Antagonism scales. \n     The corresponding scales used to calculate each trait are shown in Table 1.  For the CAT-PD-SF, there are six items per trait scale and for the PID-5 there are eight items per facet scale.  Scales are calculated by taking the average of the corresponding items in both instruments.  Then, the three corresponding traits (for the CAT-PD-SF) or facets (PID-5), shown in Table 1, are averaged to produce a score for each of the five maladaptive traits we will use as predictors in our analyses. \n\nMomentary affect\n     Variables from the AA assessments will be indexed using multi-level structural equation modeling (MSEM) which will be mentioned here and described in greater detail in the analysis plan.\n     Prior to MSEM, in both samples, adjectives corresponding to PA/NA for each survey will be averaged to produce a single, occasion-level (i.e., interaction) score for each.  Each individual\u2019s average affect across interactions will be estimated using random intercepts for PA/NA.     Variability in affect across interactions will be estimated as the residual, within-person variance for PA/NA.\n\nMomentary interpersonal behavior/perception of others\u2019 behaviors\n     Like affect, in both samples, average affiliative and dominant behavior of self and other across interactions will be estimated using random intercepts and within-person residual variance will be used to estimate variability in interpersonal behavior and perception.\n", "q18.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f0", "file_name": "Table 1.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/mdu6z/files/osfstorage/5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f0", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3b624f032a4d0098e759f0"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "6bc1e7a62c6f2a897a9eb9fcd83d96cc46e3ca6605219253773af9cc9f16bf2e"}}], "q19.question": "Main Analyses\n\nAll MSEM models will be conducted in Mplus Version 8.4 (2019).  Syntax for models are provided on the OSF page for this study.\n\n     Using this method, total variance in the observed measures of interpersonal behavior, perception, and affect was decomposed into within- and between-person latent variables.  In MSEM, both outcomes and predictors have both within- and between-person variance.  In addition, within-person (i.e., Level 1) residuals were modeled as heterogenous across individuals (i.e., Level 2 units).  This enables the residual coefficients to vary between individuals (i.e., individual differences in level of variability) and become outcomes at the between-person level (i.e., to examine trait predictors of variability).  Residuals can be interpreted as the individual\u2019s variability around their own mean over time and individual differences in the random intercept reflect person-specific averages.  \n\n     First, we will examine associations with total trait variance and each of the outcome variables in a series of zero-order models.  One momentary variable at a time will be regressed on each trait entered separately as a between-person predictor.  To evaluate unique associations, we will regress each momentary variable on all traits simultaneously at the between-person level.  Finally, we will estimate a latent variable from the shared variance among all traits at the between-person level.  Each momentary variable will then be regressed on this latent variable, reflecting general personality pathology.\n\n     Bayesian estimation will be used because it allows modeling of heterogeneity in residual variances of outcome variables at the within-person level.  No prior information about parameter values will be specified (i.e., we used non-informative/diffuse priors that are the default in Mplus).\n\n     To account for potential effects of time trends on behavior and affect, which could affect individual differences in variance, the effect of outcome variables (i.e., interpersonal behavior and affect) regressed on day of week and study day will be included at the within-person level. These effects will be estimated as random. By detrending the data in this way, the residual variances can be more readily interpreted as \u201ctrue\u201d variability rather than normative shifts in behavior and affect such as a spike in positive emotions over the weekend.  Due to concerns about the dependency of variable means and variability (Baird et al., 2006), we will adjust for their association by regressing within-person residual variance of the outcome variables on the person-specific mean of the same outcome variable. \n\nReplication Evaluation\nTo evaluate the extent to which effects replicated across samples, we will interpret overlapping 95% credibility intervals. \n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/mdu6z/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},

This covert recruiting method will be used to avoid demand characteristics of the experimental situation (Boot, Blakely &amp; Simons, 2011). [A second video game questionnaire will be administered after participation to confirm VG-playing status.]\nIn line with the Bavelier lab\u2019s current protocol (https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/vgq/, November 2019), to qualify as a VGP a participant will need to report a minimum of 5 hours per week of action game play during the past year. Criterion for inclusion in the NVGP group will be a report of no more than 1 hour per week of action game play, no more than 3 hours per week of other game play and less than 5 hours per week when all game genres are summed during the past year.\n\nParticipants must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no skin sensitivities to participate. All those who participate will be compensated with course credit.\nMost prior related research has focused exclusively on male participants because of the relative scarcity of female VGPs. However, our existing pool (as assessed via the VG questionnaire from the Psychology Data Bank) includes very few males who qualify as NVGPs. This is largely driven by the relatively low number of males in psychology programmes. Due to the large number of females in our psychology programmes, we actually have a reasonably substantial pool of female VGPs, and thus we intend to recruit both male and female VGPs and NVGPs with the number of males/females in each group roughly matched. We do not expect gender to be a factor in VG enhancement because, upon training both males and females on action VGs, there were no differences in the improvements seen between the genders (Feng, Spence, &amp; Pratt, 2007). Further, other work assessing VG improvements found no differences between pre-existing male and female gamers (Cain, Landau, &amp; Shimamura, 2012; Appelbaum et al., 2013).\n\nReferences\n\nAppelbaum, L.

EEG activity from parietal-occipital sites on the left (PO3, P3, P5) and right (PO4, P4, P6) sides of the head will be used to calculate N2pc difference waves: the difference between the activity in posterior electrodes contralateral minus those ipsilateral to the relevant popout target stimulus. Latencies of the N2pc component will be analysed using both peak latency measures and onset latency measures. To capture the onset latency we will calculate the fractional peak latency: the time at which the ERP waveform reached 50% of its peak amplitude. Mean amplitude measures of the N2pc will be taken in a 40 ms latency window around the peak of the N2pc observed. \nCDA amplitude.

The LRP component will be calculated time-locked to both the stimulus array and behavioural response. For both cases, the activity will be calculated as the voltage difference between electrodes over the motor cortices contralateral versus ipsilateral to the hand used to execute the response on each trial resulting in LRP difference waves. Latencies will be analysed using both peak latency measures and onset latency measures (see above for calculation). The amplitudes of the LRP components will be assessed in a 40 ms window around the grand-averaged peak observed in the session.

Latham and colleagues (2013) suggest that the shorter N1 latencies found in VGP\u2019s may enable them to discriminate attended visual stimuli earlier than NVGP\u2019s. Other evidence also alludes to a general enhancement of basic sensory processing in VGP\u2019s. We will therefore further explore differences in the peak latencies and peak amplitude of the N1 component between VGP\u2019s and NVGP\u2019s. \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that VGP\u2019s differ in the way they deploy visual attention to central and peripheral targets compared to NVGP\u2019s. Compared to NVGP\u2019s, VGP\u2019s produced a larger N2pc negativity in response to a target stimulus, although this difference was dependent on the target being near to the fixation point (West et al., 2015). It is therefore in our interest to further investigate differences in amplitude of the N2pc component between VGP\u2019s and NVGP\u2019s.\n\nThe SPCN/CDA component has been linked to maintenance and manipulation of information in visual working memory. Previous research suggests that the amplitude of this component becomes smaller as the search task becomes less cognitively demanding (Emrich et al., 2009; Luria &amp; Vogel, 2011), which may be relevant to VGP\u2019s who often engage in target-discrimination processes during gameplay.

Latham and colleagues (2013) suggest that the shorter N1 latencies found in VGP\u2019s may enable them to discriminate attended visual stimuli earlier than NVGP\u2019s. Other evidence also alludes to a general enhancement of basic sensory processing in VGP\u2019s. We will therefore further explore differences in the peak latencies and peak amplitude of the N1 component between VGP\u2019s and NVGP\u2019s. \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that VGP\u2019s differ in the way they deploy visual attention to central and peripheral targets compared to NVGP\u2019s. Compared to NVGP\u2019s, VGP\u2019s produced a larger N2pc negativity in response to a target stimulus, although this difference was dependent on the target being near to the fixation point (West et al., 2015). It is therefore in our interest to further investigate differences in amplitude of the N2pc component between VGP\u2019s and NVGP\u2019s.\n\nThe SPCN/CDA component has been linked to maintenance and manipulation of information in visual working memory. Previous research suggests that the amplitude of this component becomes smaller as the search task becomes less cognitively demanding (Emrich et al., 2009; Luria &amp; Vogel, 2011), which may be relevant to VGP\u2019s who often engage in target-discrimination processes during gameplay.

", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited from the University of West England undergraduate psychology programme. At the beginning of the academic year participants completed a shortened version of the video game questionnaire as part of a large test battery. Responses from the Psychology Data Bank will be used to selectively recruit VGP\u2019s and NVGP\u2019s while not revealing why they are being recruited. This covert recruiting method will be used to avoid demand characteristics of the experimental situation (Boot, Blakely &amp; Simons, 2011). [A second video game questionnaire will be administered after participation to confirm VG-playing status.]\nIn line with the Bavelier lab\u2019s current protocol (https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/vgq/, November 2019), to qualify as a VGP a participant will need to report a minimum of 5 hours per week of action game play during the past year. Criterion for inclusion in the NVGP group will be a report of no more than 1 hour per week of action game play, no more than 3 hours per week of other game play and less than 5 hours per week when all game genres are summed during the past year.\n\nParticipants must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no skin sensitivities to participate. All those who participate will be compensated with course credit.\nMost prior related research has focused exclusively on male participants because of the relative scarcity of female VGPs. However, our existing pool (as assessed via the VG questionnaire from the Psychology Data Bank) includes very few males who qualify as NVGPs. This is largely driven by the relatively low number of males in psychology programmes. Due to the large number of females in our psychology programmes, we actually have a reasonably substantial pool of female VGPs, and thus we intend to recruit both male and female VGPs and NVGPs with the number of males/females in each group roughly matched. We do not expect gender to be a factor in VG enhancement because, upon training both males and females on action VGs, there were no differences in the improvements seen between the genders (Feng, Spence, &amp; Pratt, 2007). Further, other work assessing VG improvements found no differences between pre-existing male and female gamers (Cain, Landau, &amp; Shimamura, 2012; Appelbaum et al., 2013).\n\nReferences\n\nAppelbaum, L.

Accuracy will be calculated as the percentage of total trials on which participants made a correct response to the orientation of the target. Behavioural responses will be considered accurate if the participant responds with the correct orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the target stimulus between 200 and 1000 ms after the onset of the array. Response time will be recorded as the time between the onset of the stimulus array and the key press for each correct trial. \n\nEEG data. Continuous EEG will be recorded using a 64-channel electrode cap with actiCAP slim active electrodes. Impedances of all channels will be adjusted to below 25\u03a9. EEG will be amplified within a frequency band of 0.016 \u2013 100 Hz and digitised at a sampling rate of 500 Hz per channel.

EEG activity from parietal-occipital channels on the left (PO3, PO5, P3) and right (PO4, PO6, P4) sides of the head will be used to calculate the amplitude and latency of the N1 component. Mean amplitude measures of the N1 for each participant will be taken in a 25 ms latency window around the peak of the N1 observed.

EEG activity from parietal-occipital sites on the left (PO3, P3, P5) and right (PO4, P4, P6) sides of the head will be used to calculate N2pc difference waves: the difference between the activity in posterior electrodes contralateral minus those ipsilateral to the relevant popout target stimulus. Latencies of the N2pc component will be analysed using both peak latency measures and onset latency measures. To capture the onset latency we will calculate the fractional peak latency: the time at which the ERP waveform reached 50% of its peak amplitude. Mean amplitude measures of the N2pc will be taken in a 40 ms latency window around the peak of the N2pc observed. \nCDA amplitude. Activity in channels PO3, P3, P5, PO4, P4 and P6 will also be used to calculate the amplitude of the CDA component.

Fronto-central channels (FC5, C5, FC6, C6) will be used to assess the motor-related LRP component. The LRP component will be calculated time-locked to both the stimulus array and behavioural response. For both cases, the activity will be calculated as the voltage difference between electrodes over the motor cortices contralateral versus ipsilateral to the hand used to execute the response on each trial resulting in LRP difference waves. Latencies will be analysed using both peak latency measures and onset latency measures (see above for calculation). The amplitudes of the LRP components will be assessed in a 40 ms window around the grand-averaged peak observed in the session. Baseline correction of the stimulus-locked LRP will be performed by subtracting the mean amplitude from 200 ms before stimulus onset. Baseline correction of the response-locked LRP will be performed by subtracting the mean amplitude from 1.2 to 1s before the motor response. \nVG score.

ITEM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE INSERTED ITEM \n(i) McNemar's test will be used to analyze the effect of IV Item type (inserted vs. item before) on DV recall separately for the first insertion and second insertion blocks. \n(ii) Welch paired sample t-test will be used to analyze the effect of IV Item type (inserted vs. item before) on DV confidence rating separately for the first insertion and second insertion blocks. Provided confidence analyzes require participants to have recalled the item, these analyzes will only be conducted if there is a sufficient number of participants (16). \n\nTwo follow-up mixed effects regression analyses with recall (logistic) and confidence (gaussian) as the DVs will also be conducted. IVs insertion condition (Trial 4 vs. Trial 5), Item type (inserted vs. target before), and their interaction will be included as fixed factors with participant as a random effect. *Note* the mixed effects logistic regression analysis cannot be done in the case that an item is completely endorsed/not endorsed by all participants on at least one of the trials (Trial 4 and/or Trial 5). Confidence analyzes will only be conducted if there are a sufficient number of participants (16).", "outliers": "Data exclusions: \nAll written words during the encoding phase will be used in calculating descriptive measures for non-inserted words (e.g. endorsement and confidence) in the recall phase. If a participant does not type a word into their external store during the encoding phase, then the answers given for those specific unwritten words in the recall phase (e.g. endorsement and confidence) will not be included in the analyses or descriptive measures.\n\nIf participants recall the control item or inserted item but forget to give a confidence rating, then that participant will be excluded (since our DV's are looking at the confidence of that recalled item, but we are not able to infer it). \n\nIf participants did not write down the word before the inserted item in their external store, then the item before the item before will be used as a control for analysis that includes the word before the inserted item. If a participant did not write down the word before the inserted item and the word before that, then they will be excluded from all analyses (including descriptives).", "dependent": "1.

Confidence as continuous ratings from 1 to 4: (1: \"definitely not presented originally\" vs. 2: \"probably not presented...\" vs. 3: \"probably presented...\" vs. 4: \"definitely presented...\") is presented as an option for each word during recall trials, however by instruction, options 3 and 4 should only be chosen since participants are to only recall words that they remember were presented to them. \n\n3. After the first block in which a word is inserted into the \u200bparticipant's external memory store (block 4) participants are asked: \"We inserted '(inserted word specified)', did you notice? Please respond with 'y' for yes or 'n' for no\u201d. This question will be coded as yes vs. no (coded as binary 1 and 0 respectively).\n\n4. After the final block (block 5), participants will be asked a series of questions:\n(strategy)  \"Please select the option that best describes your recognition strategy during the final (fifth) block of this study (a) I relied exclusively on my typed list during the recognition task (b) I relied mostly on my typed list during the recognition task (c) I relied about equally on both my list and my internal memory during the recognition task (d) I relied mostly on my internal memory during the recognition task (e) I relied exclusively on my internal memory during the recognition task (z) None of the above\" This question will be coded using \"a\" = 1, \"b\" = 2, \"c\" = 3, etc., however, participants answering \"z\" will not be included in the analyses of this question and simply serves as a means to identify participants not using our expected memory strategies. \n\n(block 5 believe that  a word was inserted) \"On the last block we may have added a word to your typed list that was not presented originally, please respond with 'y' for yes or 'n' for no as to whether you believe we inserted a word into your list on your final block.\" This question will be coded as yes vs. no (coded as binary 1 and 0 respectively).\n\n(block 5 select word) \"Please review your list from the last block and type one word that you most think was added. Even if you don\u2019t think something was added, please guess.\" This question will be coded as inserted word specified vs. inserted word not specified (coded as 1 and 0 respectively).", "conditions": "This is a within-subjects experiment where on the fourth and fifth block, a word is inserted into the participant\u2019s typed list unbeknownst to them. \nWithin conditions:\nIV inserted item condition (first insertion vs. second insertion)\nIV Item type (inserted vs. item before (control))", "hypothesis": "Previous work showed that when a list of to-be-remembered words are offloaded into a computer file and a word is inserted (without the participant's knowledge) into that list, participants endorsed and were highly confident that the inserted word had been presented originally (Risko, Kelly, Patel &amp; Gaspar, 2019). We extend this notion by investigating how the perceived reliability of the external store influences this effect. That is, if the participant is made aware that their list has been tampered with on one block, will participants alter their behaviour on the following block such that participants will demonstrate more sensitivity to the manipulation of their external store?
