Post-conflict countries generally suffer from a severe \u201cbrain drain\u201d and thus a lack of qualified individuals, both in the public service and other domains in society. International donors have increasingly viewed diaspora returnees as a solution to remedy such brain drains, but at the same time avoid employing external actors who might be perceived as alien and neo-colonial and thereby harm local legitimacy. Several diaspora return programmes\u201d^1 have been established by international agencies with the objective to enable capacity building in state institutions in post-conflict countries. In some places, such as Afghanistan, international actors have placed returnees from the diaspora in top-positions in the government (Turner 2008). In Liberia, the UNDP supported the Liberia Emergency Capacity Building Support (LECBS)^2 project through which 16 cabinet ministers and the head of the Liberia National Police was recruited from the diaspora (Friedman 2012). Despite that many post-conflict government are filled with returnees from the diaspora and international actors openly support these recruitments, we have limited knowledge about how local populations view these individuals. Scant qualitative evidence from post-conflict contexts suggests that the diaspora identity may be used against returnees from the diaspora, especially when returnees take on top positions in governments. The relationship between locals and diaspora returnees is often characterized by an element of mistrust and questions about loyalty (S\u00e1nchez Villa, 2011:10, De Carvalho et al 2011:20, Republic of Liberia 2008:52f). Accordingly the position of the diaspora in their countries of origin is often heatedly debated among elites. This is particularly true in post-conflict settings. Whom that should have the right to represent the state at the highest level and be in control of the state\u2019s resources can be seen as the acid test of who should be included in the political community of a democracy. But to what extent the diaspora background by government officials are perceived as an identity of importance, and in that case if it is affecting the legitimacy of the government have not been systematically investigated. We know very little about the value citizens in post-conflict states devote to being a \u201clocal\u201d actor and how they interpret government officials\u2019 different background characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve our understanding of how local populations view returnees from the diaspora in governments and how this relates to the legitimacy of the government overall.

Given that today 43 out of the 50 most murderous cities in the world are in Latin America (The Economist 2017), that close to 65% of Latin Americans feel poorly protected against crime (Latinobarometro 2015), and that up to 15% believe that under some circumstances an authoritarian government is preferable to a democratic one (Latinobarometro 2015) in this study, we will embed two survey experiments in an omnibus survey in Mexico to test whether deficiencies in security provision in Latin America can persuade citizens to forego key democratic norms and values in order to feel safe again, and how the effect compares to deficiencies in economic performance.", "q16": "Our general hypothesis is that respondents who receive scenarios with poor physical security performance will be the most likely to accept deviations from liberal democracy, both at a system and a policy level. Conjoint Experiment H1: Both physical and economic security will increase the probability that respondents choose one scenario over the other. H1A: We expect to observe an interactive effect between physical and economic security with granting the executive more unilateral power. H1B: The effect of physical security will be larger than the effect of economic security. H1C: The difference in effects will be larger in regions where criminal violence is prevalent. H2: We expect respondents to strongly prefer the scenario they choose when facing a trade-off between a positive and a negative treatment Priming Experiment Question 1: H1: A larger percent of respondents who receive the negative security performance excerpt will support this policy compared to the other four groups. H1A: The difference in proportions will be largest in the more violent regions. Question 2: H1: We expect respondents who receive the positive economic and physical security treatments be less supportive of criticizing the government. H1A: The difference in proportions will be largest in the regions that are richer and non-violent. Question 3: H1: We expect there to be no difference in responses among the five groups Question 4: H1: A larger proportion of respondents in the groups that receive the negative physical and economic security performance excerpts will support this policy compared to the other three groups H1B: The difference in proportions will greater in regions that have either high violence and/or are poorer compared to the rest of the country. Question 5: H1: A larger proportion of respondents who receive the negative physical security performance excerpt will support this policy compared to the other four groups H1A: The difference in proportions will be largest in the more violent regions. Question 6 H1: A larger percent of respondents who receive the negative physical security performance excerpt will support this policy compared to the other four groups. H1A: The difference in proportions will be largest in the more violent regions.

{"extra": [], "value": "It has often been observed that states and nations emerge strengthened from episodes of violence, but the exact reasons for this remain moot. Classic theories argue that war can foster the selection of capable forms of military organization, and ratchet up state involvement in the economy (Tilly 1975, 1990; Mann 1986; Herbst 1990; North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009). Others have stressed the nation-building effect of socialization in the military (Weber 1976; Hobsbawm 1983). Adding to these established theories, we formulate and test the hypothesis that experiences of violence can strengthen the legitimacy of the state, and can increase citizen engagement. The theory we are proposing is simple: the experience of violence makes clear the power of politics in private affairs, and the necessity for collective defense, which, in turn, can only be provided by a functioning state. Victims of violence place a greater emphasis on citizen\u2019s duties, but also hold their representatives to account to a greater degree. Realizing that corruption and bad governance ultimately threaten their own security, victims are more likely to demand the removal of corrupt and incompetent politicians. We aim to test our theory on a random sample of n=2,500 Armenian citizens. Armenia offers a crucial test for the theory. According to estimates, about half of the Armenian population had family members killed during the Armenian genocide in the early 20th century, and thus has family memories of violence. In addition, Armenia fought a fierce war with Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno Karabakh in the early 1990s.

Classic theories argue that war can foster the selection of capable forms of military organization, and ratchet up state involvement in the economy (Tilly 1975, 1990; Mann 1986; Herbst 1990; North, Wallis, and Weingast 2009). Others have stressed the nation-building effect of socialization in the military (Weber 1976; Hobsbawm 1983). Adding to these established theories, we formulate and test the hypothesis that experiences of violence can strengthen the legitimacy of the state, and can increase citizen engagement. The theory we are proposing is simple: the experience of violence makes clear the power of politics in private affairs, and the necessity for collective defense, which, in turn, can only be provided by a functioning state. Victims of violence place a greater emphasis on citizen\u2019s duties, but also hold their representatives to account to a greater degree. Realizing that corruption and bad governance ultimately threaten their own security, victims are more likely to demand the removal of corrupt and incompetent politicians. We aim to test our theory on a random sample of n=2,500 Armenian citizens. Armenia offers a crucial test for the theory. According to estimates, about half of the Armenian population had family members killed during the Armenian genocide in the early 20th century, and thus has family memories of violence. In addition, Armenia fought a fierce war with Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno Karabakh in the early 1990s. The war claimed several thousand victims, meaning that many families in contemporary Armenia have recently lost relatives in warfare. We exploit these two sources of variation in victimization in mass violence to test our theory.

But does this tactic work? We study a unique natural experiment from Armenia that allows us to address this question. In spring 2018, Nikol Pashinyan, the main opposition leader, led a two-week march towards the country's capital Yerevan to mobilize the population against the prolongation of the autocratically ruling president, Serzh Sargsyan (Figure 1). In the wake of the march, thousands of Pashinyan's supporters started protesting in cities and towns across the country. We asked to what extent the march was successful in mobilizing voters. Were individuals that lived along the route of the march more likely to subsequently cast their vote, and did they vote for the revolutionary? To answer these questions, we draw on three data sources: first, we use election outcome data on the precinct level for the general elections to take place on 9 December 2018. Second, we use answers to a survey conducted among a random, nationally-representative sample of 2,500 Armenians shortly before the general elections. Third, we hand-collected and examined election records for all our respondents. We are therefore able to determine turnout in an objective fashion, rather than relying on voter self- reports.
