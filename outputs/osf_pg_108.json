Evidence from the COVID-19 Crises in Israel", "description": "Minority representation in bureaucracies is associated with enhanced public goods provision.\nYet, far less is known about its externalities for intergroup relations. I design a survey experiment to test whether information about the role of Arab healthcare workers in responding to the COVID-19 crises, reduces Jewish prejudice and promotes more inclusionary political attitudes. I further test whether politicians\u2019 exclusionary statements, attenuate the effects of minority representation on prejudice, and whether the severity of the COVID-19 crises amplifies the effects of minority representation on prejudice.

Currently our understanding of the sociodemographic predictors of unemployment for people with severe mental illness largely derives from small and laborious cross-sectional survey studies, which are often not ethnically diverse. Until now it has not been possible to investigate these predictors using large case registers such as electronic health records as patient occupations are poorly recorded and characterised in the structured, drop down fields of these records.

This review will use the Noblit and Hare (1988) proposed framework for meta-ethnography using seven key steps and the eMERGe reporting guidance (France et al., 2019) to increase confidence in meta-ethnography findings.\nStep 1: Getting started\nStep 2: Deciding what is relevant \nStep 3: Reading the studies \nStep 4: Determine how the studies are related \nStep 5: Translating studies into each other \nstep 6: Synthesizing the translation \nStep 7: Expressing the synthesis ", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "We will perform initial exploratory text searches using the keywords: therapeutic AND (exercise OR physical activity) AND (adherence OR concordance OR compliance). This initial step provides an overview of the topic and ensures an adequate number of citations are available to determine a search strategy for reviews on complex topics. The keywords and phrases identified in titles and abstracts and the MeSH/thesaurus terms would be used for a full database search across the following databases; Medline, CENTRAL, Embase, PsychINFO, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database) and CINAHL from inception to 2018. The list of citations will be screened for duplicates using the citation manager Mendeley.

Knight, Shannon Rafferty"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Attentional bias is a phenomenon wherein certain items are preferentially processed at the cost of other items in a visual field (MacLeod, Matthews &amp; Tata, 1896; Field &amp; Cox, 2008). It plays an important role in guiding visual behaviour, and is commonly studied in relation to addiction (Field &amp; Cox, 2008), where the development of addictive behaviours is consistently found to coincide with the development of an attentional bias towards addiction-related stimuli (Boyer &amp; Dickerson, 2003; Constantinou et al., 2010; Jones, Jones, Smith, &amp; Copley, 2003; Lusher, Chandler, &amp; Ball, 2004; Townshend &amp; Duka, 2001; Yaxley &amp; Zwaan, 2005). These biases appear to be causally linked to addictive behaviours. For example, a larger reduction in alcohol-related attentional bias during treatment is related to continued abstinence of alcohol consumption following release from rehabilitation centres (Cox, Hogan, Kristian, &amp; Race, 2002; Flaudias et al., 2013).\n\nMuch of what is known about attentional biases stems from research comparing substance abusers and addicted populations with healthy controls across a variety of paradigms, such as the modified Stroop (Lusher et al., 2004; Sharma, Albery, &amp; Cook, 2001), dot probe (Noel et al., 2006) and dual task paradigms (Waters &amp; Green, 2003). These investigations have established that people who are depended on or abuse alcohol have consistently faster reaction times towards task-relevant alcohol-related cues (Jones, Bruce, Livingstone, &amp; Reed, 2006; Jones, Jones, Blundell &amp; Bruce, 2002), and slower reaction times when alcohol-related cues interfere with task goals (Cox, Blount, &amp; Rozak, 2000; Johnsen, Laberg, Cox, Vaksdal, &amp; Hugdahl, 1994) than control participants. These studies have yielded valuable data on how attentional biases manifest in addicted and at-risk individuals. However, despite this, there are some methodological issues regarding the samples used in these investigations and the legitimacy by which these findings can be attributed to the wider population.\n\nSpecifically, the use of addicts is problematic because of neurophysiological differences between addicts and the healthy population (Baler &amp; Volkow, 2006; Cardenas, Studholme, Gazdzinski, Durazzo, &amp; Meyerhoff, 2007; George, Potts, Kothman, Martin, &amp; Mukundan, 2004; Goldstein &amp; Volkow, 2011; Medina et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2004). Long term alcohol abuse is related to a detrimental effect on brain structures relating to cognitive control and executive function such as the prefrontal cortex (George et al., 2004; Goldstein &amp; Volkow, 2011; Medina et al., 2008). Thus, observed differences in attention between abusers and healthy controls may be due to damage to essential neural networks. If the cause of the behavioural differences in addicted populations is due to differences in the brain, the findings observed within these populations cannot be compared to healthy, non-addicted controls \u2013 or to gamblers, who also exhibit attentional biases towards gambling-related items, without the confound of neurodisruptive substances (Boyer &amp; Dickerson, 2003). However, despite the strong links between behaviours such as addiction and cognitive processes such as attention, there is currently very little overlap in the literature.\n\nThe development of an arbitrary attentional bias has been previously investigated with research finding that an experiment information sheet which mentions the word green on it several times is sufficient to induce an attentional bias in a healthy population which persists for at least two weeks and effects performance on a task even when irrelevant (Knight et al., 2016; 2018). While these studies were able to show that an explicit reference to a stimulus can induce an attentional bias, more implicit attentional bias development has not yet been investigated. The current study aims to address this, by investigating the link between rewarding saccadic eye-movements towards an arbitrary stimulus and the potential development of an attentional bias toward the aforementioned stimulus."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "If participants can be subconsciously biased to the colour green during the training phase, then this will be reflected in reaction time accuracy changes in the experimental phase compared to the baseline phase of the change-detection task."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Stage 2 will use an eye-tracker. Stages 1 and 3 need only a computer screen and keyboard.\n\nStages 1 and 3 shall be identical and will be used to examine the baseline levels of attentional bias (stage 1) and potential modifications of attentional bias (stage 3) caused by the middle stage. This shall be achieved via a one-shot change-detection task which is an established method used to examine for attentional biases (Knight et al., 2016; 2018). The one-shot change-detection task will follow the following format: The experiment will begin with the presentation of a fixation cross for 1000ms followed by the stimulus array for 1500ms. The stimulus array will be a black screen with a circular array of six different coloured circles on it, all of the same size.

It plays an important role in guiding visual behaviour, and is commonly studied in relation to addiction (Field &amp; Cox, 2008), where the development of addictive behaviours is consistently found to coincide with the development of an attentional bias towards addiction-related stimuli (Boyer &amp; Dickerson, 2003; Constantinou et al., 2010; Jones, Jones, Smith, &amp; Copley, 2003; Lusher, Chandler, &amp; Ball, 2004; Townshend &amp; Duka, 2001; Yaxley &amp; Zwaan, 2005). These biases appear to be causally linked to addictive behaviours. For example, a larger reduction in alcohol-related attentional bias during treatment is related to continued abstinence of alcohol consumption following release from rehabilitation centres (Cox, Hogan, Kristian, &amp; Race, 2002; Flaudias et al., 2013).\n\nMuch of what is known about attentional biases stems from research comparing substance abusers and addicted populations with healthy controls across a variety of paradigms, such as the modified Stroop (Lusher et al., 2004; Sharma, Albery, &amp; Cook, 2001), dot probe (Noel et al., 2006) and dual task paradigms (Waters &amp; Green, 2003). These investigations have established that people who are depended on or abuse alcohol have consistently faster reaction times towards task-relevant alcohol-related cues (Jones, Bruce, Livingstone, &amp; Reed, 2006; Jones, Jones, Blundell &amp; Bruce, 2002), and slower reaction times when alcohol-related cues interfere with task goals (Cox, Blount, &amp; Rozak, 2000; Johnsen, Laberg, Cox, Vaksdal, &amp; Hugdahl, 1994) than control participants. These studies have yielded valuable data on how attentional biases manifest in addicted and at-risk individuals. However, despite this, there are some methodological issues regarding the samples used in these investigations and the legitimacy by which these findings can be attributed to the wider population.\n\nSpecifically, the use of addicts is problematic because of neurophysiological differences between addicts and the healthy population (Baler &amp; Volkow, 2006; Cardenas, Studholme, Gazdzinski, Durazzo, &amp; Meyerhoff, 2007; George, Potts, Kothman, Martin, &amp; Mukundan, 2004; Goldstein &amp; Volkow, 2011; Medina et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2004). Long term alcohol abuse is related to a detrimental effect on brain structures relating to cognitive control and executive function such as the prefrontal cortex (George et al., 2004; Goldstein &amp; Volkow, 2011; Medina et al., 2008). Thus, observed differences in attention between abusers and healthy controls may be due to damage to essential neural networks. If the cause of the behavioural differences in addicted populations is due to differences in the brain, the findings observed within these populations cannot be compared to healthy, non-addicted controls \u2013 or to gamblers, who also exhibit attentional biases towards gambling-related items, without the confound of neurodisruptive substances (Boyer &amp; Dickerson, 2003). However, despite the strong links between behaviours such as addiction and cognitive processes such as attention, there is currently very little overlap in the literature.\n\nThe development of an arbitrary attentional bias has been previously investigated with research finding that an experiment information sheet which mentions the word green on it several times is sufficient to induce an attentional bias in a healthy population which persists for at least two weeks and effects performance on a task even when irrelevant (Knight et al., 2016; 2018). While these studies were able to show that an explicit reference to a stimulus can induce an attentional bias, more implicit attentional bias development has not yet been investigated. The current study aims to address this, by investigating the link between rewarding saccadic eye-movements towards an arbitrary stimulus and the potential development of an attentional bias toward the aforementioned stimulus.", "q4": "If participants can be subconsciously biased to the colour green during the training phase, then this will be reflected in reaction time accuracy changes in the experimental phase compared to the baseline phase of the change-detection task.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Indeed, even during normal times, self- and other- perceptions have already been shown to influence our social perception, preference, and learning (Sui and Gu, 2017). Importantly, aberrant self and other representations are highly prevalent across a wide range of psychiatric disorders (Sui and Gu, 2017) such as major depressive disorder (MDD) (Northoff, 2007) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Chiu et al., 2008).
