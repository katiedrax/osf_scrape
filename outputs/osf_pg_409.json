In order to prevent newly enfranchised blacks from taking full advantage of their voting rights, states, counties, and other local jurisdictions converted formerly elected offices to appointed ones to prevent black voters from electing their desired candidates, converted single-member districts to at-large districts to dilute the black vote, and raised filing requirements to run for office in order to prevent black candidates from running. This study seeks to investigate whether jurisdictions that were freed by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder to change the architecture of their voting laws without getting preclearance from the federal government have engaged in the subtler forms of disenfranchisement they practiced after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. We focus on the size and selection procedures for county offices \u2013 elected vs. appointed \u2013 specifically because those features, unlike voter identification, convenience voting measures, and voting technology, are not protected by the remaining provisions of the VRA. In 1994 the U.S. Supreme Court held in Holder v. Hall that the size of a government body cannot be challenged under Section 2 of the VRA. Therefore, understanding the extent to which counties have changed the size or method of filling their commissions is a reliable indicator of the effect of Shelby County on the behavior of government officials unencumbered by the VRA."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary hypothesis is that local jurisdictions that were covered by the Voting Rights Act before Shelby County v.

In order to prevent newly enfranchised blacks from taking full advantage of their voting rights, states, counties, and other local jurisdictions converted formerly elected offices to appointed ones to prevent black voters from electing their desired candidates, converted single-member districts to at-large districts to dilute the black vote, and raised filing requirements to run for office in order to prevent black candidates from running. This study seeks to investigate whether jurisdictions that were freed by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder to change the architecture of their voting laws without getting preclearance from the federal government have engaged in the subtler forms of disenfranchisement they practiced after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. We focus on the size and selection procedures for county offices \u2013 elected vs. appointed \u2013 specifically because those features, unlike voter identification, convenience voting measures, and voting technology, are not protected by the remaining provisions of the VRA. In 1994 the U.S. Supreme Court held in Holder v. Hall that the size of a government body cannot be challenged under Section 2 of the VRA. Therefore, understanding the extent to which counties have changed the size or method of filling their commissions is a reliable indicator of the effect of Shelby County on the behavior of government officials unencumbered by the VRA.", "q16": "Our primary hypothesis is that local jurisdictions that were covered by the Voting Rights Act before Shelby County v.

In November 2017, the UN funded a stabilization project, in support of the African Union Peacekeeping troops (AMISOM) across 38 districts in South Central Somalia by hiring Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) to serve as the contact and resource persons for the UN and AMISOM and were also tasked to help raise awareness and understanding of the root causes of violent extremism in the rural communities.

Using variables from our second follow up phone survey titled \u201cSeptember 2018 Phone Survey\u201d (conducted 10 months post treatment in Sept 2018), we will run the following OLS regression: Outcome idt = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xid + \u03b4T + \u00b5r + \u0404it where \u2211 Xid are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, marital status, clan, indices of dwelling quality and asset ownership. T is the treatment indicator, and \u00b5r is the randomization pair dummies since randomization was strati\ufb01ed by pairs (BruhnandMcKenzie,2009), and \u0404it is the error term. Impact of the project, the intention to treat (ITT) effect of winning the job lottery, is captured by the coef\ufb01cient, \u03b4. \u2192Analysis Two: Multiple Observations After the third survey in September 2018 (\ufb01rst phone survey), we plan on conducting the same survey at least twice before the project closure in June 2021, which gives us four panel waves. Therefore, in addition to the \ufb01rst analysis stipulated above in section 6.1, I will carry out a second regression analysis where the variables from our phone survey, questions from part \ufb01ve to part nine (see annex-September 2018 phones survey), exactly match with those from the baseline, I will use two approaches and present results side by side. \u2192Analysis 2.1: ANCOVA Specification Outcome idt+1 = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xidt + \u03b4Tid + OutcomeBaseline idt + \u00b5r + \u0404it For the subsequent second and third phone follow up survey data, the ANCOVA speci\ufb01cation at time t=2,3,4 will be: Outcome idt= \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xid+1 + OutcomeBaseline idt=1 + \u03b42Tid*F t+1 + \u03b43Tid*F t+2 +\u03b44Tid*F t+3 + \u2211 s=2,..4 \u03c3s1(s = t) + \u00b5r + + \u0404it where Outcomeidt+1 is the relevant impact indicator in the \ufb01rst follow up phone survey in eq(2) and in round t in eq(3), OutcomeBaselineidt=1 is the outcome variable\u2019s baseline value, \u2211 Xid+1are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, marital status, clan, indices of dwelling quality and asset ownership.

Impact of the project, the intention to treat (ITT) effect of winning the job lottery, is captured by the coef\ufb01cient, \u03b4 by testing if \u03b4, (ten months post winning the job lottery)= \u03b42 (20 months) = \u03b43 (30 months) to determine whether the impacts differ over time, and whether \u03b4=\u03b42=\u03b43=0 to determine whether there is no impact over time. \u2192Analysis 2.2: Difference in Difference between Treatment and Control In my second approach, as specified above and after the completion of the first phone survey (September 2018 phone survey), I will use difference in difference specification to evaluate effects of having a stable job for ten months by estimating the following equation for individual $i$ using OLS: Outcome idt = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 X id + \u03b4T + \u03b8TF + \u03c0F + \u00b5r + \u0404it where \u2211 X idt are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, economic situation of the village, clan. T is the treatment indicator, F denotes the follow up observation as opposed to the baseline period, \u00b5r is the randomization pair dummies since randomization was stratified by pairs , and \u0404it is the error term. After the end of the project in June 2021 when multiple follow up survey data is available, I will use the following: Outcome idt = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 X id + \u03b41Ti + \u03b42TiF2t + \u03b43TiF3t + \u03b82F2t + \u03b83F3t + \u00b5r + \u0404it where \u2211 X idt are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, education, economic situation of the village and clan. T is the treatment indicator taking the value of 1 if subject i was won the job lottery, F2 and F3 are dummy variables for the second and third follow-up phone surveys, respectively. \u00b5r is the randomization pair dummies since randomization was stratified by pairs, and \u0404it is the error term."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Somalia"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "103 (55 control; 48

In November 2017, the UN funded a stabilization project, in support of the African Union Peacekeeping troops (AMISOM) across 38 districts in South Central Somalia by hiring Community Liaison Officers (CLOs) to serve as the contact and resource persons for the UN and AMISOM and were also tasked to help raise awareness and understanding of the root causes of violent extremism in the rural communities.

Using variables from our second follow up phone survey titled \u201cSeptember 2018 Phone Survey\u201d (conducted 10 months post treatment in Sept 2018), we will run the following OLS regression: Outcome idt = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xid + \u03b4T + \u00b5r + \u0404it where \u2211 Xid are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, marital status, clan, indices of dwelling quality and asset ownership. T is the treatment indicator, and \u00b5r is the randomization pair dummies since randomization was strati\ufb01ed by pairs (BruhnandMcKenzie,2009), and \u0404it is the error term. Impact of the project, the intention to treat (ITT) effect of winning the job lottery, is captured by the coef\ufb01cient, \u03b4. \u2192Analysis Two: Multiple Observations After the third survey in September 2018 (\ufb01rst phone survey), we plan on conducting the same survey at least twice before the project closure in June 2021, which gives us four panel waves. Therefore, in addition to the \ufb01rst analysis stipulated above in section 6.1, I will carry out a second regression analysis where the variables from our phone survey, questions from part \ufb01ve to part nine (see annex-September 2018 phones survey), exactly match with those from the baseline, I will use two approaches and present results side by side. \u2192Analysis 2.1: ANCOVA Specification Outcome idt+1 = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xidt + \u03b4Tid + OutcomeBaseline idt + \u00b5r + \u0404it For the subsequent second and third phone follow up survey data, the ANCOVA speci\ufb01cation at time t=2,3,4 will be: Outcome idt= \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 Xid+1 + OutcomeBaseline idt=1 + \u03b42Tid*F t+1 + \u03b43Tid*F t+2 +\u03b44Tid*F t+3 + \u2211 s=2,..4 \u03c3s1(s = t) + \u00b5r + + \u0404it where Outcomeidt+1 is the relevant impact indicator in the \ufb01rst follow up phone survey in eq(2) and in round t in eq(3), OutcomeBaselineidt=1 is the outcome variable\u2019s baseline value, \u2211 Xid+1are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, marital status, clan, indices of dwelling quality and asset ownership. Tid is the treatment indicator,F t+1,2,3 in eq(3) are dummies taking the value one in follow up phone surveys in rounds 1-3, \u03c3s are survey round dummies, \u00b5r is the randomization pair dummies since randomization was strati\ufb01ed by pairs (Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009), and it is the error term. Impact of the project, the intention to treat (ITT) effect of winning the job lottery, is captured by the coef\ufb01cient, \u03b4 by testing if \u03b4, (ten months post winning the job lottery)= \u03b42 (20 months) = \u03b43 (30 months) to determine whether the impacts differ over time, and whether \u03b4=\u03b42=\u03b43=0 to determine whether there is no impact over time. \u2192Analysis 2.2: Difference in Difference between Treatment and Control In my second approach, as specified above and after the completion of the first phone survey (September 2018 phone survey), I will use difference in difference specification to evaluate effects of having a stable job for ten months by estimating the following equation for individual $i$ using OLS: Outcome idt = \u03b3 + \u03b2 \u2211 X id + \u03b4T + \u03b8TF + \u03c0F + \u00b5r + \u0404it where \u2211 X idt are control variables for each individual and his/her household characteristics, which will include, age, gender, economic situation of the village, clan.

to raise revenues. The purpose of these transfers is to ensure all Canadians enjoy similar levels of services at similar levels of taxation. But the distribution of transfers is not always fair or efficient. One way to address this problem \u2013 and one that appears to work well in Australia \u2013 is to establish an independent fiscal council capable of assessing the performance of Canada\u2019s federal-provincial transfers. This body could work as a \u201cwatchdog,\u201d alerting voters to unfair and inefficient transfer arrangements. But the success of a council depends on its ability to convince voters to adhere to national standards of efficiency and fairness, even when those standards mean less money for their provinces. Is a council capable of such influence? This proposed survey experiment will examine this question by (1) identifying a situation in which voters of a Canadian province (Manitoba) unfairly benefit from Canada\u2019s transfer system; (2) exposing voters in that province to information about these benefits; and (3) examining whether a hypothetical council can convince them to accept policies that, if implemented, would result in a fairer transfer system, but fewer transfers for their province. To test this, we will randomly assign respondents to one of two groups: one in which other Canadian provinces complain that the respondent\u2019s province unfairly benefits from an aspect of Canada\u2019s equalization system and another in which an independent fiscal council claims they unfairly benefit. We will administer the web-based survey on a representative sample of residents (n-1,000) eligible to vote in Manitoba\u2019s provincial election, if that election were held on December 31, 2017 or after. The survey will be conducted by Research Now, which maintains a panel of 11-million respondents, including respondents in Manitoba."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We want to examine whether a hypothetical council can convince voters to accept changes to Canada\u2019s equalization system, even when those changes would result in fewer fiscal benefits for their province.

After exposing Manitobans to the vignette, we will ask whether they think Manitoba\u2019s equalization payments should be increased, decreased or kept the same and whether they agree or disagree with the statement that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the current equalization system. If the council is persuasive, the treatment group will, on average, be more likely to say Manitoba\u2019s transfers should be reduced. It will also be more likely to agree with the statement that Manitoba unfairly benefits from the equalization system. The literature suggests reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about the council\u2019s effect. Thus, we do not have any expectations about the size and direction of the treatment effect. We do, however, expect effects to vary across different groups, which we discuss next. Heterogeneous group effects Federal partisanship: We expect identification with the current federal government, which is Liberal, to enhance respondents\u2019 receptiveness to the council\u2019s views. We expect identification with other federal parties, and the federal Conservative party in particular, to weaken voters\u2019 receptiveness to the council\u2019s views. We also measure the strength of the respondent\u2019s identification with their preferred party. Income: We expect higher income individuals to be more receptive to the council\u2019s views. Left-right ideology: We expect right-wing voters to be more receptive to the council\u2019s position on this issue. Views on state and individual responsibility: We expect individuals who think individuals should take more responsibility for their personal well being to be more receptive to the council. Identity: We expect individuals with strong Canadian identities to be more receptive, than the average person, to the council\u2019s views. We expect individuals with strong provincial identities to be less receptive, than the average person, to the council\u2019s views. We do not expect individuals who identify equally with Canada and Manitoba to be any more or less receptive than the average respondent. Political Knowledge: We expect high-knowledge individuals to be less receptive to the council than low-knowledge individuals. Employment status: We expect individuals to be less receptive to the council if they or a member of their household has been unemployed at any point over the last 12 months of the survey.

The purpose of these transfers is to ensure all Canadians enjoy similar levels of services at similar levels of taxation. But the distribution of transfers is not always fair or efficient. One way to address this problem \u2013 and one that appears to work well in Australia \u2013 is to establish an independent fiscal council capable of assessing the performance of Canada\u2019s federal-provincial transfers. This body could work as a \u201cwatchdog,\u201d alerting voters to unfair and inefficient transfer arrangements. But the success of a council depends on its ability to convince voters to adhere to national standards of efficiency and fairness, even when those standards mean less money for their provinces. Is a council capable of such influence? This proposed survey experiment will examine this question by (1) identifying a situation in which voters of a Canadian province (Manitoba) unfairly benefit from Canada\u2019s transfer system; (2) exposing voters in that province to information about these benefits; and (3) examining whether a hypothetical council can convince them to accept policies that, if implemented, would result in a fairer transfer system, but fewer transfers for their province. To test this, we will randomly assign respondents to one of two groups: one in which other Canadian provinces complain that the respondent\u2019s province unfairly benefits from an aspect of Canada\u2019s equalization system and another in which an independent fiscal council claims they unfairly benefit. We will administer the web-based survey on a representative sample of residents (n-1,000) eligible to vote in Manitoba\u2019s provincial election, if that election were held on December 31, 2017 or after.

Notes: -For partisanship measures among the public, we will use respondent self-classification on a standard party ID measure and include leaners in the partisan groups. -For the elite sample, we use the following definitions: -Democrat=1, Republican=0: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as a Democrat; respondents to the public official survey who indicated they ran for office as a Democrat; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as a Democrat -Democrat=0, Republican=1: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as a Republican; respondents to the public official survey who indicated they ran for office as a Republican; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as a Republican -Democrat=0, Republican=0: Includes respondents to the National Candidate Survey who indicated they are running for office as independent/unaffiliated/third party candidate; respondents to the public official survey who ran for office but did not run as a Democrat or Republican; and elites and public respondents not in those categories who personally identify as an independent -The reference category for the elected official/candidate and appointed official indicators among elites is staff who work those officials and those who were hired by other means (e.g., directly through the civil service). -Because we intend to test hypotheses about differences in partisan factual polarization between elites and the public, we intend to pool our public and elite data. We therefore will not use the survey weights provided by ANES or YouGov to approximate a nationally representative sample. We will report the weighted survey marginals for the public samples and how they compare to the relevant elite survey marginals in an appendix. H1: For H1, we will first estimate a pooled model of the following form for the DVs where accuracy = higher values that includes fixed effects by issue and respondent and SEs clustered by respondent: Factual beliefs (where accuracy = higher values) = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * elite X Democrat + b5 * elite X Republican + b6 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b7 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b8 * female + b9 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b10 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b11 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b12 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + e We will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans in the public (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b4-b5|). We report differences in mean accuracy because the outcome variables are coded as either binary where 1=inaccurate, 0=accurate or ordered where higher values = more inaccurate. We take the absolute value of the D-R difference for the public and elites and the difference-in-differences because we are interested in levels of polarization, not its direction, and inaccuracy may be higher or lower for Democrats relative to Republicans for any given outcome measure. (We may also analyze or report the quantities above in directional terms (i.e., not take the absolute value) for expositional or analytical reasons.) We will then estimate an identical model without fixed effects separately for each issue and examine the extent to which the overall relationship we observe holds at the issue level. In addition, we will compare elite and public factual polarization on national issues where higher values indicate perceptions of greater prevalence (i.e., higher unemployment/foreign born). We will estimate separate models for each national issue using the approach described above to verify that the findings above hold for this different type of outcome measure. We may report these results in an appendix due to the coding difference for expositional reasons. Finally, among the set of issues where accuracy=higher values, we expect factual belief polarization to be higher for issues on which factual disputes are especially salient and controversial among partisan/ideological elites and the media: climate change, voter fraud, the tax system (i.e., the tax burden on the wealthy), and the distribution of federal spending (i.e., social versus military spending). We expect factual belief polarization to be less on issues that are more obscure or less closely aligned with the partisan/ideological divide: vaccines, foreign aid, and the deficit. To test this, we will estimate a version of the pooled model described above with an issue group interaction and test whether levels of factual belief polarization are larger among elites relative to the public on high-salience issues compared to low. We will estimate a pooled model of the following form that includes fixed effects by issue and respondent and SEs clustered by respondent: Factual beliefs (where accuracy = higher values) = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * elite X Democrat + b5 * elite X Republican + b6 * high-controversy issue (0=no, 1=yes) + b7 * elite X high-controversy issue + b8 * Democrat X high-controversy issue + b9 * Republican X high-controversy issue + b10 * elite X Democrat X high-controversy issue + b11 * elite X Republican X high-controversy issue + b12 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b13 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b14 * female + b15 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b16 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b17 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b18 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b19 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b20 * age 65 (0 if no, 1 yes) + e We will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans in the public on low-controversy issues (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites on low-controversy issues (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences on low-controversy issues (|b4-b5|). We will then do the same for high controversy issues (|(b2+b8)-(b3+b9)|, |(b2+b8 + b10) - (b3+b9+b11)|, and (|b10-b11|), respectively) and compute the difference-in-difference-in-differences (|(b4-b5) - (b10-b11)|). H2: We test this hypothesis by estimating one model for each issue on which government officials in our sample have relevant experience: local unemployment and voter fraud. For unemployment, we consider whether partisan factual polarization is lower among mayors, city council members, and city managers (for whom experience=1) than among other officials whose job responsibilities do not involve some aspect of the local economy (for whom experience=0). For voter fraud, we conduct two tests. First, we compare partisan factual polarization among state and local officials who ran for elected office (experience=1) to state and local officials who did not run for (i.e., were appointed to) state and local office (experience=0). Second, we compare partisan factual polarization across local government officials who report that their job involves the implementation of elections and/or the tallying of votes (experience=1) to local government officials who report that their job does not involve the implementation of elections and/or the tallying of votes (experience=0). For both unemployment and voter fraud, the model will take the following form: Factual beliefs = b0 + b1 * experience (0=no, 1=yes; described below) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * experience X Democrat + b5 * experience X Republican + b6 * elected official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b7 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b8 * female + b9 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b10 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b11 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b12 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * unemployment level in respondent county + e To test H2, we will compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican officials who lack relevant experience (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites who have such experience (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b4-b5|), which tests whether partisan factual belief polarization is lower among officials with relevant experience than among those who lack it. (These models are estimated only among elites who responded to the public official survey on these issues.) H3: To test H3, we will estimate separate models of the following form for unemployment levels and number of foreign born, the two issues for which we have both local and national perception measures: Factual beliefs = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * local issue (0=outcome is perception of national unemployment or percentage foreign born, 1=outcome is perception of county unemployment or percentage foreign born) + b5 * Democrat X local issue + b6 * Republican X local issue + b7 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b8 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b9 * female + b10 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b11 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b12 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b16 * actual county value (foreign born or unemployment level in respondent county) + e For each issue, we will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on national issues (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on local issues (|(b2+b5) - (b3+b6)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b5-b6|). Notes: -This study uses four data sources: National Candidate Study, public official survey, general public survey, and ANES (all discussed above). Because the public official survey and general public surveys will be fielded at roughly the same time, we may limit our in-text discussion to these two data sources and report the National Candidate Study and/or ANES results in an appendix. If all four datasets are pooled to test H1, we will account for unobserved differences resulting from pooling with fixed effects. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit.

For both unemployment and voter fraud, the model will take the following form: Factual beliefs = b0 + b1 * experience (0=no, 1=yes; described below) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * experience X Democrat + b5 * experience X Republican + b6 * elected official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b7 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes) + b8 * female + b9 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b10 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b11 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b12 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * unemployment level in respondent county + e To test H2, we will compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican officials who lack relevant experience (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democratic and Republican elites who have such experience (|(b2+b4) - (b3+b5)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b4-b5|), which tests whether partisan factual belief polarization is lower among officials with relevant experience than among those who lack it. (These models are estimated only among elites who responded to the public official survey on these issues.) H3: To test H3, we will estimate separate models of the following form for unemployment levels and number of foreign born, the two issues for which we have both local and national perception measures: Factual beliefs = b0 + b1 * elite (0=public, 1=elite) + b2 * Democrat (0=not Democrat, 1=Democrat) + b3 * Republican (0=not Republican, 1=Republican) + b4 * local issue (0=outcome is perception of national unemployment or percentage foreign born, 1=outcome is perception of county unemployment or percentage foreign born) + b5 * Democrat X local issue + b6 * Republican X local issue + b7 * elected official or candidate (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b8 * appointed official (0 if no, 1 yes [elites only]) + b9 * female + b10 * college graduate (0 if no, 1 if yes) + b11 * non-white (0 if self-identify as white, 1 if self-identify as non-white) + b12 * age 18-29 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b13 * age 30-44 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b14 * age 45-64 (0 if no, 1 yes) + b15 * age 65+ (0 if no, 1 yes) + b16 * actual county value (foreign born or unemployment level in respondent county) + e For each issue, we will then compute the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on national issues (|b2-b3|), the absolute value of the average difference in factual beliefs between Democrats and Republicans on local issues (|(b2+b5) - (b3+b6)|, and the absolute value of the difference-in-differences (|b5-b6|). Notes: -This study uses four data sources: National Candidate Study, public official survey, general public survey, and ANES (all discussed above). Because the public official survey and general public surveys will be fielded at roughly the same time, we may limit our in-text discussion to these two data sources and report the National Candidate Study and/or ANES results in an appendix. If all four datasets are pooled to test H1, we will account for unobserved differences resulting from pooling with fixed effects. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -Don\u2019t know responses will be considered missing data for the factual belief outcome measures. -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our samples. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "Dartmouth: STUDY00030024; Stanford: eProtocol #40149.
