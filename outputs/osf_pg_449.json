Multiple databases of indexed and grey literature will be searched with a specific focus on existing electronic and paper-electronic systems in LMICs that collect continuous, prospective, and individual-level data from antenatal care, delivery, neonatal care (up to 28 days), and postpartum (up to 42 days) at the facility and community level, at the national and district level, and at large hospitals. Also, experts will be contacted to identify unpublished information on relevant data collection systems. General and specific descriptions of Health Information Systems (HIS) extracted from the different sources will be combined and duplicated HIS will be removed, producing a list of unique statements. We will present a final list of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health systems considered flexible enough to be updated with necessary improvements to detect, assess and respond to safety concerns during the introduction of vaccines and other maternal health interventions. Selected experts will participate in an in-person consultation meeting to select up to three systems to be further explored in situ. Results and knowledge gaps will be synthesized after expert consultation", "category": "other", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-22T12:49:22.026565", "date_modified": "2020-01-22T12:56:02.521056", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "9c0fee633ced30e04983e4cea56af411fbea74f1f4a0181c3aa73b0b226f1c09c10db1c9440bb3d7fc398fdcd83eb81ad731445ac9f4e9b83dc53218fc6f27383c15ffd5887780f0450dfebc7a4fe12d4c8049330b26dc4c08ea4932bb633dbb49d1ea3a606f23e186cdf2b289f38143cac637519a305e3ae15db0e38fccd37bcbe01c032884823c1dfbdd7cd3fc7f45", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": "", "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-22T12:49:22.001848", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This is a registration for a study protocol.

Loschelder, Marie-Lena Frech"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Price is an influential parameter for purchase decisions, which is why it is an important part of consumer research.  In pricing studies, a distinction is usually made between three basic pricing strategies: of round ($150.00), just-below ($149.99), and precise ($151.11) prices. However, the research results on effectiveness of the respective strategies are not unequivocal.\n\nA pervasive pricing strategy in retail are just below prices (Holdershaw, Gendall &amp; Garland, 1997). According to so called level or first digit effects people round prices down or focus on the leftmost digit which lead to a preference of just below prices as they were perceived as lower than round prices (Schindler &amp; Wiman, 1989).\n\nAnother theory documents an association mechanism of the price and quality image of products. This theory argues that just below prices are perceived as low, discount prices and thus have a more advantageous price image compared to round prices.

However, the research results on effectiveness of the respective strategies are not unequivocal.\n\nA pervasive pricing strategy in retail are just below prices (Holdershaw, Gendall &amp; Garland, 1997).

People with alcohol dependence or opioid use disorder are at substantially increased risk of suicide and non-fatal self-harm. However, current suicide estimates are mainly based on data from outside England and comprehensive up-to-date data from England is lacking. This is particularly important because in recent years there have been both substantial reductions to drug and alcohol services in England and an upward trend in drug-related deaths.

Three options entail spending more during the working years than during retirement; one option keeps spending constant across both career stages; and two options entail spending less during the working years than during retirement. The latter two options reflect motivation to increase one's deposit into their retirement fund.\n\nStudy 2's main dependent measure is based on a task developed by Hershfield et al. (2011). In this task, participants read the following instructions: \"Imagine that you had just unexpectedly received $1,000. How much of this money would you allocate to each of the following options? Keep in mind that your numbers should add to 1,000.\" Participants will then see five different options: Use it to buy something nice for someone special; invest it in a retirement fund (the DV), put it into a savings account; use it to buy something nice for myself; plan a fun and extravagant occasion.\n\nBoth studies will include an additional DV: whether people believe that they will decrease, keep constant, or increase their retirement deposit in the next month. \n\nOther measured variables include how important people find financial planning to be; how important retirement preparation is to people's financial planning; how often they thought about retirement preparation; and whether they will discuss retirement preparation with their social network in the next week. \n\nA document with all measures to be used in this research is attached.

This analysis will be restricted to the subset of clients with genotypes UM &amp; NM who were treated with buprenorphine.  The hypothesis predicts that UM clients will require higher doses of buprenorphine than NM clients with similar levels of codeine use.", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=xk4j3", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/au-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "au-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xk4j3", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "xk4j3", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/gp6dt/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "gp6dt", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mq8r2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "mq8r2", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/xk4j3/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/xk4j3/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=448", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=450", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
