This literature tends to explore how institutional qualities related to procedures and performances affect the legitimacy of IOs. On the procedural side, research examines how conformance to qualities such as participation, efficiency, and impartiality affects legitimacy perceptions. On the performance side, research examines the importance for legitimacy of qualities such as problem-solving, welfare gains, and distributive justice. This study moves beyond earlier research in two respects. First, it integrates the political authority and the organizational purpose of an IO as a third and fourth institutional quality potentially affecting its perceived legitimacy. This is based on the intuition that people might not only evaluate IOs based on their procedures and performances, but also based on their level of political authority (Z\u00fcrn 2018) and their organizational missions or mandates (Scott 1991; Lenz and Viola 2017). Authority and purpose might generate or reduce legitimacy in and of themselves, irrespective of an IO\u2019s other institutional qualities. Second, it uses a conjoint design to estimate the causal effects of multiple institutional qualities simultaneously (see also Bechtel and Scheve 2013).

important role in shaping development outcomes. When cooperation occurs, mayors and traditional authorities are able to leverage their respective strengths to provide more and better public goods. Yet, such cooperation does not always occur with important implications for within-district inequality. The research associated with this pre-analysis plan investigates the decision of community leaders to support some mayoral candidates over others. Community leaders vote for candidates that they expect 1) to reciprocate electoral support with benefits and 2) to address contingent demands that arise during the mayor's term in office. I hypothesize that a sense of trust and reciprocity is best proxied by candidates' membership in a traditional community. Candidates need not be from the community of the traditional authority to receive support. Simply being from a community, as opposed to owning private property, is a sufficient proxy for trust and reciprocity that plays an important role in structuring the decision-making calculus of traditional leaders. This question contributes to a longstanding literature on the interaction of state and traditional institutions (Lerner 1958, Huntington 2006, Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2014, Cramb and Willis 1990, Baldwin 2015). Specifically, it seeks to add to a recent and growing scholarship on the relationship between traditional authorities and politicians, focusing largely on the role of traditional authorities as brokers for politicians (de Kadt and Larreguy 2014; Baldwin 2013). Under these models, traditional leaders support the candidates who can offer them resources and guarantee their survival. Yet, when are these promises credible? I argue that in Latin America shared membership in a traditional institution plays an important role in determining the degree to which traditional authorities trust mayoral candidates to address their concern and reciprocate support once in office. The findings of this project may also have important implications for intra-district inequality in rural Latin America. If community leaders systematically support candidates from communities, and communities comprise a large enough proportion of the electorate to consistently elect these candidates, then we might expect communities to disproportionately benefit from municipal resources. Conversely, and as seems to more often be the case, if communities vote in blocs yet comprise a small proportion of the electorate, communities may receive unequal access to municipal resources."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "I expect that community leaders decide to vote for candidates who can credibly commit to addressing community leaders' demands and/or reciprocating community leaders' electoral support. Traditional communal landholding institutions in rural Latin America, especially Mexico and Peru, are characterized by traditional norms of reciprocity, where individuals help each other today with the expectation that they will be helped, if needed, tomorrow. Such traditions are only rarely associated with other forms of land tenure. Thus, candidates who are from communal landholding institutions are seen as more likely to share these norms of trust and reciprocity. Therefore, when a candidate is from a traditional community, they are more likely to receive support from community leaders than when they are not identified as a member of a community. Localism (i.e. membership in the same community as the community leader) is expected to exacerbate a shared sense of trust and reciprocity. Thus, candidates who are from the same community as the community leader are expected to be viewed even more favorably. These effects are expected to be stronger for current presidents than ex-presidents, as collaborations with mayors are more salient for current presidents than former ones. H1: Community leaders will be more likely to support candidates from their communities over those candidates who are not from their communities. [Localism and shared community membership] H2: Community leaders will be more likely to support candidates who are from a community over candidates who are not from a community. [Community membership] H3: Community presidents will express greater trust in a partner who is from a community than a partner who is not identified as being from a community. H4: The proposed effect specified in H2 should be greater for current presidents than former presidents, given that relationships of collaboration and coordination with the municipal government are more proximate for current presidents than for former ones."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The hypotheses will be evaluated using two experiments embedded in an original survey of 200-300 current and former community presidents in Cusco, Peru. A conjoint experiment will be used to evaluate whether a candidate's membership in 1) a community and 2) the community president's own community affect the decision of community president's to support that candidate. I evaluate these traits against other candidate attributes, which include gender, party affiliation, and key campaign promise. I use a non-parametric regression estimator to obtain the Average Marginal Component Effect of community membership.

When cooperation occurs, mayors and traditional authorities are able to leverage their respective strengths to provide more and better public goods. Yet, such cooperation does not always occur with important implications for within-district inequality. The research associated with this pre-analysis plan investigates the decision of community leaders to support some mayoral candidates over others. Community leaders vote for candidates that they expect 1) to reciprocate electoral support with benefits and 2) to address contingent demands that arise during the mayor's term in office. I hypothesize that a sense of trust and reciprocity is best proxied by candidates' membership in a traditional community. Candidates need not be from the community of the traditional authority to receive support. Simply being from a community, as opposed to owning private property, is a sufficient proxy for trust and reciprocity that plays an important role in structuring the decision-making calculus of traditional leaders. This question contributes to a longstanding literature on the interaction of state and traditional institutions (Lerner 1958, Huntington 2006, Diaz-Cayeros et al. 2014, Cramb and Willis 1990, Baldwin 2015). Specifically, it seeks to add to a recent and growing scholarship on the relationship between traditional authorities and politicians, focusing largely on the role of traditional authorities as brokers for politicians (de Kadt and Larreguy 2014; Baldwin 2013). Under these models, traditional leaders support the candidates who can offer them resources and guarantee their survival. Yet, when are these promises credible? I argue that in Latin America shared membership in a traditional institution plays an important role in determining the degree to which traditional authorities trust mayoral candidates to address their concern and reciprocate support once in office. The findings of this project may also have important implications for intra-district inequality in rural Latin America. If community leaders systematically support candidates from communities, and communities comprise a large enough proportion of the electorate to consistently elect these candidates, then we might expect communities to disproportionately benefit from municipal resources. Conversely, and as seems to more often be the case, if communities vote in blocs yet comprise a small proportion of the electorate, communities may receive unequal access to municipal resources.", "q16": "I expect that community leaders decide to vote for candidates who can credibly commit to addressing community leaders' demands and/or reciprocating community leaders' electoral support. Traditional communal landholding institutions in rural Latin America, especially Mexico and Peru, are characterized by traditional norms of reciprocity, where individuals help each other today with the expectation that they will be helped, if needed, tomorrow. Such traditions are only rarely associated with other forms of land tenure. Thus, candidates who are from communal landholding institutions are seen as more likely to share these norms of trust and reciprocity. Therefore, when a candidate is from a traditional community, they are more likely to receive support from community leaders than when they are not identified as a member of a community. Localism (i.e. membership in the same community as the community leader) is expected to exacerbate a shared sense of trust and reciprocity. Thus, candidates who are from the same community as the community leader are expected to be viewed even more favorably. These effects are expected to be stronger for current presidents than ex-presidents, as collaborations with mayors are more salient for current presidents than former ones. H1: Community leaders will be more likely to support candidates from their communities over those candidates who are not from their communities. [Localism and shared community membership] H2: Community leaders will be more likely to support candidates who are from a community over candidates who are not from a community. [Community membership] H3: Community presidents will express greater trust in a partner who is from a community than a partner who is not identified as being from a community. H4: The proposed effect specified in H2 should be greater for current presidents than former presidents, given that relationships of collaboration and coordination with the municipal government are more proximate for current presidents than for former ones.", "q17": "The hypotheses will be evaluated using two experiments embedded in an original survey of 200-300 current and former community presidents in Cusco, Peru. A conjoint experiment will be used to evaluate whether a candidate's membership in 1) a community and 2) the community president's own community affect the decision of community president's to support that candidate. I evaluate these traits against other candidate attributes, which include gender, party affiliation, and key campaign promise. I use a non-parametric regression estimator to obtain the Average Marginal Component Effect of community membership. I then measure the proposed \"trust/reciprocity\" mechanism through an experimental behavioral game. Using a trust game (see Berg et al. 1995), I measure how much money community presidents award to a fellow community member as opposed to a partner who is not identified as a community member.
