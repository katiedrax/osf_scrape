figures. The trend has grown rapidly, with prominent organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact receiving national recognition and journalism awards. The work of fact-checking organizations is often cited in the media, giving credibility and professional acceptance to this new form of political coverage. There is currently very little literature on the effects of fact-checking. Moreover, existing research on the effects of correcting misperceptions has generated conflicting results. Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. The specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. Our experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Exposure to an individual fact-check or to summary fact-check information will reduce perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability H2: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will be lower for participants exposed to summary fact-check information than for those exposed to an individual fact-check H3: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will change more in response to individual or summary fact-check exposure among opposition partisans than among co-partisans RQ1: Will the effects of exposure to fact-check information on perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability vary by political knowledge/education or between partisans who are low vs. high in political knowledge/education?

All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study. The sample size will be approximately 2800 \u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Our secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well).

The trend has grown rapidly, with prominent organizations such as FactCheck.org and PolitiFact receiving national recognition and journalism awards. The work of fact-checking organizations is often cited in the media, giving credibility and professional acceptance to this new form of political coverage. There is currently very little literature on the effects of fact-checking. Moreover, existing research on the effects of correcting misperceptions has generated conflicting results. Nyhan and Reifler (2010) found that corrections failed to reduce misperceptions and, in some extreme cases produced a \u201cbackfire effect\u201d in which corrections strengthened misperceptions. Fridkin et al. (2015) showed that fact-checks of negative television advertisements influenced people\u2019s assessments of the accuracy, usefulness, and tone of negative political advertisements. Finally, Nyhan and Reifler (2016) showed that there was no evidence that exposure to fact-checking affected people\u2019s attitudes toward the practice, trust in politicians, or feelings of political efficacy, but exposure to fact-checking did increase how much people knew about contemporary political controversies and debates. The specific objective of this project is to examine the effects of summary fact-checking, an innovation in the field that is becoming more common. This format presents an overview of ratings of the accuracy of a politician\u2019s statements rather than an evaluation of a single statement. Our study will measure the effects of summary fact-checks on a politician\u2019s perceived accuracy and favorability. This project will also compare the effects of summary fact-checks to individual fact-checks that only verify a singular statement. We expect that summary fact-checking will be seen as more comprehensive and less selective than individual fact-checks and may therefore have a greater effect on public perceptions of politicians. Our experiment will therefore assess whether or not the effect of individual fact-checks differs from the effect of summary fact-checks on an individual\u2019s favorability toward a politician or the perceived accuracy of their statements. We will also take the political affiliation of both the participant and the politician into account, so we can determine whether the effects of individual and summary fact-checks vary by whether the target is a co-partisan or an opposition partisan. Finally, we will also consider whether these effects vary by political knowledge and analyze whether exposure to summary or individual fact-checks affects attitudes toward the practice more generally. The results of this experiment will allow us to understand the efficacy of different forms of fact-checking, which may help us better understand how news outlets\u2019 fact-checking practices influence public opinion.", "q16": "H1: Exposure to an individual fact-check or to summary fact-check information will reduce perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability H2: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will be lower for participants exposed to summary fact-check information than for those exposed to an individual fact-check H3: Perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability will change more in response to individual or summary fact-check exposure among opposition partisans than among co-partisans RQ1: Will the effects of exposure to fact-check information on perceptions of politician accuracy and favorability vary by political knowledge/education or between partisans who are low vs. high in political knowledge/education? RQ2: Will exposure to fact-check information change opinions toward the practice of fact-checking generally?", "q17": "Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants will be United States residents age 18 and over recruited on the Amazon Mechanical Turk online marketplace. All Turkers are eligible to participate in this study who meet the specified qualifications and did not take part in an earlier pilot study. The sample size will be approximately 2800 \u2013 data collection will continue until all funds allocated to the project are exhausted. Researchers have no role in selecting the participants after listing the project on Mechanical Turk. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to one of six conditions by the Qualtrics online survey platform (p=1/6 for each): Summary fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Individual fact-check treatment conditions: -Fact-checking a Democrat (Harry Reid; asked about him first) -Fact-checking a Republican (Mitch McConnell; asked about him first) Control conditions (placebo image/text; no fact-check provided): -Asked about perceptions of a Democrat first (Harry Reid) -Asked about perceptions of a Republican first (Mitch McConnell) Data collection and blinding Data will be collected on the Qualtrics online survey platform. There may be some online discussion among Mechanical Turk workers about the details of our survey. This cannot be prevented and we hope that these participants preserve the integrity of the research. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our primary outcome variables are perceptions of the favorability and accuracy of the fact-check target (McConnell or Reid) compared to participants in the control group who were asked first about the same person. Each outcome variable will be measured on a five-point scale: The next few questions will be about Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator McConnell (R-KY)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) The next few questions will be about Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), the former Majority Leader of the Senate. In general, how often do you think that he makes accurate statements? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of Senator Reid (D-NV)? -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Our secondary outcome variables measure opinions toward fact-checking using the following questions, which will be analyzed separately and also as a composite measure if they scale together using principal components factor analysis. In general, how favorable or unfavorable is your overall opinion of the fact-checking movement in journalism? -Very favorable (6) -Somewhat favorable (5) -Slightly favorable (4) -Slightly unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Thinking about the amount of fact-checking that you see being performed today by journalists, do you think there should be more fact-checking, the current amount of fact-checking is about right, or there should be less fact-checking? -There should be more fact-checking. (3) -The current amount of fact-checking is about right. (2) -There should be less fact-checking. (1) In general, how often do you think articles published by fact-checkers are accurate? -All of the time (5) -Most of the time (4) -About half the time (3) -Occasionally (2) -Never (1) In presenting the news dealing with political and social issues, do you think fact-checkers deal fairly with all sides or tend to favor one side? -Fact-checkers tend to deal fairly with all sides. (1) -Fact-checkers tend to favor one side. (0) Statistical analyses For each of our analyses, we will use OLS with robust standard errors and estimate ordered probit models with robust standard errors as a robustness check. Unless otherwise noted, all experimental treatment effects will be estimated as intent to treat effects. Leaners will be treated as partisans in our statistical analyses. Perceptions of politicians will only be assessed for the first politician for which outcome measures were collected to avoid contrast effects. Participants\u2019 political knowledge will be assessed with a standard five-question battery that test participant knowledge of U.S. electoral rules and awareness of current political figures. Partisanship is measured on a standard seven-point scale administered via branching questions. Our primary model will be pooled regressions for individuals who saw either candidate, but we will also estimate regressions interacting target politician with fact-checking type (the main explanatory variable). If we cannot reject the null of no difference in effects by target, we will present the pooled model and also present separate results for Reid and McConnell either in the main text or an appendix. If the effects of key explanatory variables differ depending on the fact-checking target, we will present separate models for Reid and McConnell in the main text for expositional clarity and present interactive models in an appendix. We will estimate marginal effects as appropriate when interaction terms are included in our models. (We will also estimate our treatment effect models with standard demographic controls and report these results if the treatment effect estimate is substantively different from the model only including partisan affiliation.) To test H1, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for the accuracy and favorability outcome measures. To test H2, we will then evaluate b1-b2 directly for each outcome measure. To test H3, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition and then estimate b5-b6 and b7-b8. [Per above, we will estimate all pairwise comparisons in treatment effects between partisan groups. However, we expect to encounter power problems given the relatively small number of pure independents and may thus focus on the comparison between the co-partisan and opposition partisan groups.] To test RQ1, we will first estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*knowledge+ b4*summaryFCXknowledge+b5*individualFCXknowledge and then estimate y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC+b3*copartisan+b4*opposition+b5*summaryFCXcopartisan+b6*summaryFCXopposition+b7*individualFCXcopartisan+b8*individualFCXopposition +b9*knowledge+b10*summaryFCXknowledge+b11*individualFCXknowledge+b12*copartisanXknowledge+b13*oppositionXknowledge+b14*summaryFCXknowledgeXopposition+b15*individualFCXknowledgeXopposition. In each model, we will estimate whether the effects of the fact-checks vary by political knowledge versus the control group and each other (and, in the latter case, by partisanship as well). We will test whether the effect of knowledge is linear per Hainmueller et al. and follow their recommendations if not. We may also present a simple median split on knowledge in the main text and report the continuous interaction model in the appendix for expositional clarity. We will follow the same procedures for education, grouping all the some college/associate groups together in the continuous measure and treating college/non-college as the relevant binary measure. To test RQ2, we will estimate the model y=b0+b1*summaryFC+b2*individualFC for individual fact-check opinion measures and the composite fact-check opinion measure (if they scale together) and then

To test this hypothesis, we conduct an online survey experiment on American subjects. We randomly expose subjects to different information contained in either a real or a hypothetical scenario about an earthquake and a subsequent offer of international assistance from the international community.

To test this hypothesis, we conduct an online survey experiment on American subjects. We randomly expose subjects to different information contained in either a real or a hypothetical scenario about an earthquake and a subsequent offer of international assistance from the international community.

Proponents of deliberative democracy theory argue that they have a solution to this problem. Deliberative democrats contend that, engaging in public deliberation, i.e. \u201ccommunication [that] induces reflection on preferences in non-coercive fashion\u201d (Dryzek, 2000, p. 76), where they can share arguments, narratives and stories with diverse others can lead citizens to come to more informed, considered, and reflective judgements. Although this assumption has been widely prevalent within the scholarship, it has mostly been theoretical in nature. There has been scarce attempts at empirically testing the validity of this claim. It is understandable, given some serious empirical challenges related to testing the assumptions of deliberative democracy. Some scholars argue that the biggest challenge is to near impossibility of creating a political talk which meets all the normative requirements of deliberative democrats in order to be called a deliberation (Karpowitz & Mendelberg, 2011; Mutz, 2006). Even in cases where a set of quasi-deliberative discussions are carefully constructed for the purposes of empirical research, it is challenging to disentangle the effects of different elements of the \u201cgrand treatment\u201d (Karpowitz & Mendelberg, 2011, p. 263), when the components constituting the deliberation are varied at the same time (Mutz, 2006, p. 58). Therefore, in this project, rather than studying an ideal deliberation per se with all its normative components, and requirements, consistent with Mutz (2002, 2006), Hwang et al. (2018) and others, I will focus on one component of deliberation, which constitutes an integral part of almost all of its definitions: citizens\u2019 exposure to political disagreement. Although I understand it cannot fully reflect the whole idea of deliberative democracy of what public deliberation entails, examining one separate component I believe can be useful for uncovering the \u201cblackbox\u201d of deliberation. Prior empirical research examined other putative benefits of exposure to disagreement, such as political tolerance (Mutz, 2002), open-mindedness (Hwang et al., 2018), political participation (Ikeda & Boase, 2011) and citizens\u2019 ability to generate reasons (Price, Cappella, & Nir, 2002).

The authors use \u2018argument repertoire\u2019, the number of arguments individuals can give in favour and against the issue - as a proxy for the quality of public opinion. I believe merely knowing about different arguments is not a precise indication of considered political opinion.

I will use two proxies for the reflectiveness of political judgements. The main proxy is Integrative Complexity (IC) measure by Tetlock (1983). It is captured by an open-ended question, asking the respondent to justify her opinion in several sentences. High complexity scores show more considered opinions. The coding mechanism of the qualitative data captured by the open-ended question consists of two properties: differentiation and integration (Suedfeld & Tetlock, 1977), where the differentiation is the number of characteristics of an issue that an individual takes into account, and integration is more sophisticated connections among these dimensions / characteristics.

I manipulate the exposure to disagreement in the experiment, by presenting the respondents with a short paragraph depicting a couple (+ a stock photo) who hold a view opposed to one the respondent holds. In order to exposure the respondent to opposing view, I will first measure her baseline attitudes on the issue and depending on her response she will be assigned to a vignette with an opposing view (if she is randomly assigned to a treatment group). I will use two proxies for the reflectiveness of political judgements. The main proxy is Integrative Complexity (IC) measure by Tetlock (1983). It is captured by an open-ended question, asking the respondent to justify her opinion in several sentences. High complexity scores show more considered opinions. The coding mechanism of the qualitative data captured by the open-ended question consists of two properties: differentiation and integration (Suedfeld & Tetlock, 1977), where the differentiation is the number of characteristics of an issue that an individual takes into account, and integration is more sophisticated connections among these dimensions / characteristics. The experiment will be designed in Qualtrics. A simple randomization will be applied in randomly assigning the respondents to either placebo group (pre-experimental questions + exposure to agreement + post-experimental questions; green lines in the figure below); or a treatment group (pre-experimental questions + exposure to disagreement + post-experimental questions; red lines in the figure below).", "q18": "United Kingdom, Chile", "q19":

We will analyze the impacts of both an article detailing the extent of discrimination against the respondent's pan-ethnic group as well as a video of a particular political figure--Donald Trump--making remarks about members of specific groups.
