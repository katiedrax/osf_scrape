participants\u2019 ratings of generic and specific statements. In the first study, the specifics were always explicitly contrasted with the generic statements. Also, the Study 1 task involved evaluating what generic and specific statements implied about a speaker. In this study, participants will read vignettes and then rate the accuracy of generic and specific statements. The vignettes and the statements describing them will either involve Structural properties or Stereotypical properties (i.e., inaccurate traits and values sometimes associated with Black people). Here we will also consider both \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 stereotypical generic statements (In Study 1, all generics about stereotypes were negatively valanced). \nHypotheses. \n1.\tWe suspect that without the pragmatic context the specific statements may be rated high across conditions. In a description of a specific event, a generic (\u201cBlack people face workplace discrimination\u201d) and specific (\u201cShe faced workplace discrimination\u201d) can both be accurate. This would underline the pragmatic implications of using specifics that explicitly deny generics or which tacitly deny them through their exclusion (as occurred in Study 1).  \n2.\tWe expected that the relative accuracy of generic and specific statements would differ by condition, such that participants will believe generic statements about structural regularities are more accurate than generic statements about traits and values. \n3.\tWe expected that this condition difference would be moderated by participant race and participant racism. We expected Black participants to show a particularly strong belief that generics about structural properties are accurate and generics about stereotypes are inaccurate. We expected this pattern of results (generics about structural properties as more accurate than generics about stereotypical properties) to be weakest in participants high in racism.  \nSample size. \nWe selected the same sample size as Study 1 based on the same rationale: 100 participants per condition (generics about structural properties, generics about stereotypes) per race (Black, White), to give us 95% power to detect medium effect sizes (d = .50). \nDesign and Procedure.\nParticipants will read 4 short descriptions of an individual. The stories evoked either structural forms of discrimination or evoked racial stereotypes (between subject). Participants were then asked to rate the accuracy of two statements: One that was generic and one that was specific (within subject). Participants then answered a battery of questions assessing racial bias: Symbolic racism, White-Black social dominance, and feeling thermometers. \n\n\n\nStimuli.\n[Short description]\nBelow you will see two ways of characterizing this event. Rate the accuracy of each of these descriptions of the event.\n\n[Generic] \n[Specific]\n\nScale: Very Inaccurate - Mostly inaccurate - Slightly inaccurate - Slightly accurate - Mostly accurate -Very accurate\n\nShort descriptions and generic / specific statements. \n\nStructural. \nA Black man received a text from his boss saying that his natural hair was unprofessional. He confronted his employer, who apologized. The following week he took a sick day; his boss called and told him he was being let go due to his poor work ethic.\n\"Black people face workplace discrimination.\"\n\"He faced workplace discrimination.\"\nA Black woman went to an expensive clothing store. The clerk followed her and assumed she did not belong. The clerk kept asking if she needed help and kept closely watching her when she said no.\n\u201cBlack people are treated with suspicion\u201d\n\u201cShe was treated with suspicion\u201d \nA Black woman arranged for her son to attend a school in the neighboring town. Although she did not live in that school's district, her relative did. On enrollment forms, she listed the address of her relative so that her son would qualify. When this was discovered, she was convicted of a felony and served jail time.\n\"Black people are treated unfairly by the criminal justice system.\"\n\"She was treated unfairly by the criminal justice system.\"\nA young Black man went to his guidance counselor. He had been performing reasonably well in school and wanted to attend university. His counselor began the discussion by talking about the military. When he said that's not what he wanted to do, she switched gears to discussing the local community college. She never explained how to apply to 4-year universities. He walked away unsure whether that was the right path for him.\n\"Black people are given fewer opportunities for success.\"\n\"He was given fewer opportunities for success.\"\nStereotypical.\nA Black man received a text from his boss saying that his work ethic was unprofessional. He was missing work every other week and was regularly late to meetings. At work, his boss often found him sitting at his desk with his legs up and his eyes closed. When his boss confronted him, he said that he didn't want to take work too seriously.\n\"Black people don't value hard work.\"\n\"He didn't value hard work.\"\nA Black woman had an income that was just sufficient to support herself and her family without having to worry too much. However, she took up huge amounts of credit card debt due to spending binges where she would buy expensive jewelry and state-of-the-art electronics.

In the first study, the specifics were always explicitly contrasted with the generic statements. Also, the Study 1 task involved evaluating what generic and specific statements implied about a speaker. In this study, participants will read vignettes and then rate the accuracy of generic and specific statements. The vignettes and the statements describing them will either involve Structural properties or Stereotypical properties (i.e., inaccurate traits and values sometimes associated with Black people). Here we will also consider both \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 stereotypical generic statements (In Study 1, all generics about stereotypes were negatively valanced). \nHypotheses. \n1.\tWe suspect that without the pragmatic context the specific statements may be rated high across conditions. In a description of a specific event, a generic (\u201cBlack people face workplace discrimination\u201d) and specific (\u201cShe faced workplace discrimination\u201d) can both be accurate. This would underline the pragmatic implications of using specifics that explicitly deny generics or which tacitly deny them through their exclusion (as occurred in Study 1).  \n2.\tWe expected that the relative accuracy of generic and specific statements would differ by condition, such that participants will believe generic statements about structural regularities are more accurate than generic statements about traits and values. \n3.\tWe expected that this condition difference would be moderated by participant race and participant racism. We expected Black participants to show a particularly strong belief that generics about structural properties are accurate and generics about stereotypes are inaccurate. We expected this pattern of results (generics about structural properties as more accurate than generics about stereotypical properties) to be weakest in participants high in racism.  \nSample size. \nWe selected the same sample size as Study 1 based on the same rationale: 100 participants per condition (generics about structural properties, generics about stereotypes) per race (Black, White), to give us 95% power to detect medium effect sizes (d = .50). \nDesign and Procedure.\nParticipants will read 4 short descriptions of an individual. The stories evoked either structural forms of discrimination or evoked racial stereotypes (between subject). Participants were then asked to rate the accuracy of two statements: One that was generic and one that was specific (within subject). Participants then answered a battery of questions assessing racial bias: Symbolic racism, White-Black social dominance, and feeling thermometers. \n\n\n\nStimuli.\n[Short description]\nBelow you will see two ways of characterizing this event. Rate the accuracy of each of these descriptions of the event.\n\n[Generic] \n[Specific]\n\nScale: Very Inaccurate - Mostly inaccurate - Slightly inaccurate - Slightly accurate - Mostly accurate -Very accurate\n\nShort descriptions and generic / specific statements. \n\nStructural. \nA Black man received a text from his boss saying that his natural hair was unprofessional.

Only if their answer is \"yes,\" we will ask them how much they are willing to pay for the information.", "q4": "We predict that supervisor-participants' willingness to pay is lower under a two-stage process in the extension than under a one-stage process in the replication.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We send out an invitation to participate in the experiment via e-mail to everyone registered in the subject pool. Participants can self-select into sessions via an opt-in system. Hence, participation is voluntary. We pay participants based on their choices in a similar fashion to the original study conducted by Maas et al (2012 The Accounting Review).
