The legislature rejected the governor\u2019s proposal, and the votes were as follows: Yes No Yes No Governor\u2019s Party 40 0 Governor\u2019s Party 40 0 Opposition Party 0 60 Opposition Party 5 55 Total 40 60 Total 45 55 Yes No Governor\u2019s Party 40 0 Opposition Party 9 51 Total 49 51 We are interested in how likely you would be to vote for the governor\u2019s reelection. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely and 10 is very likely, how likely would you be to vote for the governor? We are also interested in how likely you would be to vote for legislative candidates of the two parties. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely and 10 is very likely, how likely would you be to vote for the governor\u2019s party\u2019s legislative candidates? On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely and 10 is very likely, how likely would you be to vote for the opposition party\u2019s legislative candidates? I plan to have all of these questions visible on the same page so that respondents know they have to rate both the governor and the legislature. After the treatment question, respondents will be asked demographic questions about their party affiliation, gender, age, education, and ethnicity. These will be used to check for heterogeneous treatment effects, though none are expected. I plan to have around 500 respondents per treatment group for a total of 3,000 respondents in the experiment. Before the full scale experiment, I will pilot it with a smaller number of respondents.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26":

Survey Experiment 1 Version 1: When you go to vote, there are laws to make sure that your vote is completely secret. You vote in a screened compartment that keeps anyone from seeing how you vote and your choice is not seen by anyone, not other voters, polling officials, or election commission staff. Even if you cannot read or write, you can still vote in secret.Your employer cannot find out about which party or candidate you voted for.

You vote in a screened compartment that keeps anyone from seeing how you vote and your choice is not seen by anyone, not other voters, polling officials, or election commission staff.

The second survey experiment asks both about approval for petitioning the government and more extra-institutional political actions (protests and strikes) set against different frames that express different concerns: personal concerns for safety or wages versus larger concerns for the impact on the national economy or the industry job market. There is no explicit control version, however, workers outside the garment industry provide an important control group for the responses of workers in the garment industry. Survey experiment 2 Respondents were asked the following two questions, preceded by one of the frames listed below the questions. How much do you agree with the following statements: Workers in the garment industry and others like it should organize and, potentially, go on strikes or hold protest to demand higher wages and better working conditions (Strongly agree to Strongly Disagree, 5 point scale) Workers in the garment industry and others like it should lobby the government for laws that dictate better working conditions and/or better pay. (Strongly agree to Strongly Disagree, 5 point scale) Version 1: In 2013 a factory where workers sew clothing collapsed in Mumbai, killing at least one person, and injuring some people. Investigation revealed that there was unauthorized construction at the building. Version 2: The garment industry represents 14% of industrial activity and 17% of export income in India. It provides jobs for almost 35 million workers in India. It is vitally important to the overall economy of the country. Problems with workers could disrupt production in this industry. Version 3: Many international companies have workers in India sew clothing for them because it is less expensive for workers in India to make the clothing than for workers elsewhere to do it. If wages go up, some of these companies might have their clothing made in a different country. Version 4: The garment industry represents 14% of industrial activity and 17% of export income in India.

If specific concerns about pressure from employers are more salient to workers in the garment industry, then the reported likelihood of voting should be different among the group for whom their employer is mentioned specifically. If increased earning power or increased risk changes these workers responsiveness to family pressures, then the likelihood of voting amid women receiving version two may differ from the control group. Survey Experiment 1 Version 1: When you go to vote, there are laws to make sure that your vote is completely secret. You vote in a screened compartment that keeps anyone from seeing how you vote and your choice is not seen by anyone, not other voters, polling officials, or election commission staff. Even if you cannot read or write, you can still vote in secret.Your employer cannot find out about which party or candidate you voted for. How likely do you think you are to vote in the next election? Version 2: When you go to vote, there are laws to make sure that your vote is completely secret. You vote in a screened compartment that keeps anyone from seeing how you vote and your choice is not seen by anyone, not other voters, polling officials, or election commission staff. Even if you cannot read or write, you can still vote in secret. No one in your family can find out about which party or candidate you voted for. How likely do you think you are to vote in the next election? Version 3: When you go to vote, there are laws to make sure that your vote is completely secret. You vote in a screened compartment that keeps anyone from seeing how you vote and your choice is not seen by anyone, not other voters, polling officials, or election commission staff. Even if you cannot read or write, you can still vote in secret. How likely do you think you are to vote in the next election? Version 4: How likely do you think you are to vote in the next election? The second survey experiment asks both about approval for petitioning the government and more extra-institutional political actions (protests and strikes) set against different frames that express different concerns: personal concerns for safety or wages versus larger concerns for the impact on the national economy or the industry job market. There is no explicit control version, however, workers outside the garment industry provide an important control group for the responses of workers in the garment industry. Survey experiment 2 Respondents were asked the following two questions, preceded by one of the frames listed below the questions. How much do you agree with the following statements: Workers in the garment industry and others like it should organize and, potentially, go on strikes or hold protest to demand higher wages and better working conditions (Strongly agree to Strongly Disagree, 5 point scale) Workers in the garment industry and others like it should lobby the government for laws that dictate better working conditions and/or better pay. (Strongly agree to Strongly Disagree, 5 point scale) Version 1: In 2013 a factory where workers sew clothing collapsed in Mumbai, killing at least one person, and injuring some people. Investigation revealed that there was unauthorized construction at the building. Version 2: The garment industry represents 14% of industrial activity and 17% of export income in India. It provides jobs for almost 35 million workers in India. It is vitally important to the overall economy of the country. Problems with workers could disrupt production in this industry. Version 3: Many international companies have workers in India sew clothing for them because it is less expensive for workers in India to make the clothing than for workers elsewhere to do it. If wages go up, some of these companies might have their clothing made in a different country. Version 4: The garment industry represents 14% of industrial activity and 17% of export income in India. It provides jobs for 35 million workers in India. The garment industry is vitally important to the overall economy of the country, but workers in the garment industry are paid little and work long hours in poor conditions.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "",
