Nonetheless, traditional gender conceptions revolving around women as victims rather than agents continue to have traction and have halted the internalization and undermined the universality of norms promoting women\u2019s agency. As a result, global gender norms are activated and implemented unevenly. We designed a vignette experiment to test our theoretical expectation that global norms of women\u2019s participation are more likely to be activated when a conflict emerges as visibly gendered in terms of prevalent sexual violence. We suggest that sexual violence serves as a heuristic for international actors in determining the gendered nature of a conflict, due to the massive increase in global awareness of this type of violence.

At the same time, wartime sexual violence rose on the global agenda in the wake of the genocide in Rwanda and the civil war in Bosnia. Media coverage of conflict-related sexual violence has since increased rapidly. These developments have had two consequences: 1) sexual violence is increasingly viewed as a grave problem in conflict and 2) normative contention has arisen between women's protection and women's participation prescriptions, to the detriment of the latter. Accordingly, the notion that gender matters in a variety of ways and that women\u2019s participation is a necessity in all (post-)conflict settings has not been internalized by the majority of international actors and observers. Even though virtually all conflicts are highly gendered in different dimensions \u2013 e.g. male-dominated fighting and the disproportionate displacement of women \u2013 sexual violence has come to be seen as the foremost issue affecting women in conflict situations. In other words, a conflict is considerably less likely to be perceived as gendered in the absence of documented widespread sexual violence, and hence less likely to elicit a \"gendered response\" by international actors and observes. This yields an expectation of the uneven activation of global gender norms: H1: Respondents are more likely to support international intervention in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with overall widespread violence. H2: Respondents are more likely to acknowledge the importance of enhancing women\u2019s participation in peace processes in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with overall widespread violence. We are further interested in the relationship between ethnic and sexual violence. We seek to explore if \u2013 as has been suggested in the existing literature on the inclusion of groups in peace agreements (Bell and O\u2019Rourke 2010) \u2013 ethnic violence sidelines gender concerns. Previous literature has dedicated very little time and space to the question of whether ethnic concerns crowd out gender concerns. This part of our experimental design is therefore somewhat more exploratory and may lead to a more rigorous and detailed follow-up study. We expect that: H3: Respondents are more likely to support international intervention in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with widespread ethnic violence. H4: Respondents are more likely to acknowledge the importance of enhancing women\u2019s participation in peace processes in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with widespread ethnic violence. Finally, we introduce in the Swedish experiment a second moving part in the form of expressed concern about the escalating violence by Nordic partners. Given the high attention to gender concerns in the foreign policies of the more gender-equal Nordic states, we are curious whether the positioning of Nordic partners with regards to the conflict-related sexual violence has any effect on acknowledging the importance of enhancing women\u2019s participation in peace processes. Here, we have a weak expectation of a positive interaction effect between a widespread sexual violence conflict and expressed concern by Nordic partners: H5: Respondents are more likely to acknowledge the importance of enhancing women\u2019s participation in peace processes in a conflict with widespread sexual violence compared to a conflict with overall widespread violence, especially if Nordic partners express concern about the escalating violence.

conflict, such analogies break down on a number of fronts. In particular, cyber incidents that affect national security and political integrity lack uniformity in how they manifest. A nuclear weapon presents as a singular threat in the form of a promised, massive detonation; a cyber attack, by contrast, might take advantage of vulnerability across the gamut of information technology usage for diverse effects. As a result, the reactions of decision-makers to cyber events and to cyber-enabled versions of traditional conflict are poorly understood. This is particularly the case because of the manner in which cyber conflict incidents can simultaneously present as threatening to national security and menacing to citizenry (i.e. such as when attacks on government systems serve to both signal foreign intent and compromise private information). Our study attempts to better understand the determinants of decision-making where cyber incidents prompt foreign policy response. We aim to assess several dynamics centered on a variation of the details of cyber conflict with the seminal Mindset Theory of Action Phases as our guiding framework. The theory holds that individuals often, when presented with evidence of impending threat and/or need for action, transition from a \u201cdeliberative\u201d mindset to an \u201cimplemental\u201d one. In doing so, they adopt a range of cognitive biases related to information processing, updating and task expectations.

In particular, cyber incidents that affect national security and political integrity lack uniformity in how they manifest. A nuclear weapon presents as a singular threat in the form of a promised, massive detonation; a cyber attack, by contrast, might take advantage of vulnerability across the gamut of information technology usage for diverse effects. As a result, the reactions of decision-makers to cyber events and to cyber-enabled versions of traditional conflict are poorly understood. This is particularly the case because of the manner in which cyber conflict incidents can simultaneously present as threatening to national security and menacing to citizenry (i.e. such as when attacks on government systems serve to both signal foreign intent and compromise private information). Our study attempts to better understand the determinants of decision-making where cyber incidents prompt foreign policy response. We aim to assess several dynamics centered on a variation of the details of cyber conflict with the seminal Mindset Theory of Action Phases as our guiding framework. The theory holds that individuals often, when presented with evidence of impending threat and/or need for action, transition from a \u201cdeliberative\u201d mindset to an \u201cimplemental\u201d one. In doing so, they adopt a range of cognitive biases related to information processing, updating and task expectations.

needed to provide public services, and it encourages citizens to demand effective and responsive governments (Huntington 1991; Ross 2004; Paler 2013). Yet, many developing countries are trapped in a vicious cycle in which governments are unresponsive and unaccountable, the provision of quality public services is lacking, and tax compliance is low. A vast scholarship has studied why some individuals comply with their taxes, and others do not. Yet, much of this work has focused on developed countries. Hence, the lessons learned may be specific to countries where citizens should expect that the government will use tax revenues to deliver public services, and that they are visible, or \"legible\" (Scott, 1998), to the state through civil and commercial registration systems. In developing countries, in contrast, government use of tax revenues to provide services may be questionable. The informal sector also remains very large in developing countries (McKenzie and Woodruff 2013), often with a majority of small businesses operating in the informal sector of the economy, millions of people living in informal settlements, and a disproportionate number of households lacking formal access to public services. In this context, could formalization trigger a chain of effects that has governments respond by providing services, and then culminates in an increase in tax compliance? Like tax compliance, a citizen's decision to formalize its relation with the state seems to be the result of a comparison of the expected benefits of formalization to its expected costs (Perry, et al. 2007; McKenzie and Sakho 2010; Neuwirth 2011). In the case of formalization, however, costs not only include future tax liability but, in many cases, include a costly and complex process. People in the informal sector may lack the information, time, and resources (financial and human capital) to navigate the bureaucracy and oftentimes arcane regulations. Moreover, in many cases, citizens are not certain that benefits of formalization will materialize. Then, the high costs of the process of formalization and its uncertain benefits may deter citizens from transitioning to the formal sector. Experimental work on the topic has found that interventions that only provide information about the process of registration, including its benefits, have no effect on firms' decision to formalize (Andrade et al. 2013; De Giorgi and Rahman 2013; Bruhn and McKenzie 2014). More expensive interventions, such as cash payments or business training, lead to higher rates of formalization (De Mel et al. 2013; Benhassine et al. 2016), but these are not cost-effective interventions, and they may not produce durable effects (Galiani et al. 2016). Finally, a few studies have shown that interventions that offered information about the process of formalization and assistance to people to undergo such process lead to higher rates of formalization (Campos et al. 2015; Benhassine et al. 2016; Galiani et al. 2016). However, the generalizability of these studies may limited. In Benhassine et al. (2016)'s and Galiani et al. (2016)'s studies, samples were drawn from Benin's largest city (Cotonou), and Colombia's capital city (Bogota). In Campos et al. (2015)'s study, the sample included firms with larger revenues (25 percentile and above), with a fixed location, with more than one person working in the business, and with at least one worker contracted outside of family members and business owners. Hence, these studies show that in large cities, and among more profitable firms, there may be a latent demand for formalization, which is blocked by transaction costs. Yet, it is unclear whether the effects of the bundled treatment of information and assistance could be generalized to small- and mid- size firms outside of urban centers. Moreover, these studies have focused on the process of formalization of a business, which may not produce generalizable lessons for other formalization processes, such as the acquisition of a land title, or the formal access to basic public services. The six projects in this Metaketa, and our meta-analysis, aim to contribute to this literature by studying the effects of a common treatment arm, to be implemented in a consistent manner by all projects, which combines information about the process of formalization, its benefits and costs, as well as assistance and/or subsidies to remove transaction-cost type barriers that impede those who otherwise wish to formalize to do so. Although the contexts of the projects are different, spanning from Colombia to India, in all cases preliminary field work by PIs suggests that there is a latent high demand for the formalization processes included in this Metaketa, which is probably driven by the tangible benefits associated with them, including the possibility to access valuable public services. Moreover, in all cases citizens pay costs of remaining in the informal sector, including unofficial payments, dependence on non-state utilities providers that extract high rates in exchange for low quality services, uncertainty, and fear of government repression. We will explore if the common treatment arm, which will encourage citizens to formalize its relation with the state, helps establish a fiscal contract between citizens and their governments, whereby local governments deliver public goods in exchange for tax compliance (Levi 1989; Tyler 1990; Levi and Sacks 2009; Paler 2013; Ali et al. 2014)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our primary hypotheses are: 1) Common treatment arm increases citizen's intent to formalize, and ultimately increases formalization of, their relationship with the government. 2) Common treatment arm increases citizen's access to public services tightly related to the formalization process, and reduces reliance on non-public providers of such services. 3) Common treatment arm increases citizen's tax compliance (i.e. payment of taxes or dues for services provided) directly related to the process of formalization. We also have a set of secondary hypotheses that are not directly involved on the process of formalization, but that could be impacted as a result of a citizen formalizing its relation with the state, becoming a tax payer (in specific tax domain related to formalization), and experiencing public service provision (or lack thereof): 1) Common treatment arm improves citizen's attitudes towards the government. 2) Common treatment arm increases civic and political participation. 3) Common treatment arm increases citizen's access to other public services. 4) Common treatment arm improves citizen's tax morale more generally, and increases willingness to pay taxes not directly involved with the formalization process. 5) Common treatment arm affects perceptions about prevalence of non-compliance with taxation, as well as probability of being caught not paying taxes, and the severity of the punishment associated with it. Finally, we expect that some baseline covariates will act as moderators, including: benefits of formalization, baseline attitudes towards the government, and baseline access to public goods. Secondary moderators include: gender, education and income, and resident versus migrant status."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "First, for each study, we will report the effect size (as reported by the PIs), the precision with which the effect size has been estimated in that study (95% confidence intervals and p-values), and the number of observations.

governments with resources needed to provide public services, and it encourages citizens to demand effective and responsive governments (Huntington 1991; Ross 2004; Paler 2013). Yet, many developing countries are trapped in a vicious cycle in which governments are unresponsive and unaccountable, the provision of quality public services is lacking, and tax compliance is low. A vast scholarship has studied why some individuals comply with their taxes, and others do not. Yet, much of this work has focused on developed countries. Hence, the lessons learned may be specific to countries where citizens should expect that the government will use tax revenues to deliver public services, and that they are visible, or \"legible\" (Scott, 1998), to the state through civil and commercial registration systems. In developing countries, in contrast, government use of tax revenues to provide services may be questionable. The informal sector also remains very large in developing countries (McKenzie and Woodruff 2013), often with a majority of small businesses operating in the informal sector of the economy, millions of people living in informal settlements, and a disproportionate number of households lacking formal access to public services. In this context, could formalization trigger a chain of effects that has governments respond by providing services, and then culminates in an increase in tax compliance? Like tax compliance, a citizen's decision to formalize its relation with the state seems to be the result of a comparison of the expected benefits of formalization to its expected costs (Perry, et al. 2007; McKenzie and Sakho 2010; Neuwirth 2011). In the case of formalization, however, costs not only include future tax liability but, in many cases, include a costly and complex process. People in the informal sector may lack the information, time, and resources (financial and human capital) to navigate the bureaucracy and oftentimes arcane regulations. Moreover, in many cases, citizens are not certain that benefits of formalization will materialize. Then, the high costs of the process of formalization and its uncertain benefits may deter citizens from transitioning to the formal sector. Experimental work on the topic has found that interventions that only provide information about the process of registration, including its benefits, have no effect on firms' decision to formalize (Andrade et al. 2013; De Giorgi and Rahman 2013; Bruhn and McKenzie 2014). More expensive interventions, such as cash payments or business training, lead to higher rates of formalization (De Mel et al. 2013; Benhassine et al. 2016), but these are not cost-effective interventions, and they may not produce durable effects (Galiani et al. 2016). Finally, a few studies have shown that interventions that offered information about the process of formalization and assistance to people to undergo such process lead to higher rates of formalization (Campos et al. 2015; Benhassine et al. 2016; Galiani et al. 2016). However, the generalizability of these studies may limited. In Benhassine et al. (2016)'s and Galiani et al. (2016)'s studies, samples were drawn from Benin's largest city (Cotonou), and Colombia's capital city (Bogota). In Campos et al. (2015)'s study, the sample included firms with larger revenues (25 percentile and above), with a fixed location, with more than one person working in the business, and with at least one worker contracted outside of family members and business owners. Hence, these studies show that in large cities, and among more profitable firms, there may be a latent demand for formalization, which is blocked by transaction costs. Yet, it is unclear whether the effects of the bundled treatment of information and assistance could be generalized to small- and mid- size firms outside of urban centers. Moreover, these studies have focused on the process of formalization of a business, which may not produce generalizable lessons for other formalization processes, such as the acquisition of a land title, or the formal access to basic public services. The six projects in this Metaketa, and our meta-analysis, aim to contribute to this literature by studying the effects of a common treatment arm, to be implemented in a consistent manner by all projects, which combines information about the process of formalization, its benefits and costs, as well as assistance and/or subsidies to remove transaction-cost type barriers that impede those who otherwise wish to formalize to do so. Although the contexts of the projects are different, spanning from Colombia to India, in all cases preliminary field work by PIs suggests that there is a latent high demand for the formalization processes included in this Metaketa, which is probably driven by the tangible benefits associated with them, including the possibility to access valuable public services. Moreover, in all cases citizens pay costs of remaining in the informal sector, including unofficial payments, dependence on non-state utilities providers that extract high rates in exchange for low quality services, uncertainty, and fear of government repression. We will explore if the common treatment arm, which will encourage citizens to formalize its relation with the state, helps establish a fiscal contract between citizens and their governments, whereby local governments deliver public goods in exchange for tax compliance (Levi 1989; Tyler 1990; Levi and Sacks 2009; Paler 2013; Ali et al. 2014).", "q16": "Our primary hypotheses are: 1) Common treatment arm increases citizen's intent to formalize, and ultimately increases formalization of, their relationship with the government. 2) Common treatment arm increases citizen's access to public services tightly related to the formalization process, and reduces reliance on non-public providers of such services. 3) Common treatment arm increases citizen's tax compliance (i.e. payment of taxes or dues for services provided) directly related to the process of formalization. We also have a set of secondary hypotheses that are not directly involved on the process of formalization, but that could be impacted as a result of a citizen formalizing its relation with the state, becoming a tax payer (in specific tax domain related to formalization), and experiencing public service provision (or lack thereof): 1) Common treatment arm improves citizen's attitudes towards the government. 2) Common treatment arm increases civic and political participation. 3) Common treatment arm increases citizen's access to other public services. 4) Common treatment arm improves citizen's tax morale more generally, and increases willingness to pay taxes not directly involved with the formalization process. 5) Common treatment arm affects perceptions about prevalence of non-compliance with taxation, as well as probability of being caught not paying taxes, and the severity of the punishment associated with it. Finally, we expect that some baseline covariates will act as moderators, including: benefits of formalization, baseline attitudes towards the government, and baseline access to public goods. Secondary moderators include: gender, education and income, and resident versus migrant status.", "q17": "First, for each study, we will report the effect size (as reported by the PIs), the precision with which the effect size has been estimated in that study (95% confidence intervals and p-values), and the number of observations. Second, we will estimate the ITT effects of the common treatment arm on outcomes via OLS. We will control for study fixed effects, and for any strata used in the individual studies to perform block randomization. Robust standard errors will be clustered at the level of randomization.\u00a0We will also report a precision-weighted estimation (i.e., the weights will be specified as the inverse of the squared standard errors) (Borenstein et al. 2009). [fn]As diagnostics, we will also look a the relationship between each study's effect size and sample size.[/fn] We will also report the Complier Average Causal Effects, where we will use assignment to treatment as an instrument for formalization. The CACE approximates the effects of formalization on tax compliance, access to public services, tax morale, and attitudes towards the state. To assess whether our results are robust to departures from the strict exogenity assumption, we will derive analytical bounds for our estimations (Conley at al. 2012; Nevo and Rosen 2012).", "q18":

This poses serious problems for representative democracy. Even if elected officials want to correctly reflect citizens' preferences, they will fail because they lack the requisite information. What happens when this information problem is overcome? We plan to conduct a randomized field experiment in which thousands of state legislators are randomly assigned to receive high-quality public policy polling data gleaned from the CCES on their constituents\u2019 preferences. We will then measure whether this information corrects elected officials\u2019 misperceptions, whether this changes their personal policy preferences, and whether this changes their expected voting behavior on these policies."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We can only evaluate effects on those legislators for which sufficient CCES data is available. Prior to the intervention, we will randomly assign 2,390 state legislators to: 50% of legislators to see the polling only of their region 50% of legislators to see the polling of their specific district There are 8 possible issues for which legislators can receive polling information: immigration, crime, environment, gun control, abortion, minimum wage, transit, and healthcare. Each legislator is randomly assigned to receive polling information on 4 of these 8 issues. We will block by party of legislator and whether on certain issues districts are \u201cout of sync,\u201d in terms of the relationship between their constituents\u2019 preferences and their voting behavior. We define a legislator as being \u201cout of sync\u201d if a majority of constituents support the liberal (conservative) side of an issue but the representative is a Republican (Democrat). We then compress this into 3 groups: 0-1 issues (33%), 2-5 issues (28%), 6-8 issues (39%). We block by these groups and party (all legislators in our sample are either Democrats or Republicans). Of the eight issues we have data on, we will only show four to each legislator, randomly assigning which set of issues each legislator sees. This study is comprised of four stages: Pre-intervention: As part of an omnibus survey, a subset of U.S. state legislators will receive questions asking them to estimate their districts\u2019 responses to the CCES policy questions. This message will not be directly identified as related to the researchers or their institutional affiliations. These responses will serve as pre-treatment covariates in our analyses. For any legislator not included in this pre-intervention survey, we will impute the mean value by the legislator\u2019s party and generate an indicator for a missing pre-treatment variable. Intervention: Legislators will receive an invitation from \u201cDistrict Pulse,\u201d an organization created by the researchers, to view data and maps showing them the preferences of their districts on the aforementioned CCES policy questions. When receiving this invitation, legislators will receive a unique username and password. Legislators will be invited to District Pulse via email and follow-up phone calls. We will track which legislators access the website to identify compliers. Post-treatment survey: Legislators will receive an invitation from George Washington University, from a researcher not affiliated with stages 1 and 2, to complete a survey in which they are asked to estimate their districts\u2019 responses to the CCES policy questions. Legislators will be invited to participate in this survey via email and follow-up phone calls. All legislators who receive the intervention will receive the survey. Post-treatment behavioral outcomes: For states in which more than 50 legislators accessed District Pulse (compliers), we will evaluate whether the intervention affected legislators\u2019 voting behavior on the issues. We will be able to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Providing legislators with district-specific polling on an issue will make their perceptions of district support on that issue more accurate. Hypothesis 2: Providing legislators with district-specific polling on an issue will make them more supportive of the majority position in their district. Hypothesis 3: Providing legislators with district-specific polling on an issue will make their voting behavior on that issue more aligned with their districts\u2019 preferences. Hypothesis 4: Legislators who are provided with district-specific polling on issues on which they are out of sync with their constituents will be more supportive of the majority position in their district, compared to legislators who are provided with regional polling on issues on which they are out of sync."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "To evaluate Hypothesis 1, for each issue, we will regress the absolute value of the difference between the legislators\u2019 estimate of their constituents\u2019 preferences and their actual preferences, on treatment assignment. To evaluate Hypothesis 3, six months after the debut of District Pulse, we will compile the roll call votes of states where at least 50 legislators were compliers. We will then look for keywords in legislation within those states to identify legislation related to the issue areas. We will then code that legislation in relationship to the CCES (i.e., does support for the legislation evince support for the CCES issue?). We will again estimate two sets of models as described. In this case, the dependent variable will be probability that a legislator\u2019s roll call vote matches his or her district\u2019s preferences. For each model, we will include legislators\u2019 responses from Stage 1 as baseline covariate information. For legislators who do not respond at Stage 1, we will include an indicator for missingness, and assign them an imputed value. The imputed value will be the mean response of co-partisan respondents in the same Census region. Model details: Form a \u201clong\u201d dataset where each row is a legislator-issue with a treatment indicator for whether the legislator received district polling on that issue (coded as 2); regional polling (coded as 1); no polling (coded as 0). Run the model: reg dv i.treat COVARS, cluster(legislator) Where COVARS are state fixed effects, indicators for whether the legislator is a Democrat or Republican, indicator for upper vs lower chamber, 2016 Trump vote share in the district, and (where available) baseline responses from the first wave survey.

However, the effects of a celebrity appeal as a donation strategy, especially in the context of international organizations, has not yet been addressed.

Many IOs partner with celebrity Goodwill Ambassadors to bring more attention and funding to the causes IOs support but we don't know how effective such public appeal strategies actually are, which this study will help to start understanding.
