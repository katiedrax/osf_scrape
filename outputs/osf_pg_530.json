After learning the first list (referred to as L1), participants are either instructed to forget or to continue remembering this list before learning list 2 (L2). In a memory test for both lists (regardless of the forget or remember condition), two findings can be observed: Participants in the forget condition recall fewer L1 items (L1 forgetting) and more L2 items (L2 enhancement) as compared to the remember condition.\n\nRecent studies provided first evidence that typical findings on retrieval-induced forgetting and effects of DF on subsequent learning extend to motor memory (in particular, motor sequences, Tempel, Aslan, &amp; Frings, 2016; Tempel &amp; Frings, 2013, 2016) and stimulus-response (S-R) associations (Dreisbach &amp; B\u00e4uml, 2014). The current study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the DF effect on not explicitly instructed and implicitly tested S-R associations. For this, we will investigate whether (not explicitly instructed) learned S-R associations can be intentionally forgotten by employing a DF paradigm that allows the simultaneous measurement of S-R retrieval. \n\n\nOur study will consist of three major phases: A learning phase, a distraction phase, and a test phase. \n\nDuring the learning phase, the participants\u2019 task is to categorize images of objects of two lists (L1 and L2) as containing a mechanism or not and to remember the images. Extending the DF paradigm to S-R mappings using an arbitrary categorization task (drawing on an item-specific priming paradigm; Hsu &amp; Waszak, 2012; Moutsopoulou, Yang, Desantis, &amp; Waszak, 2015; Pfeuffer, Moutsopoulou, Pfister, Waszak, &amp; Kiesel, 2017), this will enable participants to learn S-R associations (stimulus-action, S-A, associations according to the terminology provided by Moutsopoulou et al., 2015). Importantly, whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus differs across the stimuli and is indicated by a task-cue regarding the classification-response mapping prior to the stimulus presentation. For example, the task cue \u201cM + N\u201d indicates that an object image has to be classified as mechanic by pressing a left key and a right key for the classification \u201cnon-mechanic\u201d. Conversely, the task cue \u201cN +M\u201d indicates that a right key press is required for mechanic objects and a left key press for non-mechanic ones.\n\nBetween L1 and L2, half of the participants will be instructed to forget the objects of L1 using a cover-story (forget condition). The other half of the participants will be told to continue remembering the objects and to proceed to the second list (remember condition).\nFollowing a distractor task, participants solve a visual working memory task for three minutes to spurge short-term memory.\n\nIn the test phase, participants are presented with all the object images from the learning phase (L1 and L2 regardless of the remember or forget condition) and new object images. Participants are again instructed to classify objects as containing a mechanism or not. However, for half of the old objects (presented in the learning phase), the S-R associations are the same as they had been in the learning phase (Response repetitions). For the other half of the old objects, the S-R associations are the opposite of what they had been in the learning phase (item-specific response switches). \n\nResponse switches are therefore defined as item-specific switches of the item-specific S-R mappings between the learning (object requires a left key press in the four learning trials of the learning phase ) and the test phase (object requires a right key press in the one test trial of the test phase ). Response repetitions are in turn defined as item-specific repetitions between the learning (object requires a left key press in the four learning trials of the learning phase) and the test phase (object also requires a left key press in the one test trial of the test phase), respectively. \n\nWe then use the difference in response times, RTs, and error rates between trials that require a response switch and response repetition trials as a measure of how DF affects both the formation of novel S-R associations as well as how already formed, competing or not competing, S-R associations may or may not influence the responses given in the test phase.\n\nIn a typical memory test for L1 and L2 in the list-method of DF, two findings can be observed: Participants in the forget condition recall fewer L1 items (L1 forgetting) and more L2 items (L2 enhancement) as compared to the remember condition.\n\nApplying these observations to the context of S-R associations we expect the following observations: If DF influences the persisting activation of the competing S-R associations, the performance difference between response repetition and switch trials should be smaller in the forget as compared with the remember condition for to-be-forgotten L1 items (L1 forgetting). If DF enhances the learning of novel S-R associations, then, the performance difference between response repetition and switch trials should be greater in the forget as compared with the remember condition for L2 items (L2 enhancement).\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Item-specific repetition priming effects describe a typical decrease in RTs and error rates for item-specific response repetitions (see the introduction) between learning phase and test phase trials as compared to response switches. If item-specific S-R associations are formed during the learning phase and are automatically retrieved in the test trial, responses during the test phase should be slower and les accurate for response switches as compared to response repetitions. However, we expect, that in the forget condition, these item-specific repetition priming effects are reduced for items from the to-be-forgotten list 1 (L1) and increased for list 2 (L2):\n\nH1a (L1 forgetting): The item-specific repetition priming effect of RTs (increased RTs for response switches as compared to response repetitions in the test phase) for L1 stimuli is smaller in the forget condition as compared with the remember condition. \n\nH1b (L1 forgetting): The item-specific repetition priming effect of error rates for L1 stimuli (increased error rates for response switches as compared to response repetitions in the test phase) is smaller in the forget condition as compared with the remember condition. \n\nH2a (L2 enhancement): The item-specific repetition priming effect of RTs in the test phase for L2 stimuli is stronger in the forget as compared to the remember condition. \n\nH2b (L2 enhancement): The item-specific repetition priming effect of error rates in the test phase for L2 associations is stronger in the forget as compared to the remember condition."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Images of objects serve as stimuli and denote everyday objects. The participants\u2019 task is to classify the stimuli as containing a mechanism or not (\u201cmechanisch\u201d, Engl. mechanical and \u201cnicht-mechanisch\u201d, Engl. nonmechanical) using a left or right response key. \n\nThe trial structure is as follows: First, a fixation cross is presented (700 ms) including a task-cue that indicates whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus. For example, the task-cue \u201cM + N\u201d indicates that an object image has to be classified as \u201cmechanic\u201d by pressing a left key and a right key for the classification \u201cnon-mechanic\u201d. Conversely, the task cue \u201cN +M\u201d indicates that a right key press is required for mechanic objects and a left key press for non-mechanic ones.\n\nThen, the stimulus (the image of an object) follows. Participants are instructed to classify the object as containing a mechanism or not by pressing the response key (left vs. right) that spatially corresponds to previously presented task-cue mapping. Objects are displayed until a response (classifications via left/right key presses) is given but for a maximum of 2000 ms. Next, a feedback screen is presented informing participants about their response\u00b4s correctness (500 ms; \u201crichtig!\u201d/ Eng: \u201ccorrect!\u201d for correct responses; \u201cFehler!\u201d/ Eng.: \u201cerror!\u201d for incorrect responses). Responses that are outside the response frame are aborted with corresponding feedback (\u201czu langsam!\u201d/ Eng: \u201ctoo slow!\u201d, 500 ms).\n\nImportantly, whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus differs across the stimuli as indicated the task-cue. Thereby, for each specific item participants learn item-specific associations between each stimulus (object image) and the corresponding response (left or right key-press): The participants learns items-specific S-R associations (stimulus-action, S-A, associations according to the terminology provided by Moutsopoulou et al., 2015). \n\nIn order to build stronger S-R associations, each stimulus is presented four times with the same S R mapping in the learning phases.\n\nParticipants are randomly assigned to either the remember condition or the forget condition (38 each). As described, there are three major phases: A learning phase (consisting of L1 and L2 as well as the remember/ forget instruction in-between L1 and L2), a distraction phase, and a test phase.  \n\nInstructions are given on the screen and summarized by an experimenter. After receiving the instructions regarding the classification task (see task description), participants are told to also remember the images of objects they classify. Crucially, participants are not instructed to learn any associations between the images and their responses.\n\nIn a practise block consisting of eight additional object images, participants are familiarized with the task.\n\nLearning phase. The learning phase consists of two lists, list 1 (L1) and list 2 (L2) enabling participants to learn (not explicitly instructed) stimulus-response (S-R) associations. \nIn total, they respond to 32 objects in L1 (presented 4 times, thus, 128 trials), 32 different objects in L2 (presented 4 times, thus, 128 trials). In L1 and L2, each stimulus is paired with the corresponding response four times: L1 and L2 each consist of four blocks and in each block the stimuli of the corresponding list are presented once (and thus four times in total).\n\nFirst, participants respond to all items in L1 in the four corresponding blocks. After and in-between L1 and L2, half of the participants are either instructed to forget or to remember L1. Thus, for participants in the forget condition, L1 consists of to-be-forgotten items (to measure L1 forgetting) and L2 of to-be-remembered items (to measure L2 enhancement). For the remember condition, both L1 and L2 consist of to-be-remembered items. \n\nForget-condition: After L1 is learned, participants in the forget condition are instructed to forget the so-far-presented items. For this, after L1, a computer screen gives an arbitrary overview of the participant\u2019s performance and the current condition group the experiment was in. The participants are asked to go to the experimenter in order to continue the experiment in the next condition group. The experimenter then steps in, reads over the summary and apologizes for having accidentally started the experiment in the incorrect condition group. Thereupon, the experimenter leaves the room pretending to ask the leading researcher what to do next. The experimenter re-enters the room and informs the participants that they could restart the experiment in the correct condition group. The participants are kindly asked to start over again with the correct condition group. The participants are casually told to try to forget what they had just done (i.e., to forget the images but importantly no instruction is given on the S-R mappings). The experiment is restarted and the participants are again instructed to forget everything they have previously learned. The instruction emphasizes the importance of trying to forget the previously presented objects and only to concentrate on the subsequently to-be-categorized objects. The practice trials are skipped by the experimenter. \n\nRemember-condition. After L1 is learned, a screen is presented providing participants with the same arbitrary experimental overview as in the forget condition. Again, the experimenter has to enter the room to continue the experiment. In contrast to the forget condition, however, this time the participants are simply told that they finished the first part of the learning phase and are going to continue with the second part.\n\nBoth groups then respond to all items in L2 in the four corresponding blocks.\n\nDistractor phase. In a following distractor phase intended to purge short-term memory, participants solve a visual working memory task for three minutes. \nTest phase. In the test phase, participants are then presented with all objects from the learning phase (L1 and L2 regardless for both the remember or forget condition, thus, 64 old objects) and 64 new objects (total of 128 trials).

Pfeuffer", "q3": "Whereas various studies have already demonstrated that humans are able to intentionally forget previously learned information (as often measured using the directed forgetting, short DF, paradigm, for an overview see Past\u00f6tter, Tempel, &amp; B\u00e4uml, 2017), only few studies have analyzed whether DF affects motor representations (Tempel &amp; Frings, 2016) or incidentally learned information (e.g., Hockley, Ahmad, &amp; Nicholson, 2016; Jou, 2010). \n\nHumans are able to intentionally forget previously learned information: In the list-method of DF (for an overview see Past\u00f6tter, Tempel, &amp; B\u00e4uml, 2017), for instance, participants are instructed to sequentially learn two lists of items. After learning the first list (referred to as L1), participants are either instructed to forget or to continue remembering this list before learning list 2 (L2). In a memory test for both lists (regardless of the forget or remember condition), two findings can be observed: Participants in the forget condition recall fewer L1 items (L1 forgetting) and more L2 items (L2 enhancement) as compared to the remember condition.\n\nRecent studies provided first evidence that typical findings on retrieval-induced forgetting and effects of DF on subsequent learning extend to motor memory (in particular, motor sequences, Tempel, Aslan, &amp; Frings, 2016; Tempel &amp; Frings, 2013, 2016) and stimulus-response (S-R) associations (Dreisbach &amp; B\u00e4uml, 2014). The current study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the DF effect on not explicitly instructed and implicitly tested S-R associations. For this, we will investigate whether (not explicitly instructed) learned S-R associations can be intentionally forgotten by employing a DF paradigm that allows the simultaneous measurement of S-R retrieval. \n\n\nOur study will consist of three major phases: A learning phase, a distraction phase, and a test phase. \n\nDuring the learning phase, the participants\u2019 task is to categorize images of objects of two lists (L1 and L2) as containing a mechanism or not and to remember the images. Extending the DF paradigm to S-R mappings using an arbitrary categorization task (drawing on an item-specific priming paradigm; Hsu &amp; Waszak, 2012; Moutsopoulou, Yang, Desantis, &amp; Waszak, 2015; Pfeuffer, Moutsopoulou, Pfister, Waszak, &amp; Kiesel, 2017), this will enable participants to learn S-R associations (stimulus-action, S-A, associations according to the terminology provided by Moutsopoulou et al., 2015). Importantly, whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus differs across the stimuli and is indicated by a task-cue regarding the classification-response mapping prior to the stimulus presentation. For example, the task cue \u201cM + N\u201d indicates that an object image has to be classified as mechanic by pressing a left key and a right key for the classification \u201cnon-mechanic\u201d. Conversely, the task cue \u201cN +M\u201d indicates that a right key press is required for mechanic objects and a left key press for non-mechanic ones.\n\nBetween L1 and L2, half of the participants will be instructed to forget the objects of L1 using a cover-story (forget condition). The other half of the participants will be told to continue remembering the objects and to proceed to the second list (remember condition).\nFollowing a distractor task, participants solve a visual working memory task for three minutes to spurge short-term memory.\n\nIn the test phase, participants are presented with all the object images from the learning phase (L1 and L2 regardless of the remember or forget condition) and new object images. Participants are again instructed to classify objects as containing a mechanism or not. However, for half of the old objects (presented in the learning phase), the S-R associations are the same as they had been in the learning phase (Response repetitions). For the other half of the old objects, the S-R associations are the opposite of what they had been in the learning phase (item-specific response switches). \n\nResponse switches are therefore defined as item-specific switches of the item-specific S-R mappings between the learning (object requires a left key press in the four learning trials of the learning phase ) and the test phase (object requires a right key press in the one test trial of the test phase ). Response repetitions are in turn defined as item-specific repetitions between the learning (object requires a left key press in the four learning trials of the learning phase) and the test phase (object also requires a left key press in the one test trial of the test phase), respectively. \n\nWe then use the difference in response times, RTs, and error rates between trials that require a response switch and response repetition trials as a measure of how DF affects both the formation of novel S-R associations as well as how already formed, competing or not competing, S-R associations may or may not influence the responses given in the test phase.\n\nIn a typical memory test for L1 and L2 in the list-method of DF, two findings can be observed: Participants in the forget condition recall fewer L1 items (L1 forgetting) and more L2 items (L2 enhancement) as compared to the remember condition.\n\nApplying these observations to the context of S-R associations we expect the following observations: If DF influences the persisting activation of the competing S-R associations, the performance difference between response repetition and switch trials should be smaller in the forget as compared with the remember condition for to-be-forgotten L1 items (L1 forgetting). If DF enhances the learning of novel S-R associations, then, the performance difference between response repetition and switch trials should be greater in the forget as compared with the remember condition for L2 items (L2 enhancement).\n", "q4": "Item-specific repetition priming effects describe a typical decrease in RTs and error rates for item-specific response repetitions (see the introduction) between learning phase and test phase trials as compared to response switches. If item-specific S-R associations are formed during the learning phase and are automatically retrieved in the test trial, responses during the test phase should be slower and les accurate for response switches as compared to response repetitions. However, we expect, that in the forget condition, these item-specific repetition priming effects are reduced for items from the to-be-forgotten list 1 (L1) and increased for list 2 (L2):\n\nH1a (L1 forgetting): The item-specific repetition priming effect of RTs (increased RTs for response switches as compared to response repetitions in the test phase) for L1 stimuli is smaller in the forget condition as compared with the remember condition. \n\nH1b (L1 forgetting): The item-specific repetition priming effect of error rates for L1 stimuli (increased error rates for response switches as compared to response repetitions in the test phase) is smaller in the forget condition as compared with the remember condition. \n\nH2a (L2 enhancement): The item-specific repetition priming effect of RTs in the test phase for L2 stimuli is stronger in the forget as compared to the remember condition. \n\nH2b (L2 enhancement): The item-specific repetition priming effect of error rates in the test phase for L2 associations is stronger in the forget as compared to the remember condition.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Images of objects serve as stimuli and denote everyday objects. The participants\u2019 task is to classify the stimuli as containing a mechanism or not (\u201cmechanisch\u201d, Engl. mechanical and \u201cnicht-mechanisch\u201d, Engl. nonmechanical) using a left or right response key. \n\nThe trial structure is as follows: First, a fixation cross is presented (700 ms) including a task-cue that indicates whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus. For example, the task-cue \u201cM + N\u201d indicates that an object image has to be classified as \u201cmechanic\u201d by pressing a left key and a right key for the classification \u201cnon-mechanic\u201d. Conversely, the task cue \u201cN +M\u201d indicates that a right key press is required for mechanic objects and a left key press for non-mechanic ones.\n\nThen, the stimulus (the image of an object) follows. Participants are instructed to classify the object as containing a mechanism or not by pressing the response key (left vs. right) that spatially corresponds to previously presented task-cue mapping. Objects are displayed until a response (classifications via left/right key presses) is given but for a maximum of 2000 ms. Next, a feedback screen is presented informing participants about their response\u00b4s correctness (500 ms; \u201crichtig!\u201d/ Eng: \u201ccorrect!\u201d for correct responses; \u201cFehler!\u201d/ Eng.: \u201cerror!\u201d for incorrect responses). Responses that are outside the response frame are aborted with corresponding feedback (\u201czu langsam!\u201d/ Eng: \u201ctoo slow!\u201d, 500 ms).\n\nImportantly, whether a left or right response is required for the classification of a specific stimulus differs across the stimuli as indicated the task-cue. Thereby, for each specific item participants learn item-specific associations between each stimulus (object image) and the corresponding response (left or right key-press): The participants learns items-specific S-R associations (stimulus-action, S-A, associations according to the terminology provided by Moutsopoulou et al., 2015). \n\nIn order to build stronger S-R associations, each stimulus is presented four times with the same S R mapping in the learning phases.\n\nParticipants are randomly assigned to either the remember condition or the forget condition (38 each). As described, there are three major phases: A learning phase (consisting of L1 and L2 as well as the remember/ forget instruction in-between L1 and L2), a distraction phase, and a test phase.  \n\nInstructions are given on the screen and summarized by an experimenter. After receiving the instructions regarding the classification task (see task description), participants are told to also remember the images of objects they classify. Crucially, participants are not instructed to learn any associations between the images and their responses.\n\nIn a practise block consisting of eight additional object images, participants are familiarized with the task.\n\nLearning phase. The learning phase consists of two lists, list 1 (L1) and list 2 (L2) enabling participants to learn (not explicitly instructed) stimulus-response (S-R) associations. \nIn total, they respond to 32 objects in L1 (presented 4 times, thus, 128 trials), 32 different objects in L2 (presented 4 times, thus, 128 trials). In L1 and L2, each stimulus is paired with the corresponding response four times: L1 and L2 each consist of four blocks and in each block the stimuli of the corresponding list are presented once (and thus four times in total).\n\nFirst, participants respond to all items in L1 in the four corresponding blocks. After and in-between L1 and L2, half of the participants are either instructed to forget or to remember L1. Thus, for participants in the forget condition, L1 consists of to-be-forgotten items (to measure L1 forgetting) and L2 of to-be-remembered items (to measure L2 enhancement). For the remember condition, both L1 and L2 consist of to-be-remembered items. \n\nForget-condition: After L1 is learned, participants in the forget condition are instructed to forget the so-far-presented items. For this, after L1, a computer screen gives an arbitrary overview of the participant\u2019s performance and the current condition group the experiment was in. The participants are asked to go to the experimenter in order to continue the experiment in the next condition group. The experimenter then steps in, reads over the summary and apologizes for having accidentally started the experiment in the incorrect condition group. Thereupon, the experimenter leaves the room pretending to ask the leading researcher what to do next. The experimenter re-enters the room and informs the participants that they could restart the experiment in the correct condition group. The participants are kindly asked to start over again with the correct condition group. The participants are casually told to try to forget what they had just done (i.e., to forget the images but importantly no instruction is given on the S-R mappings). The experiment is restarted and the participants are again instructed to forget everything they have previously learned. The instruction emphasizes the importance of trying to forget the previously presented objects and only to concentrate on the subsequently to-be-categorized objects. The practice trials are skipped by the experimenter. \n\nRemember-condition. After L1 is learned, a screen is presented providing participants with the same arbitrary experimental overview as in the forget condition. Again, the experimenter has to enter the room to continue the experiment. In contrast to the forget condition, however, this time the participants are simply told that they finished the first part of the learning phase and are going to continue with the second part.\n\nBoth groups then respond to all items in L2 in the four corresponding blocks.\n\nDistractor phase. In a following distractor phase intended to purge short-term memory, participants solve a visual working memory task for three minutes. \nTest phase. In the test phase, participants are then presented with all objects from the learning phase (L1 and L2 regardless for both the remember or forget condition, thus, 64 old objects) and 64 new objects (total of 128 trials). Again, participants are instructed to classify the objects as containing a mechanism or not by pressing a left/right key (the same task as in the learning phase). Per list (L1/L2), for half of the stimuli the required response was the same as in the learning phase (response repetition; see introduction), whereas it switches for the other half of the objects (response switches). Items in the test phase are presented once.\n \nUsing post-experimental questions, we will check whether participants had any suspicion about the restart of the experiment. Participants are properly debriefed about the simulated experiment restart and the reason behind this deception. Last, they are asked not to tell friends and colleagues about the simulated experiment restart.\n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e0df63d1a65e9009271e40c", "file_name": "PreReg_DF_SR2_2020.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/7k6tn/files/osfstorage/5e0df63d1a65e9009271e40c", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e0df63d1a65e9009271e40c"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "16e4275d22ad938e5fcedfdc9c62c22458b74c490f0abed3a3e6ea5dbac3b6bb"}}], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited via a local web-based study participation platform where participants can sign up for studies they qualify for on the system.

Volunteers were recruited by posting a link on several online platforms, leading to a website created for this project (www.psychedelicsurvey.com). This website contained information about the study and its purpose, what was expected from the participants and it provided the opportunity to sign up for the study. After reading the study information, individuals who were willing to participate enrolled themselves in the study by declaring informed consent (button click) and entering the expected date of their psychedelic experience.\n\nParticipants were measured on six occasions: 1) One week before the psychedelic session/ceremony/experience was due to take place, or as near to the experience as possible (note, due to travel plans and the potential unavailability of internet, individuals may have needed to complete the baseline measures some time before the experience itself, but crucially, the timing was recorded). At this timepoint, demographic information and baseline trait variables were assessed. 2) Within 0-3 hours of the ceremony/dosing session taking place; state variables concerning set were assessed at this point. 3) Within two days of the session/ceremony/experience took place, to assess the setting of the session/ceremony/experience and the acute psychological effects. 4) Two weeks after the session/ceremony/experience took place, to measure long-term effects. 5) Four weeks after the session/ceremony/experience, the trait variables were assessed again as a follow-up procedure. 6) Approximately 24 months after the session/ceremony/experience, the trait variables were assessed again as a follow-up procedure.\n\nTechnology was designed for participants to receive the right questionnaires on the appropriate moments through email notifications.
