How does the presence or absence of focus particles affect eye movements in reading of focused expressions associated with those particles? \n\nSince the only difference between materials of the first and second experiment is that of the presence of a focus particle, we can directly compare the NF conditions in the first experiment to the ALT conditions in the second experiment. \n\n\n\n\nRooth, M.

In this task, subjects will be exposed to different sized ellipse's, and their task will be to determine whether the ellipse presented to them at each step is \"thinner\" or \"fatter\", compared to a perfect circle. In the ellipse's task, a fixation point will appear first for 500 milliseconds. After that, the ellipse to which the subject will respond will appear. This ellipse will be presented until the response. After responding to the image, a blank screen will appear for 500 milliseconds.\n\nThe second task is the emotional task. In this task, subjects will be exposed to emotional stimuli with established norms (NAPS, Marchewka, urawski, Jednor\u00f3g, &amp;Grabowska, 2014). For every emotional stimulus, the subjects will need to determine whether this emotional picture is making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. Before the presentation of an emotional stimulus, a frame (used as fixation points) whose size is lightly larger than the photo will appear for 500 milliseconds. The emotional picture will then be presented inside the frame until the response. After responding to the image, a blank screen will appear for 500 milliseconds.\n\nThe third task is the gambling task. In this task, subjects will make a choice between 2 keys, and will then win or lose up to three NIS. For every winning or losing amount, the subjects will have to answer one of two questions: (1) whether the gamble outcomes is making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. (2) whether the gamble outcomes are small or big. Each gambling trial will start with a frame painted in green or red that will appear for 500 milliseconds. Each frame will be followed by a number (winning or losing amount) that will appear at the center of the screen. Whether the number is pointing at a win or a loss, will be determined by the color of the frame (green= gain, red= loss). The amount will be presented until response, which will be followed by a blank screen for 500 milliseconds.\n\nExperiment 1 will consist of the ellipse's task only. This experiment is a within subject's design, with two factors: ellipse's height (3 levels), and width (3 levels).\n\nExperiment 2 will consist of the ellipse and the emotional task with trials of the two tasks interleaved. Participants will be told that we are studying the influence of emotion on their circle perception; that we manipulate their emotion using pictures; and that we need to know how they personally feel in response to that picture. This experiment is a within subject's design, with four factors: ellipse's height (3 levels) and width (3 levels), emotion eliciting photos intensity (6 levels), and valence (2 levels). The NAPS pictures were selected according to their valence scores, so that six groups were created. For the first group the valence values will be around the value 2, for the second group the valence values will be around the value 3, and so on. The group of neutral stimuli (valence around 5) will not be used in the present study.\n\nExperiment 3 will consist of all the three tasks: ellipses, emotional, and monetary gain/ loss. This experiment is a between subject's design, with six factors: group (2 levels), the deviation of the stimulus from the standard: ellipse's height (3 levels) and width (3 levels), emotion eliciting photos intensity (6 levels), valence (2 levels) and monetary gains/ losses (6 levels, winning/losing 1,2, or 3 NIS). \nIn Experiment 2 and 3, each emotional trial or monetary gains/ loss trial will be followed by an ellipse trial.\n\nIn Experiment 3, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subjects assigned to the Group 1 will perform two separate sections. In one of those sections, subjects will perform the experiment as described for Experiment 2. In another section, subjects will perform the gambling task (see shortly). In the second group of Experiment 3, subjects will perform the gambling task, with the ellipses task, without the emotional stimuli task. This group will be asked about the size of the gamble outcomes, while Group 1 will be asked about the pleasantness of the gamble outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of having two different groups in Experiment 3 is to show that when subjects are asked to indicate whether a gambling step is pleasant or unpleasant, they do not treat this question in the same manner as they would treat a gain/ loss size question.\n\nTo summarize, in the first experiment subjects will perform only the ellipse task. In the second experiment subjects will perform both the ellipse task and the emotional task, with trials of these two tasks interleaved. In the third experiment, subjects will be divided into two groups: Group 1 will perform the ellipses task, the emotional task, and the gambling task. In the gambling task this group will be asked about the pleasantness of the gamble outcomes. Group 2 will perform the gambling task only, and will be asked about the size of the gambling losing or winning amount. This condition is required in order to provide evidence that pleasantness judgements do not simply reflect expected pleasantness that is based on the size of the monetary win/loss. Evidence for that will be different processing characteristics (As assessed with the LBA parameters) for the 2 tasks (see Givon et al., 2019). \n\nAll key manipulations will be counterbalanced across subjects. All three experiments will begin with detailed instructions. In addition, the experimenter will provide a verbal explanation to ensure that the instructions are clear. \n\nIn every experiment, there will be a practice block. During practice, the experimenter will be present in the room to make sure that the subject got the instructions right. After the practice block another four steps will be completed, and then the experiment will stop, given the subjects another chance to ask for further instructions.\n \nAlso, at the end of every experiment, the experimenter will ask the subject three questions: \n1. Please state in your words: what was your task in the experiment?\n2. What strategy did you use in order to succeed in this task?\n3. In your opinion, what was the goal of this experiment?\n\nIn case that the first experiment will not produce the expected results (the SV parameter from the LBA model will not increase with ellipse height and width), we will try another version of the experiment, this time instead of presenting the ellipse until the response is given, the circle will disappear after 200 milliseconds. The rationale is that responding to a present stimulus might invoke the action system which is known not to behave according to Weber\u2019s Law, whereas responding to a remembered stimulus activates the perception system, which behaves according to Weber\u2019s Law (Ganel et al. 2008). If the new version will not produce the expected results as well, we will have to consider additional alternatives before running the second and third experiment.\n\nIn case that the second experiment will not produce the expected results, then Experiment 3 will not be required anymore. There is also a possibility that because of a time limitation, Experiment 3 will not be implemented.\n\nAfter running the first experiment, there is the possibility that we will change some aspects of the study design of Study 2 and 3. If changes will be needed, we will update those changes in an additional registration.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "The third experiment will consist of two, randomly assigned groups: the first group will complete all three tasks in two blocks: one block with ellipses and the monetary gains/ losses, and one block with ellipses and emotion. \n\nThe second group will complete the ellipses and monetary gains/ losses manipulations only.

The purpose of this pilot is to select total of six ellipses (three wider and three higher ellipses compare to a perfect circle), so that each ellipse will produce similar accuracy rate to the accuracy rate obtained for different valence levels of the emotional stimulus. We will use data that were previously gathered in our lab in order to calculate the accuracy rate for different levels of the emotional stimulus valence. We chose this stimulus selection method since too high or too low accuracy can create model estimation problems that we would like to avoid. Another reason to use this method is that the perceptual stimulus can serve as a closer benchmark to the emotional stimulus.\n\nSecond, we manipulate the emotional intensity of pictures. We will use emotion eliciting photos that have established norms. Each photo had been chosen based on its valence, intensity and category (animals, faces, etc.), So that every category will have a satisfactory representation in the study, that every value of intensity will have a satisfactory representation, and that each valence will have a satisfactory representation as well.\n\nLast, we manipulate monetary gains/ losses, by using gamble trials.

This hierarchical method estimates parameters for each individual separately, but constrain these estimations with the population distribution (see Lin &amp; Strickland, in press, Appendix, for details).\n\nThe evidence-accumulation model that we will use is the liner ballistic accumulation model (LBA). In its more standard applications, this model contains of five parameters: drift rate (v), the drift rate standard deviation (SV), non-decision time, starting point (SP) and response threshold (b) (St0- the range of non-decision time, is usually fixed at zero, since adding it to the model substantially increases fitting time, and since usually there is no substantial question that relates to it).\n\nIn this study we will use a method of model comparison to test some of our hypothesis. The fundamental idea in this method is to fit several different LBA models, and to decide which model fits the data best. To do so, we will create the null model (M1) with all its parameters set to be equal across different levels of the dependent variable in question. Then, we will create five more models (M2-M6), which in every one of those models a different parameter will set as a function of the dependent variable. The null model will serve as a comparison model to the other models. \n\nBecause hierarchical modeling is a time-consuming process, we will use hierarchical modeling only for our main hypotheses. In addition, in order to interpret the data obtained from the hierarchical analysis, the Gelman-Robin index for each individual and for all subjects together must be less than 1.1. If we won't meet this requirement, or if the hypotheses under examination is not a main hypothesis, we will use simpler methods for estimating the model parameters. The simpler method treats the data as if they came from \"one big subject\".  This approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation, and issues BIC values for comparative model fit assessment. This method will conduct using 'rtdis' or 'glba' R packages.  Any model that will have a significant smaller DIC or BIC then M1, will account as a model that fit the data the best. This method will be used by us in the analyses of few of our hypothesis.\n\nTo test our hypothesis that emotional awareness obeys Weber's law, we first need to show that the LBA model is suitable to find evidence to Weber\u2019s law even for physical stimuli. We thus intend to show that the LBA model can detect Weber's law for the perception of ellipses height and width. We term the related hypothesis \u201ctool-validity hypothesis\u201d (TVH) to mark the fact that it is not a core hypothesis. To do so, we will use the model comparison method, and fit several different LBA models to ellipses height and width responses. Model 1 (TVH-M1) is the null model with all its parameters set to be equal across different levels of the ellipses height and width. In Model 2 (TVH-M2), DR is a function of actual height and width. In model 3 (TVH-M3), SV will set as a function of the ellipse's height and width. We expect that in TVH-M7, SV will increase linearly with stimulus intensity, while DR will increase as the ellipse's height and width will move farther away from a perfect circle. If TVH-M7 is shown to be superior over TVH-M2 and TVH-M3, this will support our prediction. In every one of the four remaining models (TVH-M4- TVH-M6), a different parameter (SP, non-decision, b) will set as a function of the different levels of the ellipse's height and width. We will choose the best model to fit the data, based on the DIC or BIC differences between the models (significantly smallest DIC/BIC).  \n\nIn a case that less than 75% of the subjects will fit more to one model compared to the other model (can be deduced by the DIC differences for each subject in both models), we will perform another analysis. For this analysis we will randomly split the data into two separate data sets, so that each subject's trials will be equally distributed between the two sets of data. We than re-run the model with both new data sets, and examined whether the percentage of subjects to fit one model compared to the other model remain almost the same. If the percentage will remain quite like the percentages of the first analysis, we can conclude that the differences between both models are not coincidental. \nIf our hypothesis is not supported by the data, we have two options: First, the LBA model is not suitable to express Weber's law. The second option is that something in the experimental procedure went wrong, then we can fix it and try again. Importantly, until (or whether) the tool-validity hypothesis is supported is a pre-requisite for testing the core hypothesis which is described next. \n\nIn order to test our core hypothesis (that emotional awareness obey Weber's law), we will compare between several alternative models which are strictly analogous to the models we have described above, except for being applied to (un) pleasantness reports. \n\nThe ellipses task is used for two purposes: (1) to create a validated reference-point to the emotional and gamble tasks. (2) To function as a disguise (subjects will be led to believe that we are examining whether emotional stimulation/ gamble outcomes affect perception of circles area). In order to create a validated reference-point, we will use the method of model comparison as described above, and apply it on the difference between tasks (ellipses, emotional, monetary gains/ losses). We expect to find that the model that will show to be superior over the other models, is the model that allows the SP parameter to vary between tasks. This hypothesis is in accordance with previous work conducted in our lab (Givon et al., 2019). \n\nAs mentioned above, Experiment 3 contains of two groups. We will use the method of model comparison and apply it on the difference between these two groups (Both groups differ in the gambling task, so that one group is asked about the pleasantness of the gambling results while the other group is asked about the size of the gambling results). We do not know which model will show to be superior over the other models, but we only need to show any difference between the two tasks. But, because this is an exploratory analysis, we will use a more stringent criterion to that comparison (BF greater than 10 will considered as significant, twice our original criterion (BF greater than 5)).\n\nWe would also like to check for selective influence as means to validate the model and to replicate prior similar validation by Givon et al. (2019). To do so, we will once again use the method of model comparison, and compare between different levels of some of the depended variables (ellipses height and width, intensity, valance, gamble outcomes). We believe that the model that will have the smallest BIC for each of those variables, will be the model that allows the DR and the SV parameters to vary between different levels of the depended variables. If this prediction will be supported, this will serve as evidence for selective influence. As sanity check, we would also aspect to receive higher drift-rate for negative feeling, then for positive felling (as was found in previous work conducted in our lab).\n\nIn the third experiment, we will use gamble trials in order to put the emotional stimuli trials on a ratio scale. This will be done by comparing the DR parameter between gambles and emotional stimuli. For example, let us assume that on average, emotional stimulus whose norm is 6, have DR= 0.6. let's also assume that on average, for a gamble trial in which the participant has won two NIS, its drift rate is also around 0.6. in this case we will say that the pleasantness associated with seeing an emotional stimulus whose norm is 6, is equal to that associated with winning 2 NIS, and since NIS is on a ratio scale, we will be able to anchor DR (and SV) which are also on a ratio scale to another ratio scale. We will repeat the same procedure on all the (grouped by normative rating) emotional stimuli. Note that we are assessing the validity of Weber\u2019s Law on two levels. One level is ordinal: whether SV increases with stimuli intensity. The other level is a ratio-scale level, that requires validation of the ratio-scale properties of DR and its relationship to the NIS scale.\n\nIn addition to examining our central hypothesis, we sought to decide on further debate from within the realm of emotion. There are two approaches for measuring affect rating. The first is the bipolar framework which employs a single bipolar scale ranging from positive to negative, and an additional arousal scale ranging from low to high. The second approach is the bivariate framework which employs that positivity and negativity are two different dimensions, and that arousal is not a dimension (that arousal is dependent on the negative and positive dimensions). \n\nIn order to help decide between these hypotheses, we will use the polarity correspondence principle. This principle argues that when a stimulus and a response alternative correspond, the response selection will be faster than when they do not, and this will be primarily driven by the drift-rate (DR).  Another important term is Markedness. According to the Markedness theory, a term is unmarked when it is the dominant part within a dimension. A marked term is the less dominant part in that dimension. Markedness and polarity together can help decide between the bi-polar and unipolar approaches to valence.  \n\nWe specifically hypothesize (under the unipolar hypothesis) that DR will be higher for both positive and negative (unmarked, under the unipolar approach) when the response is made with the right hand (unmarked) compared to a left-hand response (marked). However, if the bipolar approach is correct, then the expectation is for faster responses when pleasant-unpleasant are mapped to right-left. In order to verify our hypothesis, we will compare RT between two groups of subjects (one group responds \"pleasant\" with their right hand, while the other group responds \"pleasant\" with their left hand). If we will find support for our hypothesis, we will also use the method of model comparison the check our hypothesis at the level of the DR.\n\nWe note that there is also the possibility that the response code from the ellipses\\ gambling task will affect the responses and will thus make it difficult to test our hypothesis in the present design. Another interference can happen due to the classifying of the stimulus as pleasant or unpleasant (that one word is the negation of the other), or because subjects will never classify the stimulus as neutral. In those cases, we will consider conducting another experiment containing the emotional task only, with a different classifying task. \n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "If the estimated parameters will be reasonable (i.e. non-decision time will be greater than 0, and more reasonably greater than .15, and between .5 to 1), no transformation will be needed.

Psychological Research (2019) 83: 132.\n \n", "q8.question": "In this study we will run three experiments, which consist of three different tasks. \n\nThe first task is the ellipse's task. In this task, subjects will be exposed to different sized ellipse's, and their task will be to determine whether the ellipse presented to them at each step is \"thinner\" or \"fatter\", compared to a perfect circle. In the ellipse's task, a fixation point will appear first for 500 milliseconds. After that, the ellipse to which the subject will respond will appear. This ellipse will be presented until the response. After responding to the image, a blank screen will appear for 500 milliseconds.\n\nThe second task is the emotional task. In this task, subjects will be exposed to emotional stimuli with established norms (NAPS, Marchewka, urawski, Jednor\u00f3g, &amp;Grabowska, 2014). For every emotional stimulus, the subjects will need to determine whether this emotional picture is making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. Before the presentation of an emotional stimulus, a frame (used as fixation points) whose size is lightly larger than the photo will appear for 500 milliseconds. The emotional picture will then be presented inside the frame until the response. After responding to the image, a blank screen will appear for 500 milliseconds.\n\nThe third task is the gambling task. In this task, subjects will make a choice between 2 keys, and will then win or lose up to three NIS. For every winning or losing amount, the subjects will have to answer one of two questions: (1) whether the gamble outcomes is making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. (2) whether the gamble outcomes are small or big. Each gambling trial will start with a frame painted in green or red that will appear for 500 milliseconds. Each frame will be followed by a number (winning or losing amount) that will appear at the center of the screen. Whether the number is pointing at a win or a loss, will be determined by the color of the frame (green= gain, red= loss). The amount will be presented until response, which will be followed by a blank screen for 500 milliseconds.\n\nExperiment 1 will consist of the ellipse's task only. This experiment is a within subject's design, with two factors: ellipse's height (3 levels), and width (3 levels).\n\nExperiment 2 will consist of the ellipse and the emotional task with trials of the two tasks interleaved. Participants will be told that we are studying the influence of emotion on their circle perception; that we manipulate their emotion using pictures; and that we need to know how they personally feel in response to that picture. This experiment is a within subject's design, with four factors: ellipse's height (3 levels) and width (3 levels), emotion eliciting photos intensity (6 levels), and valence (2 levels). The NAPS pictures were selected according to their valence scores, so that six groups were created. For the first group the valence values will be around the value 2, for the second group the valence values will be around the value 3, and so on. The group of neutral stimuli (valence around 5) will not be used in the present study.\n\nExperiment 3 will consist of all the three tasks: ellipses, emotional, and monetary gain/ loss. This experiment is a between subject's design, with six factors: group (2 levels), the deviation of the stimulus from the standard: ellipse's height (3 levels) and width (3 levels), emotion eliciting photos intensity (6 levels), valence (2 levels) and monetary gains/ losses (6 levels, winning/losing 1,2, or 3 NIS). \nIn Experiment 2 and 3, each emotional trial or monetary gains/ loss trial will be followed by an ellipse trial.\n\nIn Experiment 3, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subjects assigned to the Group 1 will perform two separate sections. In one of those sections, subjects will perform the experiment as described for Experiment 2. In another section, subjects will perform the gambling task (see shortly). In the second group of Experiment 3, subjects will perform the gambling task, with the ellipses task, without the emotional stimuli task. This group will be asked about the size of the gamble outcomes, while Group 1 will be asked about the pleasantness of the gamble outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of having two different groups in Experiment 3 is to show that when subjects are asked to indicate whether a gambling step is pleasant or unpleasant, they do not treat this question in the same manner as they would treat a gain/ loss size question.\n\nTo summarize, in the first experiment subjects will perform only the ellipse task. In the second experiment subjects will perform both the ellipse task and the emotional task, with trials of these two tasks interleaved. In the third experiment, subjects will be divided into two groups: Group 1 will perform the ellipses task, the emotional task, and the gambling task. In the gambling task this group will be asked about the pleasantness of the gamble outcomes. Group 2 will perform the gambling task only, and will be asked about the size of the gambling losing or winning amount. This condition is required in order to provide evidence that pleasantness judgements do not simply reflect expected pleasantness that is based on the size of the monetary win/loss. Evidence for that will be different processing characteristics (As assessed with the LBA parameters) for the 2 tasks (see Givon et al., 2019). \n\nAll key manipulations will be counterbalanced across subjects. All three experiments will begin with detailed instructions. In addition, the experimenter will provide a verbal explanation to ensure that the instructions are clear. \n\nIn every experiment, there will be a practice block. During practice, the experimenter will be present in the room to make sure that the subject got the instructions right. After the practice block another four steps will be completed, and then the experiment will stop, given the subjects another chance to ask for further instructions.\n \nAlso, at the end of every experiment, the experimenter will ask the subject three questions: \n1. Please state in your words: what was your task in the experiment?\n2. What strategy did you use in order to succeed in this task?\n3. In your opinion, what was the goal of this experiment?\n\nIn case that the first experiment will not produce the expected results (the SV parameter from the LBA model will not increase with ellipse height and width), we will try another version of the experiment, this time instead of presenting the ellipse until the response is given, the circle will disappear after 200 milliseconds. The rationale is that responding to a present stimulus might invoke the action system which is known not to behave according to Weber\u2019s Law, whereas responding to a remembered stimulus activates the perception system, which behaves according to Weber\u2019s Law (Ganel et al. 2008). If the new version will not produce the expected results as well, we will have to consider additional alternatives before running the second and third experiment.\n\nIn case that the second experiment will not produce the expected results, then Experiment 3 will not be required anymore. There is also a possibility that because of a time limitation, Experiment 3 will not be implemented.\n\nAfter running the first experiment, there is the possibility that we will change some aspects of the study design of Study 2 and 3. If changes will be needed, we will update those changes in an additional registration.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will be recruited through online experiment system of Ben- Gurion University. Participant must have intact / corrected vision. In addition, in two of the three experiments, participants will be invited to participate based on their pre-screening depression score that needs to be in the lower two- thirds (given the highly aversive nature of some stimuli, and as justifiably dictated by our Ethics committee). If participants meet this requirement, they will receive an invitation to fill a further depression questionnaire. Only participants who will be within the normal range in the full depression questionnaire outcomes, will receive a link to sign up to the experiment. Subjects whose depression scores are in the clinical range will 1. Be compensated for their participation; 2. will be given an explanation regarding the meaning of this score; and 3.

In addition, in one of the experiments there will be a possibility to win money in a gamble. The subjects will get 20 NIS at the beginning of the experiment. In every trial of this experiment, subjects will be able to win or lose up to 5 NIS. At the end of the experiment, five of the gain trials and five of the loss trials will be selected at random and will be added\\ subtract from their beginning amount (20 NIS). Of course, the subject will never lose more than their beginning amount. In other words, they will earn at least the 35 NIS per hour. \n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "First, we manipulate the width and height of ellipses. The starting point for the manipulation was a perfect circle, with a diameter of 300 pixels. When we manipulate the ellipses height, the width remains constant at 300, and vice versa for width. There are three ellipses that are wider than the perfect circle, and three that are higher than it. \n\nIn order to determine the ellipse height and width, we will conduct a small-scale pilot experiment (N=4) that contains multiple ellipses of varying widths or heights. The purpose of this pilot is to select total of six ellipses (three wider and three higher ellipses compare to a perfect circle), so that each ellipse will produce similar accuracy rate to the accuracy rate obtained for different valence levels of the emotional stimulus. We will use data that were previously gathered in our lab in order to calculate the accuracy rate for different levels of the emotional stimulus valence. We chose this stimulus selection method since too high or too low accuracy can create model estimation problems that we would like to avoid. Another reason to use this method is that the perceptual stimulus can serve as a closer benchmark to the emotional stimulus.\n\nSecond, we manipulate the emotional intensity of pictures. We will use emotion eliciting photos that have established norms. Each photo had been chosen based on its valence, intensity and category (animals, faces, etc.), So that every category will have a satisfactory representation in the study, that every value of intensity will have a satisfactory representation, and that each valence will have a satisfactory representation as well.\n\nLast, we manipulate monetary gains/ losses, by using gamble trials. In every gamble trial the participant can win up to three NIS, or to loss up to three NIS. \n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "In the ellipse's manipulation, participants will indicate (by a key press) if the ellipse they are seeing is \"thinner\" or \"fatter\" (higher or wider, respectively), compared to a perfect circle. \n\nIn the emotional awareness manipulation, we will ask participants if the picture they are seeing is making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. \nIn the gamble task, we will ask participants if the gambles results are making them feel pleasant or unpleasant. Also (in a separate experiment), we will ask participants if the gambles results are small or large. \n\nIn every manipulation we will record RT and response choice for each answer.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "We will use an evidence accumulation model, the liner ballistic accumulation model (LBA) with a focus on DR (drift-rate) and the across-trial SD of drift-rate (SV).", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "In this study we will use the method of fitting a hierarchical Bayesian evidence-accumulation model. This hierarchical method estimates parameters for each individual separately, but constrain these estimations with the population distribution (see Lin &amp; Strickland, in press, Appendix, for details).\n\nThe evidence-accumulation model that we will use is the liner ballistic accumulation model (LBA). In its more standard applications, this model contains of five parameters: drift rate (v), the drift rate standard deviation (SV), non-decision time, starting point (SP) and response threshold (b) (St0- the range of non-decision time, is usually fixed at zero, since adding it to the model substantially increases fitting time, and since usually there is no substantial question that relates to it).\n\nIn this study we will use a method of model comparison to test some of our hypothesis. The fundamental idea in this method is to fit several different LBA models, and to decide which model fits the data best. To do so, we will create the null model (M1) with all its parameters set to be equal across different levels of the dependent variable in question. Then, we will create five more models (M2-M6), which in every one of those models a different parameter will set as a function of the dependent variable. The null model will serve as a comparison model to the other models. \n\nBecause hierarchical modeling is a time-consuming process, we will use hierarchical modeling only for our main hypotheses. In addition, in order to interpret the data obtained from the hierarchical analysis, the Gelman-Robin index for each individual and for all subjects together must be less than 1.1. If we won't meet this requirement, or if the hypotheses under examination is not a main hypothesis, we will use simpler methods for estimating the model parameters. The simpler method treats the data as if they came from \"one big subject\".  This approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation, and issues BIC values for comparative model fit assessment. This method will conduct using 'rtdis' or 'glba' R packages.  Any model that will have a significant smaller DIC or BIC then M1, will account as a model that fit the data the best. This method will be used by us in the analyses of few of our hypothesis.\n\nTo test our hypothesis that emotional awareness obeys Weber's law, we first need to show that the LBA model is suitable to find evidence to Weber\u2019s law even for physical stimuli. We thus intend to show that the LBA model can detect Weber's law for the perception of ellipses height and width. We term the related hypothesis \u201ctool-validity hypothesis\u201d (TVH) to mark the fact that it is not a core hypothesis. To do so, we will use the model comparison method, and fit several different LBA models to ellipses height and width responses. Model 1 (TVH-M1) is the null model with all its parameters set to be equal across different levels of the ellipses height and width. In Model 2 (TVH-M2), DR is a function of actual height and width. In model 3 (TVH-M3), SV will set as a function of the ellipse's height and width. We expect that in TVH-M7, SV will increase linearly with stimulus intensity, while DR will increase as the ellipse's height and width will move farther away from a perfect circle. If TVH-M7 is shown to be superior over TVH-M2 and TVH-M3, this will support our prediction. In every one of the four remaining models (TVH-M4- TVH-M6), a different parameter (SP, non-decision, b) will set as a function of the different levels of the ellipse's height and width. We will choose the best model to fit the data, based on the DIC or BIC differences between the models (significantly smallest DIC/BIC).  \n\nIn a case that less than 75% of the subjects will fit more to one model compared to the other model (can be deduced by the DIC differences for each subject in both models), we will perform another analysis. For this analysis we will randomly split the data into two separate data sets, so that each subject's trials will be equally distributed between the two sets of data. We than re-run the model with both new data sets, and examined whether the percentage of subjects to fit one model compared to the other model remain almost the same. If the percentage will remain quite like the percentages of the first analysis, we can conclude that the differences between both models are not coincidental. \nIf our hypothesis is not supported by the data, we have two options: First, the LBA model is not suitable to express Weber's law. The second option is that something in the experimental procedure went wrong, then we can fix it and try again. Importantly, until (or whether) the tool-validity hypothesis is supported is a pre-requisite for testing the core hypothesis which is described next. \n\nIn order to test our core hypothesis (that emotional awareness obey Weber's law), we will compare between several alternative models which are strictly analogous to the models we have described above, except for being applied to (un) pleasantness reports. \n\nThe ellipses task is used for two purposes: (1) to create a validated reference-point to the emotional and gamble tasks. (2) To function as a disguise (subjects will be led to believe that we are examining whether emotional stimulation/ gamble outcomes affect perception of circles area). In order to create a validated reference-point, we will use the method of model comparison as described above, and apply it on the difference between tasks (ellipses, emotional, monetary gains/ losses). We expect to find that the model that will show to be superior over the other models, is the model that allows the SP parameter to vary between tasks. This hypothesis is in accordance with previous work conducted in our lab (Givon et al., 2019). \n\nAs mentioned above, Experiment 3 contains of two groups. We will use the method of model comparison and apply it on the difference between these two groups (Both groups differ in the gambling task, so that one group is asked about the pleasantness of the gambling results while the other group is asked about the size of the gambling results). We do not know which model will show to be superior over the other models, but we only need to show any difference between the two tasks. But, because this is an exploratory analysis, we will use a more stringent criterion to that comparison (BF greater than 10 will considered as significant, twice our original criterion (BF greater than 5)).\n\nWe would also like to check for selective influence as means to validate the model and to replicate prior similar validation by Givon et al. (2019). To do so, we will once again use the method of model comparison, and compare between different levels of some of the depended variables (ellipses height and width, intensity, valance, gamble outcomes). We believe that the model that will have the smallest BIC for each of those variables, will be the model that allows the DR and the SV parameters to vary between different levels of the depended variables. If this prediction will be supported, this will serve as evidence for selective influence. As sanity check, we would also aspect to receive higher drift-rate for negative feeling, then for positive felling (as was found in previous work conducted in our lab).\n\nIn the third experiment, we will use gamble trials in order to put the emotional stimuli trials on a ratio scale. This will be done by comparing the DR parameter between gambles and emotional stimuli. For example, let us assume that on average, emotional stimulus whose norm is 6, have DR= 0.6. let's also assume that on average, for a gamble trial in which the participant has won two NIS, its drift rate is also around 0.6. in this case we will say that the pleasantness associated with seeing an emotional stimulus whose norm is 6, is equal to that associated with winning 2 NIS, and since NIS is on a ratio scale, we will be able to anchor DR (and SV) which are also on a ratio scale to another ratio scale. We will repeat the same procedure on all the (grouped by normative rating) emotional stimuli. Note that we are assessing the validity of Weber\u2019s Law on two levels. One level is ordinal: whether SV increases with stimuli intensity. The other level is a ratio-scale level, that requires validation of the ratio-scale properties of DR and its relationship to the NIS scale.\n\nIn addition to examining our central hypothesis, we sought to decide on further debate from within the realm of emotion. There are two approaches for measuring affect rating. The first is the bipolar framework which employs a single bipolar scale ranging from positive to negative, and an additional arousal scale ranging from low to high. The second approach is the bivariate framework which employs that positivity and negativity are two different dimensions, and that arousal is not a dimension (that arousal is dependent on the negative and positive dimensions). \n\nIn order to help decide between these hypotheses, we will use the polarity correspondence principle. This principle argues that when a stimulus and a response alternative correspond, the response selection will be faster than when they do not, and this will be primarily driven by the drift-rate (DR).  Another important term is Markedness. According to the Markedness theory, a term is unmarked when it is the dominant part within a dimension. A marked term is the less dominant part in that dimension. Markedness and polarity together can help decide between the bi-polar and unipolar approaches to valence.  \n\nWe specifically hypothesize (under the unipolar hypothesis) that DR will be higher for both positive and negative (unmarked, under the unipolar approach) when the response is made with the right hand (unmarked) compared to a left-hand response (marked). However, if the bipolar approach is correct, then the expectation is for faster responses when pleasant-unpleasant are mapped to right-left. In order to verify our hypothesis, we will compare RT between two groups of subjects (one group responds \"pleasant\" with their right hand, while the other group responds \"pleasant\" with their left hand). If we will find support for our hypothesis, we will also use the method of model comparison the check our hypothesis at the level of the DR.\n\nWe note that there is also the possibility that the response code from the ellipses\\ gambling task will affect the responses and will thus make it difficult to test our hypothesis in the present design. Another interference can happen due to the classifying of the stimulus as pleasant or unpleasant (that one word is the negation of the other), or because subjects will never classify the stimulus as neutral. In those cases, we will consider conducting another experiment containing the emotional task only, with a different classifying task. \n\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships":

The stimuli vary along four binary feature dimensions: type of horns, type of arms, type of marks, and type of eyes. The category structure consists of (a) one diagnostic feature that separates the two categories (the horns); (b) one feature equally distributed across both categories (the eyes); and (c) two features assigned into a pair of correlated features and equally distributed across both categories (the arms and the marks). Correlated feature pairs are feature dimensions that always occur together, regardless of category membership. All possible feature combinations were made, generating a total of 8 unique monsters per category. For the feature inference test, various images (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, tree, etc.) were used to hide the monsters so that only one feature was shown.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nParticipants will be seated with the experimenter while doing the experiment. Instructions will be read out to all participants. \n\nThe trial orders will be randomized for each participant to avoid any order effects. \n\nFor the first task participants will see a monster appear in the middle of the screen and will have to categorize the monster based on if the participant thinks the monster is a \u201cMizulee\u201d or a \u201cNedril\u201d. Participants make responses by pressing either the left or right arrow key corresponding to the monster category. This task will contain 32 trials where after making a response, the participant will be told whether they were correct or incorrect. Each monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and at this time, the participants have to make their response. The monster will remain on the screen for an additional 1 second so that the participants have a chance to look over the features. \n\nThe second task will be feature inference and consist of 14 two alternative forced-choice trials. The monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and will be covered by an object (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, etc.) Only one feature of the monster will be visible to the participant. Two choices of the matching feature will be displayed on the bottom of the screen and participants must choose which feature they think corresponds to the feature seen on the monster. This judgement will be based on what the participant learned about the monster categories in the learning phase. There is a total of 4 correlations trials with correct answers, and 10 control trials with no right or wrong answer. This was done to alleviate any carry-over effects from the previous trial, as well as, allow for more trials in this phase.\n\nThe study will end with a thank you slide, and participants will be given credit for participation."}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "The participants must be between the ages of 4- to 9-years old.

However, this serves as a caveat when category members have common features independent of category membership. These features would be considered irrelevant because they hold no information about what category a member belongs to. There is a debate as to whether or not children are able to selectively attend, and if they are unable, do they pick up on the extraneous features because of their divided attention (Deng &amp; Sloutsky, 2015; Rabi, Miles &amp; Minda, 2015)\n\nDeng and Sloutsky (2015) claimed that children pay attention to extraneous features and learn category rules. In their study, they found that children relied more on probabilistic features regardless of the condition. On the other hand, Rabi and Minda (2014) suggest that children are not holistic learners and can selectively attend. Perhaps, there is too much information to learn with extraneous features that selectively attending is an easier learning strategy. \n\nChildren are presumed to perform better in tasks that involve picking up on correlated features because children struggle to selectively attend. For instance, Kemler (1984) was able to demonstrate how using fictitious categories allowed children to learn family resemblance-structured categories more efficiently than categories that had a single defining feature. The children in the Kemler study were unable to extract information about the single defining feature categories due to their lack of selective attention.

However, this serves as a caveat when category members have common features independent of category membership. These features would be considered irrelevant because they hold no information about what category a member belongs to. There is a debate as to whether or not children are able to selectively attend, and if they are unable, do they pick up on the extraneous features because of their divided attention (Deng &amp; Sloutsky, 2015; Rabi, Miles &amp; Minda, 2015)\n\nDeng and Sloutsky (2015) claimed that children pay attention to extraneous features and learn category rules. In their study, they found that children relied more on probabilistic features regardless of the condition. On the other hand, Rabi and Minda (2014) suggest that children are not holistic learners and can selectively attend. Perhaps, there is too much information to learn with extraneous features that selectively attending is an easier learning strategy. \n\nChildren are presumed to perform better in tasks that involve picking up on correlated features because children struggle to selectively attend. For instance, Kemler (1984) was able to demonstrate how using fictitious categories allowed children to learn family resemblance-structured categories more efficiently than categories that had a single defining feature. The children in the Kemler study were unable to extract information about the single defining feature categories due to their lack of selective attention. However, they were able to learn the family resemblance categories due to their ability to retain information about the non-deterministic features.", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "Since there is a debate in the literature on how children learn categories, there are competing theories that lead to two different outcomes. \n\nIf children are unable to selectively attend but learn the feature correlations, this would support the theory that children are holistic learners.

The stimuli vary along four binary feature dimensions: type of horns, type of arms, type of marks, and type of eyes. The category structure consists of (a) one diagnostic feature that separates the two categories (the horns); (b) one feature equally distributed across both categories (the eyes); and (c) two features assigned into a pair of correlated features and equally distributed across both categories (the arms and the marks). Correlated feature pairs are feature dimensions that always occur together, regardless of category membership. All possible feature combinations were made, generating a total of 8 unique monsters per category. For the feature inference test, various images (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, tree, etc.) were used to hide the monsters so that only one feature was shown.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nParticipants will be seated with the experimenter while doing the experiment. Instructions will be read out to all participants. \n\nThe trial orders will be randomized for each participant to avoid any order effects. \n\nFor the first task participants will see a monster appear in the middle of the screen and will have to categorize the monster based on if the participant thinks the monster is a \u201cMizulee\u201d or a \u201cNedril\u201d. Participants make responses by pressing either the left or right arrow key corresponding to the monster category. This task will contain 32 trials where after making a response, the participant will be told whether they were correct or incorrect. Each monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and at this time, the participants have to make their response. The monster will remain on the screen for an additional 1 second so that the participants have a chance to look over the features. \n\nThe second task will be feature inference and consist of 14 two alternative forced-choice trials. The monster will appear on the screen for 30 seconds and will be covered by an object (i.e. a cloud, brick wall, etc.) Only one feature of the monster will be visible to the participant. Two choices of the matching feature will be displayed on the bottom of the screen and participants must choose which feature they think corresponds to the feature seen on the monster. This judgement will be based on what the participant learned about the monster categories in the learning phase. There is a total of 4 correlations trials with correct answers, and 10 control trials with no right or wrong answer. This was done to alleviate any carry-over effects from the previous trial, as well as, allow for more trials in this phase.\n\nThe study will end with a thank you slide, and participants will be given credit for participation.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "1.
