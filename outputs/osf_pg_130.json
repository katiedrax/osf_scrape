{"data": [{"id": "hd7js", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Choice, Cognition, and Affect during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic", "description": "The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic is an unprecedented event inducing similarly-unprecedented levels of chronic, sustained stress and anxiety on a global scale; thus, the downstream effects of these affective responses on behavior are currently unknown. Previous characterizations of stress and its effects on cognitive performance, using lab inductions of acute stress and measurements of naturally-occurring chronic stress, are arguably of a different magnitude than the intense stress and anxiety induced by the pandemic, due to its life-or-death, quickly changing, pervasive and uncontrollable nature. The current moment is thus a unique opportunity to understand how intense, real-world stress and anxiety influence fundamental cognitive processes, including the ability to flexibly allocate mental resources using cognitive control, and the evaluation of risk and basic construction of value. Understanding how these cognitive abilities and behaviors shift during a pandemic could provide crucial, missing, and foundational information about the human mind and brain under severe stress. Characterizing such effects could prove crucial to the development of strategies, interventions, and policies that address, account for, and mitigate changes in individuals\u2019 choices and cognitive performance in response to intense, real-life, stressors. \n\nTo study this, we are conducting an experiment on Pavlovia, where U.S.-based participants complete both laboratory-quality behavioral tasks and self-report surveys. In particular, participants will complete a risky decision-making task (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2016) dissociating and quantifying risk attitudes, loss aversion, choice consistency, and context effects, and a cognitive control task measuring proactive versus reactive control (an AX-CPT paradigm; adapted from Gonthier et al., 2016). Performance in both of these tasks has been shown to shift in response to affective and stress influences (e.g., risky decision-making: Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; AX-CPT: Chiew &amp; Braver, 2013, 2014; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018), but these effects have typically been characterized in the laboratory using experimentally-induced manipulations of affect and stress. In the present study, we propose to examine shifts in decision-making and controlled performance as a function of pandemic-related stress, which we will characterize using a combination of subjective self-report measures and objective measures indexing pandemic progression using epidemiological data. In addition to behavioral task performance, we will obtain self-reported measures of state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, subjective loneliness, and perceptions of the pandemic and its personal risk. Demographic measures including age, gender identity, socio-economic status, and state and county location will also be measured.\n\nImportantly, we will recruit a sample stratified by state and associated pandemic progression (measured using epidemiological data from state and federal public health agencies) and propose to collect participant data in two phases. In Phase 1, we will collect data every 24 hours over a 20-day period, enabling us to examine whether and how task performance and psychological measures shift across participants as the pandemic progresses over time. Pending funding, Phase 2 will commence immediately after Phase 1 (i.e., 20 days after commencing data collection in Phase 1). Phase 1 participants will be invited to re-enroll in the study and complete task and self-report measures again. Re-enrolled participants will take part in Phase 2 following their participation in Phase 1 as closely as possible (i.e., if a participant was recruited and participated on Day 4 of Phase 1, we will aim to re-enroll them and have them participate on Day 4 of Phase 2).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-27T22:13:40.183480", "date_modified": "2020-03-27T21:57:33.725029", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["affect", "cognitive control", "COVID-19", "risky decision-making", "stress"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "1f468994af1534850e4c9afd0d699ae103a4aa89923c75a5317a48f8118bb4cc0b578627018add0caaf884c97fa0da591be605af4ca49120128c2e31849c18ff1c6542f365882467e03f90bb0495156717a96812b11ae39bd4ee2df557e284b41245e51ec8baf59cd1ec09040d1139c988c74a4f82d2d5e5bcfbf4fda74ae55e5e87d202026fe1839c0f22fb8704724a", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-27T22:13:40.144294", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Kimberly Sarah Chiew"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "We will test how pandemic-related stress, as indexed by self-report measures of anxiety, stress and loneliness, as well as pandemic-related events like changes in the number of confirmed infections or deaths from state and federal databases, are associated with changes in choice and cognitive performance. Specifically, we will test the following predictions. \n\nRisky decision-making: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress will be associated with no net effect on risk attitudes (risk aversion or risk seeking) but decreased loss aversion. We expect no net effect on risk aversion on the basis of mixed prior findings. On the one hand, increased risk aversion was found following the chronic administration of cortisol over 8 days (Kandasamy et al 2014), while another, larger study measuring chronic levels of naturally occurring cortisol on a scale of months found no consistent change (Chumbley et al, 2014). The literature on the effects of acute stress on risk aversion is also mixed, with laboratory studies finding that risk aversion increased (Porcelli &amp; Delgado, 2009), decreased (Pabst et al 2013), and did not change (Sokol-Hessner et al 2016) as a function of acute stress responses. We expect decreased loss aversion on the basis of prior findings indicating that higher chronic levels of cortisol on a scale of months are linked with reduced loss aversion (Chumbley et al, 2014). Our task will additionally enable us to separate any possible effects of chronic, pandemic-related stress on risk attitudes and loss aversion from those on choice consistency. Finally, in our recent research, we have identified strong effects of previous outcomes on subsequent risk-taking that cannot immediately be explained by learning (Brooks &amp; Sokol-Hessner, in revision). Because these findings are so recent, it is not yet known how stress may alter such integrative processes. We will thus explore the effects of stress on temporal context effects in risky monetary decision-making by examining whether the effects of past outcomes on risk taking vary as a function of stress. \n\nAX-CPT performance: We will test the hypothesis that pandemic-related stress, as indexed by both pandemic progression and self-report measures of anxiety, stress, and loneliness, will be associated with a decrease in proactive cognitive control (poorer AY trial performance) in the AX-CPT. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of prior findings of declining context maintenance and proactive control as a function of both anxiety (Fales et al., 2008; Yang, Miskovich, &amp; Larson, 2018) and anticipation of punishment (Braver et al., 2009). Importantly, there are two possible hypotheses we will test regarding reactive control under stress on the basis of prior evidence. While a number of studies (including Braver et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2018) demonstrated an increase in reactive control concurrent with a decrease in proactive control, these modes of control have been argued to operate independently instead of being necessarily inversely correlated (Chiew &amp; Braver, 2017). Given additional observations that cognitive flexibility, which has been argued as analogous to reactive control, decreases under acute, laboratory-induced stress manipulations (Plessow et al., 2011), we will thus also test the hypothesis that reactive control (indexed by BX trial performance) will decline in addition to proactive control. \n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

An inverse efficiency measure combining both accuracy and reaction time (Bruyer &amp; Brysbaert, 2011) will also be calculated for each trial condition and examined using parallel ANOVA analyses. Significant effects will be followed up with pairwise comparisons.  \n\nWe will also compute a proactive index, a composite behavioral variable measuring relative tendency toward proactive control (following Chiew &amp; Braver, 2014), for the same three metrics of behavior: accuracy rates, reaction times, and inverse efficiency measures. The proactive index will be used as an outcome variable in multiple regression analyses with pandemic progression (number of cases and number of deaths), state anxiety, trait anxiety, perceived stress, and loneliness as outcome predictors.\n", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaaaa", "text": "Medicine and Health Sciences"}], [{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48",

Although EMD are one of the most replicated deficits in the psychiatric literature (Franco et al., 2014), the strong heterogeneity of results is still an unexplained issue that could be effectively addressed with a quantitative review of evidence, i.e. a metanalysis. The importance of metanalysis is increasingly stressed in the era of the replication crisis in psychology, as it provides more precise estimates of an original study or claim, and can contribute to theoretical advance by identifying new relations among variables (Cumming, 2014; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016).\nAt present, two metanalyses are available on this topic. A first one (Heinrichs, 2004) provided a single effect size on eye-movement deficits, as part of a much larger meta-analysis on the neurocognitive deficits accompanying schizophrenia, and it included only 14 studies. A second one (O\u2019Driscoll and Callahan, 2008) introduced the importance of considering other features of the patient\u2019s population but only included demographics or major clinical characteristics (like age, duration of illness, and severity of symptoms).

\n\nAuthors: Rea Antoniou, Heather Romero-Kornblum, Winston Chiong\n \nResearch Questions: \n\nAim: To test hypotheses derived from two competing models of the cognitive bases of utilitarian moral judgment. \n\n    In social neuroscience, there has been particular interest in understanding the neural bases of human moral cognition. An organizing focus of this research has been the contrast between utilitarian and non-utilitarian (particularly, deontological) modes of moral reasoning. One influential model of this contrast is the dual process theory advocated by Greene and colleagues (Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2004;  Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002; Paxton, Ungar, &amp; Greene, 2012), informed by broader dual process models of \"intuitive\" fast judgments and \"deliberative\" slow judgments (Gilovich, Griffin &amp; Kahneman, 2002). On this account, characteristically deontological judgments are driven by automatic emotional responses, while characteristically utilitarian judgments are driven by controlled cognitive processes. \n\n    However, an alternative account of utilitarian judgment has been proposed by Kahane and colleagues (Kahane, Everett, Earp, Caviola, Faber, Crockett, &amp;  Savulescu, 2018; Kahane, Everett, Earp, Farias, &amp; Savulescu, 2015). On this two-dimensional model, the two dimensions referenced do not refer (as in Greene's dual process model) to contrasting cognitive processes believed to respectively underlie deontology and utilitarianism, but instead to dissociable components within utilitarian judgment itself. That is, while Greene's dual process theory proposes that utilitarian judgments result from a single, unitary psychological pattern, this model proposes two dimensions: absence of constraints against instrumental harm (the negative dimension) and impartial beneficence (the positive dimension). Kahane and colleagues have presented evidence that these two dimensions of utilitarianism are not associated in the lay population; i.e., willingness to endorse harm in hypothetical moral dilemmas is not indicative of impartial concern for the greater good. \n\n    Kahane and colleagues' primary focus in the positive dimension is on utilitarian requirements for self-sacrifice when the agent's personal interests conflict with the greater good--linked to the philosophical characterization of utilitarianism as demanding. However, commonsense morality (and many varieties of deontology) encompasses both agent-centered permissions, in which one is permitted but not required to favor one's own interests over others, and special obligations, in which one is positively required to favor the interests of relations and those otherwise related to one over strangers (Parfit, 1984; Scheffler, 1994). On a two-dimensional model, utilitarian judgments contrary to agent-centered permissions and special obligations would both reflect a common positive dimension of impartial concern for the greater good that is dissociable from a negative dimension of willingness to instrumentally harm. Meanwhile, on the one-dimensional model of utilitarianism proposed in Greene's dual-process theory, tendencies to utilitarian judgment in all domains of conflict with commonsense morality (those involving personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations) all reflect controlled cognitive processes resulting in deliberate cost-benefit reasoning.\n\n    We propose a study utilizing an existing research platform enrolling healthy older adults to test the predictions of these competing models. Our instrument includes dilemmas involving three domains of conflict between utilitarian judgment and commonsense morality, characterized according to conceptual categories and reviewed for content by two university professors of moral philosophy: agent-centered permissions (AP), special obligations (SO), and personal rights (PR, often referred to in the literature as cases involving \"sacrificial harm\"). This instrument also includes post-decision questions for each dilemma assessing perceived confidence, difficulty and emotion elicitation, as well as a control question to assess participants' understanding of the scenario. \n\nHypotheses tested will be derived from two competing models:\n\nDual process theory (Greene)\n- Hypothesis A1: At the subject level, neuropsychological measures of cognitive control are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis A2: Post-decision self-reports of emotion elicitation are negatively associated with utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis A3: At the subject level, utilitarian judgments across all three categories (personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations) are positively associated.\n\nTwo-dimensional model (Kahane)\n- Hypothesis B1: At the subject level, more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving agent-centered permissions are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving special obligations. \n- Hypothesis B2: At the subject level, there is no positive association between more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving personal rights, and more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving either special obligations or agent-centered permissions (i.e., negative or no association).\n\nExploratory\n- Hypothesis C1: Dorsolateral prefrontal grey matter volumes are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis C2: Ventromedial prefrontal grey matter volumes are negatively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested.\n\nSampling Plan:\n\nExisting data\n    Some task data for this study (127 participants) were collected during an initial piloting phase for our online platform; while descriptive statistical analyses were performed on responses for purposes of platform testing, cognitive/behavioral tests of these preregistered or other hypotheses have not been performed on the data. We will utilize a new opportunity to collect further task data in an expanded cohort of older adults prior to performing the analyses described below. Of note, participants for this study will be recruited from a longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults that includes existing neuroimaging and neuropsychological data, which will be utilized in the analyses described.\n\n    Also of note, in the process of planning for the second wave, a worldwide outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection occurred. This environmental event is likely to introduce heterogeneity between waves, although for many of the hypotheses tested this heterogeneity may or may not influence the magnitude of hypothesized associations between variables. (For instance, in Hypothesis A3, if utilitarian judgments result from a single unitary psychological pattern, then even if there is a main effect of wave on this pattern, the hypothesized associations among judgments in three domains should still hold.) Measures to assess and control for such heterogeneity are described in the analyses and sensitivity analyses described.\n\nData collection procedures\n    Neurologically healthy, community dwelling older adults will be included from a cohort at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center that includes in-person measurements and online web-based behavioral tasks. Participants included in this cohort are assessed as neurologically normal on the basis of informant interview, neurological examination and cognitive testing. Members of this cohort received or will receive an e-mail inviting them to participate in an online instrument that includes the moral reasoning task described below. \n\nSample size \n    In the initial wave of data collection, behavioral data were collected from 127 from our longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults. In the planned second wave of data collection, we aim to collect behavioral data from an additional 150 older adults, for a total sample of 277.  \n  \n    Because our online data collection is not synchronized with in-person standard neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, we will use an algorithm to link participants' task responses to available data from in-person testing. These in-person measures are collected on each participant in the cohort at roughly 2-\u00bd-year intervals. We will limit the linkage of associated neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests to those acquired within 1-\u00bd years of behavioral task performance. This will limit the effective sample size for testing Hypotheses A1, C1 and C2. Based on existing data for wave 1 and data collection patterns for wave 2, we anticipate linked neuropsychological data for hypothesis A1 for 235 participants. We anticipate linked neuroimaging data for hypotheses C1 and C2 for 113 participants. \n\nSample size rationale\n    \nHypothesis A1:\n    Standard power calculations for an expected correlation coefficient of 0.2 at the low end would yield power of 0.87 (n = 235, two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypotheses A2, A3, and B1:\n    Standard power calculations for an expected correlation coefficient of -0.2 (Hypothesis A2) or 0.2 (Hypotheses A3 and B1) at the low end would yield power of 0.92 (n = 277, two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypothesis B2:\n    Based on an assumption of either no effect or a weak effect, standard power calculations assuming power of .8 for a sample of 277 participants correspond to correlation coefficients of 0.17 or -0.17 (two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypotheses C1 and C2:\n    Standard power calculations assuming power of .8 for a sample of 113 participants correspond to a correlation coefficient of 0.26 (two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n\nVariables:\n\nMeasured variables\n\nMoral reasoning task\n    In this task, participants read and answer a set of 24 dilemmatic vignettes, which encompass 3 moral categories. \n1. The Personal Rights (PR) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that would substantially affect the interests of other people, and in which the best overall outcome could only be produced by violating an individual\u2019s personal rights. For instance, whether to push one person into the path of a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five people. Here, the utilitarian choice is to sacrifice the lesser number of people to produce the greatest welfare.\n2. The Agent-centered Permissions (AP) category is composed of 8 items characterized as choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward improving others' welfare at cost to one\u2019s own interests. For example, whether to make a donation or keep the money for one\u2019s own personal use. In this category, the utilitarian choice reflects disregard of self interest for the greater good. \n3. The Special Obligation (SO) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward the favoring of family members, friends, or close others at the cost of the greatest expected welfare. For example, the parental choices that prioritize one's own child's well-being over the well-being of other children. Here, utilitarian judgements reflect disregard of tight social bonds for the greater good.\n\n    To ensure task comprehension, after each dilemma participants are presented a control question asking them to correctly indicate the meaning of the dilemma (binary format yes/no). Participants\u2019 responses will be excluded from the analysis if they choose incorrect responses in 7 or more out of 24 control trials. Within each moral dilemma, three additional questions (ratings) are included: confidence of the decision (\u201cHow confident are you that this was the right choice?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5), difficulty of the decision (\u201cHow difficult did you find this decision?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5) and emotion elicited by the decision (\u201cHow emotional were you when thinking about the situation?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5).\n\n    Each response will be binary coded as either utilitarian (1) or non-utilitarian (-1). Furthermore, there is a difference between a response in which a participant gives a utilitarian response (e.g., killing one to save five) and perceives little difficulty, and a response in which a participant gives a utilitarian response but experiences significant conflict. Intuitively, the first response exhibits a more strongly utilitarian tendency than the latter. For each response, a utilitarian or non-utilitarian (1 or -1) response will be scaled by a factor of (6 - difficulty)/5; thus, a utilitarian response of minimal difficulty will be scored as 1*(6-1)/5 = 1, a utilitarian response of maximal difficulty will be scored as 1*(6-5)/5 = 0.2, a non-utilitarian response of maximal difficulty will be scored as -1*(6-5)/5 = -0.2, and a non-utilitarian response of minimal difficulty will be scored as -1*(6-1)/5 = -1. The score for each category will be the sum of scores of responses to dilemmas of that category. \n\nCognitive control\n    Utilizing standard neuropsychological measures collected as part of participants' involvement in a longitudinal cohort study of aging, we will generate a cognitive control score as the mean of standardized scores for a Stroop interference task, a modified Trails task, and dysexecutive errors.\n\nNeuroimaging data\n    Neuroimaging analyses will utilize FreeSurfer-extracted volumes from T1 structural scans collected as part of this cohort's research involvement at our center. \n\nBehavioral analyses\n    The individual hypotheses tested are non-independent: some are predictions from the dual-process account and others from the two-dimensional model. As our aim is to assess the relative support for either model in our experiment, all hypotheses will first be individually evaluated at a nominal p value of 0.05. \n\n    For hypotheses A3, B1 and B2 we will conduct pairwise correlations among participants' category scores for PR, AP and SO dilemmas. \n\n    For hypothesis A1, we will examine the association of the cognitive control summary score with the total utilitarian judgment score summed across all categories (PR, AP, SO), controlling for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between the cognitive control summary score and wave. Model comparison (via the R anova() function) will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis.\n\n    For hypothesis A2, we will construct a two-level mixed-effects model testing the association of item-level utilitarian judgment scores and emotion elicitation scores across all categories (PR, AP, SO), with items grouped by participant. Items in which participants gave incorrect responses to the control question will be omitted. At the subject level this model will be controlled for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, as for hypothesis A1, a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between emotion elicitation scores and wave. As for hypothesis A1, model comparison will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis.\n\nNeuroimaging analyses\n    For hypotheses C1 and C2, we will examine the association of extracted FreeSurfer grey matter volumes for dlPFC and vmPFC with the total utilitarian judgment score summed across all categories (PR, AP, SO) in general linear models controlling for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, as for hypotheses A1-A2, for each model a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between the utilitarian judgment score and wave. As for hypotheses A1-A2, model comparison will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis. \n\nSensitivity analyses\n    As sensitivity analyses, we will repeat the primary analyses using binary (-1 and 1) utilitarian judgment scores for each dilemma without scaling. We will also repeat the analyses for hypothesis A1, A2, C1 and C2 for each category independently (PR, AP, SO). We will analyze all hypotheses in the two waves separately. We will also repeat the primary analyses with all excluded data re-included. \n\nData Exclusion\n    As above, we will exclude data from participants that incorrectly answered 7 or more control questions, and in item-level analyses (hypothesis A2) we will exclude responses in which participants gave incorrect responses to the subsequent control question. \n\nReferences\n\nGilovich, T., Griffin, D., &amp; Kahneman, D.

An organizing focus of this research has been the contrast between utilitarian and non-utilitarian (particularly, deontological) modes of moral reasoning. One influential model of this contrast is the dual process theory advocated by Greene and colleagues (Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2004;  Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002; Paxton, Ungar, &amp; Greene, 2012), informed by broader dual process models of \"intuitive\" fast judgments and \"deliberative\" slow judgments (Gilovich, Griffin &amp; Kahneman, 2002). On this account, characteristically deontological judgments are driven by automatic emotional responses, while characteristically utilitarian judgments are driven by controlled cognitive processes. \n\n    However, an alternative account of utilitarian judgment has been proposed by Kahane and colleagues (Kahane, Everett, Earp, Caviola, Faber, Crockett, &amp;  Savulescu, 2018; Kahane, Everett, Earp, Farias, &amp; Savulescu, 2015). On this two-dimensional model, the two dimensions referenced do not refer (as in Greene's dual process model) to contrasting cognitive processes believed to respectively underlie deontology and utilitarianism, but instead to dissociable components within utilitarian judgment itself. That is, while Greene's dual process theory proposes that utilitarian judgments result from a single, unitary psychological pattern, this model proposes two dimensions: absence of constraints against instrumental harm (the negative dimension) and impartial beneficence (the positive dimension). Kahane and colleagues have presented evidence that these two dimensions of utilitarianism are not associated in the lay population; i.e., willingness to endorse harm in hypothetical moral dilemmas is not indicative of impartial concern for the greater good. \n\n    Kahane and colleagues' primary focus in the positive dimension is on utilitarian requirements for self-sacrifice when the agent's personal interests conflict with the greater good--linked to the philosophical characterization of utilitarianism as demanding. However, commonsense morality (and many varieties of deontology) encompasses both agent-centered permissions, in which one is permitted but not required to favor one's own interests over others, and special obligations, in which one is positively required to favor the interests of relations and those otherwise related to one over strangers (Parfit, 1984; Scheffler, 1994). On a two-dimensional model, utilitarian judgments contrary to agent-centered permissions and special obligations would both reflect a common positive dimension of impartial concern for the greater good that is dissociable from a negative dimension of willingness to instrumentally harm. Meanwhile, on the one-dimensional model of utilitarianism proposed in Greene's dual-process theory, tendencies to utilitarian judgment in all domains of conflict with commonsense morality (those involving personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations) all reflect controlled cognitive processes resulting in deliberate cost-benefit reasoning.\n\n    We propose a study utilizing an existing research platform enrolling healthy older adults to test the predictions of these competing models. Our instrument includes dilemmas involving three domains of conflict between utilitarian judgment and commonsense morality, characterized according to conceptual categories and reviewed for content by two university professors of moral philosophy: agent-centered permissions (AP), special obligations (SO), and personal rights (PR, often referred to in the literature as cases involving \"sacrificial harm\"). This instrument also includes post-decision questions for each dilemma assessing perceived confidence, difficulty and emotion elicitation, as well as a control question to assess participants' understanding of the scenario. \n\nHypotheses tested will be derived from two competing models:\n\nDual process theory (Greene)\n- Hypothesis A1: At the subject level, neuropsychological measures of cognitive control are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis A2: Post-decision self-reports of emotion elicitation are negatively associated with utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis A3: At the subject level, utilitarian judgments across all three categories (personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations) are positively associated.\n\nTwo-dimensional model (Kahane)\n- Hypothesis B1: At the subject level, more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving agent-centered permissions are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving special obligations. \n- Hypothesis B2: At the subject level, there is no positive association between more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving personal rights, and more utilitarian judgments in dilemmas involving either special obligations or agent-centered permissions (i.e., negative or no association).\n\nExploratory\n- Hypothesis C1: Dorsolateral prefrontal grey matter volumes are positively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested. \n- Hypothesis C2: Ventromedial prefrontal grey matter volumes are negatively associated with more utilitarian judgments across all three moral categories tested.\n\nSampling Plan:\n\nExisting data\n    Some task data for this study (127 participants) were collected during an initial piloting phase for our online platform; while descriptive statistical analyses were performed on responses for purposes of platform testing, cognitive/behavioral tests of these preregistered or other hypotheses have not been performed on the data. We will utilize a new opportunity to collect further task data in an expanded cohort of older adults prior to performing the analyses described below. Of note, participants for this study will be recruited from a longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults that includes existing neuroimaging and neuropsychological data, which will be utilized in the analyses described.\n\n    Also of note, in the process of planning for the second wave, a worldwide outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection occurred. This environmental event is likely to introduce heterogeneity between waves, although for many of the hypotheses tested this heterogeneity may or may not influence the magnitude of hypothesized associations between variables. (For instance, in Hypothesis A3, if utilitarian judgments result from a single unitary psychological pattern, then even if there is a main effect of wave on this pattern, the hypothesized associations among judgments in three domains should still hold.) Measures to assess and control for such heterogeneity are described in the analyses and sensitivity analyses described.\n\nData collection procedures\n    Neurologically healthy, community dwelling older adults will be included from a cohort at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center that includes in-person measurements and online web-based behavioral tasks. Participants included in this cohort are assessed as neurologically normal on the basis of informant interview, neurological examination and cognitive testing. Members of this cohort received or will receive an e-mail inviting them to participate in an online instrument that includes the moral reasoning task described below. \n\nSample size \n    In the initial wave of data collection, behavioral data were collected from 127 from our longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults. In the planned second wave of data collection, we aim to collect behavioral data from an additional 150 older adults, for a total sample of 277.  \n  \n    Because our online data collection is not synchronized with in-person standard neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures, we will use an algorithm to link participants' task responses to available data from in-person testing. These in-person measures are collected on each participant in the cohort at roughly 2-\u00bd-year intervals. We will limit the linkage of associated neuropsychological and neuroimaging tests to those acquired within 1-\u00bd years of behavioral task performance. This will limit the effective sample size for testing Hypotheses A1, C1 and C2. Based on existing data for wave 1 and data collection patterns for wave 2, we anticipate linked neuropsychological data for hypothesis A1 for 235 participants. We anticipate linked neuroimaging data for hypotheses C1 and C2 for 113 participants. \n\nSample size rationale\n    \nHypothesis A1:\n    Standard power calculations for an expected correlation coefficient of 0.2 at the low end would yield power of 0.87 (n = 235, two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypotheses A2, A3, and B1:\n    Standard power calculations for an expected correlation coefficient of -0.2 (Hypothesis A2) or 0.2 (Hypotheses A3 and B1) at the low end would yield power of 0.92 (n = 277, two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypothesis B2:\n    Based on an assumption of either no effect or a weak effect, standard power calculations assuming power of .8 for a sample of 277 participants correspond to correlation coefficients of 0.17 or -0.17 (two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n \nHypotheses C1 and C2:\n    Standard power calculations assuming power of .8 for a sample of 113 participants correspond to a correlation coefficient of 0.26 (two-sided, alpha = 0.05 level).\n\nVariables:\n\nMeasured variables\n\nMoral reasoning task\n    In this task, participants read and answer a set of 24 dilemmatic vignettes, which encompass 3 moral categories. \n1. The Personal Rights (PR) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that would substantially affect the interests of other people, and in which the best overall outcome could only be produced by violating an individual\u2019s personal rights. For instance, whether to push one person into the path of a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five people. Here, the utilitarian choice is to sacrifice the lesser number of people to produce the greatest welfare.\n2. The Agent-centered Permissions (AP) category is composed of 8 items characterized as choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward improving others' welfare at cost to one\u2019s own interests. For example, whether to make a donation or keep the money for one\u2019s own personal use. In this category, the utilitarian choice reflects disregard of self interest for the greater good. \n3. The Special Obligation (SO) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward the favoring of family members, friends, or close others at the cost of the greatest expected welfare. For example, the parental choices that prioritize one's own child's well-being over the well-being of other children. Here, utilitarian judgements reflect disregard of tight social bonds for the greater good.\n\n    To ensure task comprehension, after each dilemma participants are presented a control question asking them to correctly indicate the meaning of the dilemma (binary format yes/no). Participants\u2019 responses will be excluded from the analysis if they choose incorrect responses in 7 or more out of 24 control trials. Within each moral dilemma, three additional questions (ratings) are included: confidence of the decision (\u201cHow confident are you that this was the right choice?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5), difficulty of the decision (\u201cHow difficult did you find this decision?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5) and emotion elicited by the decision (\u201cHow emotional were you when thinking about the situation?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5).\n\n    Each response will be binary coded as either utilitarian (1) or non-utilitarian (-1). Furthermore, there is a difference between a response in which a participant gives a utilitarian response (e.g., killing one to save five) and perceives little difficulty, and a response in which a participant gives a utilitarian response but experiences significant conflict. Intuitively, the first response exhibits a more strongly utilitarian tendency than the latter. For each response, a utilitarian or non-utilitarian (1 or -1) response will be scaled by a factor of (6 - difficulty)/5; thus, a utilitarian response of minimal difficulty will be scored as 1*(6-1)/5 = 1, a utilitarian response of maximal difficulty will be scored as 1*(6-5)/5 = 0.2, a non-utilitarian response of maximal difficulty will be scored as -1*(6-5)/5 = -0.2, and a non-utilitarian response of minimal difficulty will be scored as -1*(6-1)/5 = -1. The score for each category will be the sum of scores of responses to dilemmas of that category. \n\nCognitive control\n    Utilizing standard neuropsychological measures collected as part of participants' involvement in a longitudinal cohort study of aging, we will generate a cognitive control score as the mean of standardized scores for a Stroop interference task, a modified Trails task, and dysexecutive errors.\n\nNeuroimaging data\n    Neuroimaging analyses will utilize FreeSurfer-extracted volumes from T1 structural scans collected as part of this cohort's research involvement at our center. \n\nBehavioral analyses\n    The individual hypotheses tested are non-independent: some are predictions from the dual-process account and others from the two-dimensional model. As our aim is to assess the relative support for either model in our experiment, all hypotheses will first be individually evaluated at a nominal p value of 0.05. \n\n    For hypotheses A3, B1 and B2 we will conduct pairwise correlations among participants' category scores for PR, AP and SO dilemmas. \n\n    For hypothesis A1, we will examine the association of the cognitive control summary score with the total utilitarian judgment score summed across all categories (PR, AP, SO), controlling for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between the cognitive control summary score and wave. Model comparison (via the R anova() function) will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis.\n\n    For hypothesis A2, we will construct a two-level mixed-effects model testing the association of item-level utilitarian judgment scores and emotion elicitation scores across all categories (PR, AP, SO), with items grouped by participant. Items in which participants gave incorrect responses to the control question will be omitted. At the subject level this model will be controlled for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, as for hypothesis A1, a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between emotion elicitation scores and wave. As for hypothesis A1, model comparison will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis.\n\nNeuroimaging analyses\n    For hypotheses C1 and C2, we will examine the association of extracted FreeSurfer grey matter volumes for dlPFC and vmPFC with the total utilitarian judgment score summed across all categories (PR, AP, SO) in general linear models controlling for participant age, gender, educational attainment and wave. In addition, as for hypotheses A1-A2, for each model a second model will be created, adding as another predictor an interaction term between the utilitarian judgment score and wave. As for hypotheses A1-A2, model comparison will be performed to test whether the second model significantly reduces the residual sum of squares; if so, then the second model will be used to test the hypothesis, while if not then the first model will be used to test the hypothesis. \n\nSensitivity analyses\n    As sensitivity analyses, we will repeat the primary analyses using binary (-1 and 1) utilitarian judgment scores for each dilemma without scaling. We will also repeat the analyses for hypothesis A1, A2, C1 and C2 for each category independently (PR, AP, SO). We will analyze all hypotheses in the two waves separately. We will also repeat the primary analyses with all excluded data re-included. \n\nData Exclusion\n    As above, we will exclude data from participants that incorrectly answered 7 or more control questions, and in item-level analyses (hypothesis A2) we will exclude responses in which participants gave incorrect responses to the subsequent control question. \n\nReferences\n\nGilovich, T., Griffin, D., &amp; Kahneman, D.

crisis\n\nAuthors: Rea Antoniou, Heather Romero-Kornblum, Winston Chiong\n\nResearch Questions: The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on utilitarian reasoning\n\nAim: To test hypotheses derived from terror management, socio-emotional selectivity, and dual process theories on utilitarian judgements within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n    Based on the dual process account of moral judgments (Greene, Nystrom, Engell, Darley, &amp; Cohen, 2004; Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002; Paxton, Ungar, &amp; Greene, 2012), contexts that deprive an individual\u2019s deliberative resources may affect inferences, judgments and decisions. \u03a4he specific context of mortality salience (i.e., being reminded of one\u2019s own mortality) may function as one of these contexts and, hence, influence moral judgments. The current threat of the COVID-19 outbreak may provide naturally-induced mortality salience. Accordingly, older people who may be at higher risk for COVID-19 can be especially vulnerable to this effect.\n\n    Terror management theory (TMT) postulates that cognitive defenses are triggered when thinking of one\u2019s eventual death, as an attempt to manage the anxiety that is likely elicited by such a thought (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, &amp; Solomon, 1986). The dual-process model of terror management theory (Hayes, Schimel, Arndt, &amp; Faucher, 2010; Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 1999) proposes that a first attempt to actively suppress conscious thoughts of death depletes cognitive resources. Prior research drawing on TMT and dual theories of moral cognition suggests that individuals who are primed with thoughts of impending death are less likely to give utilitarian responses on conflict problems (Tr\u00e9moli\u00e8re et al., 2012). According to the dual process account of moral cognition, employing cognitive resources in response to moral dilemmas is associated with heightened levels of emotionality (Greene &amp; Haidt, 2002).\n\n    In addition, TMT posits that reminders of one\u2019s mortality drive more meaningful and value-aligned pursuits (Pyszczynski, Greenberg, &amp; Goldenberg, 2003). In the wake of a realization that death can occur at any given time and without control, we seek to affirm the meaning of our existence (Pyszczynski et. al, 2006; Yetzer, Pyszczynski, &amp; Greenberg, 2018). Similarly, according to socio-emotional selectivity theory (SST), priming of the fragility of life and narrowing time horizons shifts goal motivation of adults of all ages from future orientation to that of emotional relevance (Carstensen, 2006; Fung &amp; Carstensen, 2006). While SST is rooted in the realization that one\u2019s time is fleeting, and not specifically of one\u2019s mortality, both TMT and SST describe the regulation of difficult, potentially threatening stimuli. Simply put, when reminded that we are mortal, that life is fleeting and finite, and our time limited, we gravitate towards experiences that can reinforce our values and bring us greater emotional meaning. Accordingly, TMT and SST may be relevant theories in consideration of how individuals approach responding to moral dilemmas, tilting the moral compass towards more value-based reasoning (less utilitarian).\n\n    In light of this, we propose a study comparing responses to hypothetical moral dilemmas during current times of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to responses collected in 2014 to determine the impact of real-time existential threat on utilitarian judgments. We expect that participants who respond to moral dilemmas during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic will respond in a less utilitarian manner, which according to dual process theory and TMT is associated with depletion of cognitive resources stemming from thoughts of one\u2019s eventual death. Additionally, as bunkering down in one\u2019s worldview may provide existential relief and lead to greater confidence in one\u2019s values (Pyszczynski et al., 2006), we predict that current participants will rate their decisions as made with greater confidence. Last, as the current pandemic serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of life and time, as a secondary hypothesis, we predict that ratings of the emotion elicited by the decisions will be higher, overall, among current participants, consistent with SST and dual process theories.\n\nPrimary hypotheses:\n- Hypothesis 1: Participants will give fewer utilitarian responses to moral dilemmas during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic than participants gave prior to this global health crisis.\n- Hypothesis 2: Participants\u2019 ratings of confidence in responding to the moral dilemmas during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic will be higher compared to responses collected prior to this global health crisis.\n\nSecondary hypothesis:\n- Hypothesis 3: Participants\u2019 ratings of emotional elicitation in responding to the moral dilemmas during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic will be higher compared to responses collected in absence of this global health crisis.\n\nSampling Plan:\n\nExisting data\n    The 2014 wave of this study (127 participants) was collected during an initial piloting phase for our online platform; while descriptive statistical analyses were performed on responses for purposes of platform testing, cognitive/behavioral tests of these preregistered or other hypotheses have not been performed on the data. In the context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we propose to collect further data in an expanded cohort of older adults prior to performing the analyses described below. Participants for the 2020 wave will be recruited from the same longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults, with similar recruitment methods, as was used in the 2014 wave, but will be restricted to cohort members that did not participate in the 2014 wave. There will be other differences between the 2014 and 2020 waves, including superficial differences in questionnaire formatting and preliminary instructions. Participants in the 2014 wave received a $20 Amazon gift card for completing the instrument; given lack of current IRB approval for participant payment in the 2020 wave, this will be omitted in the 2020 wave.\n\nData collection procedures\n    Neurologically healthy, community dwelling older adults will be included from a cohort at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center that includes in-person measurements and online web-based behavioral tasks. Participants included in this cohort are assessed as neurologically normal on the basis of informant interview, neurological examination and cognitive testing. Members of this cohort received or will receive an e-mail inviting them to participate in an online instrument that includes the moral reasoning task described below. \n\nSample size \n    In the initial wave of data collection, behavioral data were collected from 127 from our longitudinal cohort of healthy older adults. In the planned second wave of data collection, we aim to collect behavioral data from an additional 150 older adults, for a total sample of 277.    \n\nSample size rationale\n    Standard power calculations for a mean difference of - 0.3 or 0.3 at the low end would yield power of .8 (two-sided, n1 = 127, n2 = 150, alpha = 0.05 level).\n\nVariables:\n\nMeasured variables\n\nMoral reasoning task\n    In this task, participants read and answer a set of 24 dilemmatic vignettes, which encompass 3 moral categories. \n1. The Personal Rights (PR) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that would substantially affect the interests of other people, and in which the best overall outcome could only be produced by violating an individual\u2019s personal rights. For instance, whether to push one person into the path of a runaway trolley that would otherwise kill five people. Here, the utilitarian choice is to sacrifice the lesser number of people to produce the greatest welfare.\n2. The Agent-centered Permissions (AP) category is composed of 8 items characterized as choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward improving others' welfare at cost to one\u2019s own interests. For example, whether to make a donation or keep the money for one\u2019s own personal use. In this category, the utilitarian choice reflects disregard of self interest for the greater good. \n3. The Special Obligation (SO) category is composed of 8 items concerning choices that assess one\u2019s attitude toward the favoring of family members, friends, or close others at the cost of the greatest expected welfare. For example, the parental choices that prioritize one's own child's well-being over the well-being of other children. Here, utilitarian judgements reflect disregard of tight social bonds for the greater good.\n\n    To ensure task comprehension, after each dilemma participants are presented a control question asking them to correctly indicate the meaning of the dilemma (binary format yes/no). Participants\u2019 responses will be excluded from the analysis if they choose incorrect responses in 7 or more out of 24 control trials. Within each moral dilemma, three additional questions (ratings) are included: confidence of the decision (\u201cHow confident are you that this was the right choice?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5), difficulty of the decision (\u201cHow difficult did you find this decision?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5) and emotion elicited by the decision (\u201cHow emotional were you when thinking about the situation?\u201d Likert-scaled 1-5).\n\nTo be collected after participants respond to the moral dilemmas:\nQuestions from Kaiser Family Foundation poll, March 2020. \n\n    In the 2020 wave, we will also collect responses to questions about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The first question is, \"How worried, if at all, are you that you or someone in your family will get sick from the coronavirus?\" The possible answers are: very worried, somewhat worried, not too worried, not at all worried, and don't know. Four questions will query whether the participant has taken any of the following actions in response to the coronavirus outbreak: Decided not to travel or changed travel plans; bought or worn a protective mask; stocked up on items such as food, household supplies, or prescription medications; stayed home instead of going to work, school, or other regular activities; canceled plans to attend large gatherings such as concerts or sporting events. These questions will be used to assess whether our 2020 wave was in fact affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and in sensitivity analyses restricted to participants who describe themselves as affected.\n\nBehavioral analyses\n    The individual hypotheses tested are non-independent: these predictions are all informed by dual process accounts of moral reasoning, TMT, and SST. Thus, all hypotheses will first be individually evaluated at a nominal p value of 0.05, and all three analyses will be reported together.\n    For hypothesis 1, for each participant we will sum their utilitarian responses across the PR, AP and SO categories. The sum of utilitarian responses will be entered as the outcome variable in a linear model with wave, age, gender and educational attainment as predictors. \n    For hypotheses 2 and 3, for each participant we will sum their confidence and emotion elicitation scores across the PR, AP, and SO moral categories. These scores will be entered as outcome variables in linear models with wave, age, gender and educational attainment as predictors.\n\nSensitivity analyses: \n\n    In one sensitivity analysis, we will repeat the primary analyses for hypotheses 1-3, but restricted to responses to PR dilemmas (which have been the main focus of dual process moral theories to date). In another sensitivity analysis, we will limit the wave 2 cohort to participants who either (1) described themselves as either very worried or somewhat worried about the coronavirus outbreak, or (2) have taken at least two of the five described possible responses to the coronavirus outbreak. Finally, we will repeat the primary analyses with all excluded data re-included.\n\nData exclusion:\n\n    As above, we will exclude data from participants that incorrectly answered 7 or more control questions.\n\nReferences\n\nCarstensen, L.
