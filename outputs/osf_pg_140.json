Up to 25 participants will be allowed to participate in each slot, and instructions will be given to the entire group. First, participants will be given verbal instructions. \"Thank you again for helping out with this study. This study explores how social intelligence relates to general intelligence, and how different personal characteristics modify this relationship. First, you will begin by answering several questions about demographic information and attitudes you hold, such as personality questions. Next, you will take a social intelligence test. This test requires you to first guess what emotion people are feeling based off of their facial expression, and then evaluate whether or not five real-life couples will stay together or separate. Next, you will be asked to take a general intelligence test. This test includes a couple of verbal and mathematical tasks requiring multi-tasking. This tests asks you to multi-task to get a better measure of your overall intellectual capacity. These tasks require you to either think about another person or listen to another person, which helps link the general intelligence test to the social intelligence test. After you finish, come to the front desk and I will have a couple of questions to ask you. Before you begin, read and sign your consent form, and then hand it to me. You may then begin the survey: a link is written on the white board.\" Participants will then be asked to hand the experimenter their consent form before beginning the survey. After a quick sound check on each participant's computer, the survey will first ask demographic questions and then all of the other instruments about personal characteristics, such as self-compassion and big 5 personality. Next, they will take the social intelligence test. The first task asks them to identify the emotion from a face. The second task gives them 60 seconds to read a description of a couple and predict whether or not they will stay together.  Then, participants will get feedback. They will be randomly assigned by Qualtrics to one of three conditions: negative feedback (told they are in the 25th-30th percentile), no feedback (they go straight to the intelligence test), or positive feedback (told they are in the 70-75th percentile).  Next, participants will take a supposed general intelligence test. This test purportedly uses multi-tasking to measure overall intellectual capacity. For the first task, participants will listen to a 2-minute excerpt of the book Great Expectations. They will be asked to count how many words begin with \"p\" will simultaneously filling in word fragments. This task serves to bolster the cover story. Then, participants will be asked to perform mathematical operations while simultaneously evaluating a resume.  After completing this task, participants will be probed for suspicion by being asked to answer whether anything seemed unusual, what they guessed the hypothesis was, and when they guessed the hypothesis, if they thought they guessed it. They will also be asked how they felt about their performance on the social intelligence test.  Finally, participants will be asked to report to the experimenter for a debriefing. The experimenter will read the debriefing sheet, which explains the rationale for deception, the study, and assures participants that the feedback they got was fake. Participants will be told that they can remove their data by informing the experimenter at that moment, and that they may use BYU CAPS (Counseling) if they are having trouble with negative emotions or self-perceptions after the study. \n\nSee attached IRB for more detailed explanation"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "IRB_social_intelligence_test.pdf"}, "nodeId": "eru5g", "sha256": "8fb11a08bd381aaefd535d31a11936550115191ae00072a596ec0ad233844377", "viewUrl": "/project/rc7xg/files/osfstorage/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f422/", "selectedFileName": "IRB_social_intelligence_test.pdf"}, {"data": {"name": "irb_sctrait2_surveypdf_3.29.19.pdf"}, "nodeId": "eru5g", "sha256": "0444c1beb2b07819871774cc90fe5f9afa1c2a05ed45eb7a4d5d6e14164bd917", "viewUrl": "/project/rc7xg/files/osfstorage/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f420/", "selectedFileName": "irb_sctrait2_surveypdf_3.29.19.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "We will randomize at the individual level.

Applied to prejudice research, people with self-compassion should feel less of a need to maintain a positive self-image under self-esteem threat and, when threatened, not increase in prejudice towards others.  Previous research we have conducted has shown this effect. However, we seek to replicate this effect with a slightly different operationalization to strengthen the evidence.", "q4": "The main hypothesis is that self-compassion will moderate the effect of a self-esteem threat on prejudice. Specifically, participants higher in self-compassion will shower smaller increases in prejudice when given a self-esteem threat.\n\nWe also predict that self-esteem threat will lead to an increase in prejudice.\n\nFinally, we predict that the effects of the self-esteem threat will be mediated by externalizing, defined as derogating the validity of the test, and not by negative affect", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Up to 25 participants will be allowed to participate in each slot, and instructions will be given to the entire group. First, participants will be given verbal instructions. \"Thank you again for helping out with this study. This study explores how social intelligence relates to general intelligence, and how different personal characteristics modify this relationship. First, you will begin by answering several questions about demographic information and attitudes you hold, such as personality questions. Next, you will take a social intelligence test. This test requires you to first guess what emotion people are feeling based off of their facial expression, and then evaluate whether or not five real-life couples will stay together or separate. Next, you will be asked to take a general intelligence test. This test includes a couple of verbal and mathematical tasks requiring multi-tasking. This tests asks you to multi-task to get a better measure of your overall intellectual capacity. These tasks require you to either think about another person or listen to another person, which helps link the general intelligence test to the social intelligence test. After you finish, come to the front desk and I will have a couple of questions to ask you. Before you begin, read and sign your consent form, and then hand it to me. You may then begin the survey: a link is written on the white board.\" Participants will then be asked to hand the experimenter their consent form before beginning the survey. After a quick sound check on each participant's computer, the survey will first ask demographic questions and then all of the other instruments about personal characteristics, such as self-compassion and big 5 personality. Next, they will take the social intelligence test. The first task asks them to identify the emotion from a face. The second task gives them 60 seconds to read a description of a couple and predict whether or not they will stay together.  Then, participants will get feedback. They will be randomly assigned by Qualtrics to one of three conditions: negative feedback (told they are in the 25th-30th percentile), no feedback (they go straight to the intelligence test), or positive feedback (told they are in the 70-75th percentile).  Next, participants will take a supposed general intelligence test. This test purportedly uses multi-tasking to measure overall intellectual capacity. For the first task, participants will listen to a 2-minute excerpt of the book Great Expectations. They will be asked to count how many words begin with \"p\" will simultaneously filling in word fragments. This task serves to bolster the cover story. Then, participants will be asked to perform mathematical operations while simultaneously evaluating a resume.  After completing this task, participants will be probed for suspicion by being asked to answer whether anything seemed unusual, what they guessed the hypothesis was, and when they guessed the hypothesis, if they thought they guessed it. They will also be asked how they felt about their performance on the social intelligence test.  Finally, participants will be asked to report to the experimenter for a debriefing. The experimenter will read the debriefing sheet, which explains the rationale for deception, the study, and assures participants that the feedback they got was fake. Participants will be told that they can remove their data by informing the experimenter at that moment, and that they may use BYU CAPS (Counseling) if they are having trouble with negative emotions or self-perceptions after the study. \n\nSee attached IRB for more detailed explanation", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f422", "file_name": "IRB_social_intelligence_test.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/rc7xg/files/osfstorage/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f422", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f422"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "8fb11a08bd381aaefd535d31a11936550115191ae00072a596ec0ad233844377"}}, {"file_id": "5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f420", "file_name": "irb_sctrait2_surveypdf_3.29.19.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/rc7xg/files/osfstorage/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f420", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e3c66b3032a4d00fbe6f420"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "0444c1beb2b07819871774cc90fe5f9afa1c2a05ed45eb7a4d5d6e14164bd917"}}], "q12.question": "We will put this study upon on the Brigham Young University (BYU) Psychology Department SONA system, which is open to any BYU student taking those classes.

Disagreements will be resolved by either consensus or consultation with a third review author.\nThe following data will be extracted: first author and year of publications, level of evidence, study design, sample characteristics, type of treatment of control group, number of patients in the experimental and in the control groups, formulation and maximum dose of Botulinum toxin A, location of injection, guidance techniques, number of not-adverse event related interruptions and drop-outs, number of patients with adverse effects in study groups, number of patients with adverse events of intervention and control group; total number, type, seriousness, grading of severity/intensity and time of appearance of the adverse events reported.\n\n\"Risk of bias (quality) assessment\"\nTwo couples of review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in included studies by using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). RoB graph will be created. The McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harms will be utilized to assess for adverse events and complications reporting.\nAny disagreement over the assessment of risk of bias studies will be resolved through discussion between all authors.\n\n\"Strategy for data synthesis\"\nWe will perform qualitative synthesis in order synthetize the results about the most common adverse events reported, their severity and time of appearance, relation or not-relation to botulinum toxin intervention will be evaluated. The results will be discussed according to Internal validity, clinical relevance and applicability of included studies.  We will also report both the total number and type of the adverse events, if they are local or systemic, serious or not,  their severity (mild, moderate or severe grading) and their time of appearance (within or after the first hour), even the number of participants experiencing at least one side effect will be sought (when available). Incidence of adverse events will be calculated by the Experimental Incidence Rate and the Control Incidence Rate (CER), then their ratio, their difference, the Number Need to Harm (NNH) will be reported.\nMeta-analysis of data will be conducted. Statistical heterogeneity of studies will be evaluated using the I\u00b2-test. An I\u00b2 value greater than 60% will be considered as substantial heterogeneity. In such cases random effects model will be used as a conservative approach to account for different sources of variation among studies, with risk ratios (RR) and risk difference (RD) as effect size for the dichotomous outcomes. The significance level will be defined as P&lt;0.05. All the P values will be two-sided, while the weight of studies will be calculated according to the reciprocal of their variance.\nPublication bias will be determine using a funnel plot, RoB graph will be used for visualize the Risk of bias.\nAnalysis will be completed testing the heterogeneity of adverse events' incidence. \nThe meta-regression technique will be used to estimate the impact of age, gender, cause of dystonia or spasticity on adverse events' incidence using the inverse of the variance of the study-level parameter estimate as weight and adjusting for the different follow-up length.\nSensitivity analyses will be carried on conditioning on adverse events\u2019 typology, seriousness, intensity and time of appearance and using a random effect model will be used as a conservative approach.", "q6.uploader": [], "q10.question": "We will search the following electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, British Library, the Cochrane Central, Scopus, PEDRO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov. grey literature (E.g.

To check whether participants actually recalled an experience involving the target emotion, we will examine the effect of emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within subjects\u2019) on the target emotion intensity with three separate ANOVAs and planned comparisons. \n\nExploratory:\nFeeling Moved:\nAlong with pride and gratitude, we selected the positive emotion feeling moved. Feeling moved is high in arousal, thus, it may be valued in independent cultures in terms of arousal (Tsai, 2007). On the other hand, feeling moved is socially engaging, thus, it may be valued in interdependent cultures in terms of its social engagement (Kitayama, Mesquita &amp; Karasawa, 2006). Moreover, initial evidence suggests that people across many cultures find it less appropriate to express feeling moved (Manokara et.al., Manuscript in preparation). Given the culturally contradictory nature of feeling moved and stringent social norms for expressing this emotion, in all cross-cultural analyses, we will examine motives for and propensity to share feeling moved in an exploratory manner.\n\nStudy 1:\nPreferred Sharing Partners. We will explore the most frequent sharing partners for the three positive emotions. To that end, we will describe the frequency of the five different sharing partner categories for each emotion in each culture using boxplots.\n\nStudy 2:\nFrequency of sharing motives. We plan to explore the most frequent motives for sharing the three positive emotions.

Across cultures, we expect people to exhibit greater propensity to share intense compared to less intense positive emotions. We will therefore examine the main effect of the emotional intensity rating of the target emotion on the propensity to share that emotion with three separate linear regressions.\n\nInteraction between positive emotions and culture. To test our prediction that people are more likely to share those positive emotions that align with their cultural values, we will examine the interaction effect of emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within-subjects), and country (India, Netherlands, between subjects), on the dependent variable propensity of sharing emotions with a mixed model ANOVA. We expect Indians to report greater propensity of sharing gratitude than the Dutch, and the Dutch to report greater propensity of sharing pride than Indians. We do not have a-priori predictions for feeling moved, therefore findings for this emotion condition will be exploratory (See Other). \n\nStudy 2:\nGeneral motive behind sharing positive emotions. We predict that across cultures the general motive for sharing positive emotions is to re-experience positive emotions. To that end we will compare scores on the re-experiencing motive against the scores on the other six motives for social sharing with weighted mean comparison (t-test). For this comparison, a 1/6 weighted mean will be calculated for scores on 6 motives and will be compared against the mean on the re-experiencing motive.\n\nInteraction between culture and positive emotions. To test our prediction that people are differentially motivated to re-experience positive emotions by sharing them, we will examine the interaction between emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within subjects\u2019), and country (India, Netherlands, between subjects\u2019), on the aggregate score of the items measuring re-experience motive for sharing positive emotions. Pair-wise comparisons will be used to probe the interaction effect. For gratitude, we expect that Indians will endorse the re-experience motive to a greater extent than the Dutch participants. For pride, we expect that Dutch participants will endorse the re-experience motive to a greater extent than Indians.

As discrete positive emotions are valued differently in different cultures, there is a need to go beyond \u2018happy\u2019 and examine social sharing of discrete positive emotions across different cultures. In the present work we will investigate motives for and propensity to share three positive emotions (pride, gratitude and feeling moved) with participants from the Netherlands and India. ", "other": "Manipulation Check for study 1 &amp; 2:\nAfter  each emotion condition, participants will report the extent to which they felt all three target positive emotions. To check whether participants actually recalled an experience involving the target emotion, we will examine the effect of emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within subjects\u2019) on the target emotion intensity with three separate ANOVAs and planned comparisons. \n\nExploratory:\nFeeling Moved:\nAlong with pride and gratitude, we selected the positive emotion feeling moved. Feeling moved is high in arousal, thus, it may be valued in independent cultures in terms of arousal (Tsai, 2007). On the other hand, feeling moved is socially engaging, thus, it may be valued in interdependent cultures in terms of its social engagement (Kitayama, Mesquita &amp; Karasawa, 2006). Moreover, initial evidence suggests that people across many cultures find it less appropriate to express feeling moved (Manokara et.al., Manuscript in preparation). Given the culturally contradictory nature of feeling moved and stringent social norms for expressing this emotion, in all cross-cultural analyses, we will examine motives for and propensity to share feeling moved in an exploratory manner.\n\nStudy 1:\nPreferred Sharing Partners. We will explore the most frequent sharing partners for the three positive emotions. To that end, we will describe the frequency of the five different sharing partner categories for each emotion in each culture using boxplots.\n\nStudy 2:\nFrequency of sharing motives. We plan to explore the most frequent motives for sharing the three positive emotions. To that end we will describe how distribution of motives differs for each positive emotion using a boxplot and an exploratory factor analysis of the motives for social sharing scale.\n", "sample": "Study 1:\nN = 80, f = 0.15 at 80% power, average effect size based on Choi, Oishi, Shin &amp; Suh, (2019) \n\nStudy 2:\nN = 80, f = 0.15 at 80% power, average effect size based on Choi, Oishi, Shin &amp; Suh, (2019) \n", "analyses": "Study 1:\nMean Propensity to Share. Across cultures we expect that mean propensity to share scores to be higher than the mid-point of the propensity to share measure, therefore greater than 3.5 on the 7-point scale.\n\nMain Effect of Intensity of Emotion. Across cultures, we expect people to exhibit greater propensity to share intense compared to less intense positive emotions. We will therefore examine the main effect of the emotional intensity rating of the target emotion on the propensity to share that emotion with three separate linear regressions.\n\nInteraction between positive emotions and culture. To test our prediction that people are more likely to share those positive emotions that align with their cultural values, we will examine the interaction effect of emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within-subjects), and country (India, Netherlands, between subjects), on the dependent variable propensity of sharing emotions with a mixed model ANOVA. We expect Indians to report greater propensity of sharing gratitude than the Dutch, and the Dutch to report greater propensity of sharing pride than Indians. We do not have a-priori predictions for feeling moved, therefore findings for this emotion condition will be exploratory (See Other). \n\nStudy 2:\nGeneral motive behind sharing positive emotions. We predict that across cultures the general motive for sharing positive emotions is to re-experience positive emotions. To that end we will compare scores on the re-experiencing motive against the scores on the other six motives for social sharing with weighted mean comparison (t-test). For this comparison, a 1/6 weighted mean will be calculated for scores on 6 motives and will be compared against the mean on the re-experiencing motive.\n\nInteraction between culture and positive emotions. To test our prediction that people are differentially motivated to re-experience positive emotions by sharing them, we will examine the interaction between emotion condition (gratitude, pride, feeling moved, within subjects\u2019), and country (India, Netherlands, between subjects\u2019), on the aggregate score of the items measuring re-experience motive for sharing positive emotions. Pair-wise comparisons will be used to probe the interaction effect. For gratitude, we expect that Indians will endorse the re-experience motive to a greater extent than the Dutch participants. For pride, we expect that Dutch participants will endorse the re-experience motive to a greater extent than Indians. We do not have a-priori predictions for feeling moved, therefore findings for this emotion condition will be exploratory(See, Other). \n\n\n", "outliers": "For study 1 &amp; 2:\nParticipants will be asked to report what they ate for dinner last night in the demographics section of the study as an attention check.

The three elements are measured as the situation, thoughts about the situation and feelings are key aspects of social sharing (Rime, 2009). The responses to these three questions will be aggregated to form a measure of propensity of sharing. \n\nStudy 2:\nMotives for Social Sharing: To indicate why participants shared their feelings with others, participants will complete motives for social sharing scale (SSMS-39), which measures seven motives for sharing emotions with others (Duprez, Christophe, Rime, Congrad &amp; Antoine, 2015). In the motives for social sharing scale, participants are asked to indicate their agreement with 39 motive statements for sharing an emotional episode on a 7-point scale (1=not at all, 7= very much).

There are two between-subjects factors. Participants will be randomly assigned to rate either Black or White faces; although they will obviously know which race they are rating, they will not be made explicitly aware that target race varies across participants.

In previous studies, which were within-subjects on all theory-based variables, a sample size of 250 participants has been adequate to detect meaningful effects (see https://osf.io/g8v32/). Given the adjustment in our design, in which target race (black or white) is now a between-subjects factor, we opt to double our sample size (thus maintaining 250 participants per between-subjects condition) and expect that this will be sufficient for detecting effects that are comparable to those that we have found in previous studies.

We will exclude any participants who explicitly respond that they did not take the study seriously or who \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d that they were distracted while completing the survey. Our primary analyses will focus on the data set that remains with these exclusions in place, but we will also conduct the analyses including all respondents who complete the study and report any differences in findings or conclusions that result.\n-\tAlso, we will rely on guidelines for identifying and excluding outliers as suggested by Leys et al., 2019. Thus, we will correct or delete obvious erroneous values, and use the Median Absolute Deviation method to identify univariate outliers. We will exclude any participants who qualify as multivariate outliers according to the Minimum Covariance Determinant method. Subsequently, we will run all analyses both including all data points and with univariate outliers excluded.

In a pilot test of our procedures, we determined that participants took an average of approximately 5 minutes to complete the survey and few needed more than 6 minutes.  As a conservative indicator of excessive off-task activity, we will exclude any participants whose survey completion times exceed 15 minutes (i.e., 3x the average time taken in the pilot test). In addition, as a conservative indicator of excessively fast survey completion times, we will exclude any participants whose survey completion times are less than 1 minute and 40 seconds (100 seconds).

This variable is manipulated between-subjects.\n-\tThe two levels of perceived femininity will be operationalized by norming data associated with each target face in the Chicago Face Database (Ma, Correll, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2015) norming data. High-femininity targets were created using faces that were rated in the highest quartile on perceived femininity for their respective racial group, whereas low-femininity targets were created using faces in the lowest quartile of perceived femininity. To reduce idiosyncratic facial features, we morphed pairs of faces that fell into the same race-by-femininity category to create the stimulus faces. That is, pairs of faces that were identified as high-feminine Black men in the face database were morphed together, as were faces identified as low-feminine Black men, as high-feminine White men, and as low-feminine White men. This procedure was intended to create faces that more prototypically (less idiosyncratically) embody the qualities of race and facial femininity. All morphs were created using the FantaMorph by Abrosoft photo morphing software. \n-\tThe two levels of the skin tone variable will be operationalized by digitally manipulating each of the morphed target images into both a lightened skin tone and a darkened skin tone version using Adobe Photoshop.
