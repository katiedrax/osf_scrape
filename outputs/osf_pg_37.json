"value": "Michelle Momo Wang, Marjorie Rhodes, Amanda Cardarelli"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Previous research has shown that the way science is described to children affects children's interest, persistence, and self-efficacy in science. For example, children who hear more action-based descriptions of science (e.g., \"do science\") from their teachers persist more on science engagement tasks, while children who hear more identity-references to scientists (e.g., \"be scientists\") from their teachers persist less on these tasks. In addition, children who hear more identity-references to scientists from their teachers also indicate less interest in science.\n\nGiven the direct effects of teachers' language on children's science learning, we hope to better understand what affects teachers' language and also how their language might affect children's beliefs about and interest in science across the pre-K school year. \n\nIn this study, we research two imperative questions about teachers' language when describing science: 1) Do teachers' beliefs about science predict the language they use when teaching science (i.e., action-based descriptions of science or identity-references to scientists)? 2 ) Does teachers' language when teaching science affect children's beliefs about and interest in science?\n\nPlease refer to the \"Study design\" and \"Hypotheses\" section for a detailed description of the study procedure and a full list of research questions."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "First, we predict that teachers will believe that being a top scientist requires more innate brilliance than being a typical scientist. Furthermore, we also predict that the more teachers believe that a top scientist requires more innate brilliance than a typical scientist, the more identity-references to scientists and the fewer action-based descriptions of science they will produce.\n\nSecond, we predict that the more teachers essentialize science, the more identity-references to scientists and the fewer action-based descriptions of science they will produce. Furthermore, we also predict that teachers' science essentialism scores will be positively correlated with how much more they believe being a top scientist requires innate brilliance than being a typical scientist.\n\nThird, we predict that teachers' explicit science attitudes (e.g., how much they think boys are more naturally talented in science than girls) will be positively correlated with the number of identity-references to scientists and negatively correlated with the number of action-based descriptions of science they produce. Furthermore, we also predict that their explicit science attitudes will be positively correlated with their science essentialism scores and how much more they believe being a top scientist requires innate brilliance than being a typical scientist.\n\nFourth, we predict that the number of identity-references to scientists teachers produce will be negatively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Furthermore, we also predict that the number of action-based descriptions of science teachers produce will be positively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Also, we predict that teachers' beliefs about science (including their brilliance beliefs about top/typical scientists, their science essentialism scores, and their explicit science attitudes) will be negatively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Given previous work with older children that show how girls are more negatively affected than boys by identity-references to scientists, we also plan to test if the effects of language on children's inclusivity views about science might vary by participant gender (i.e, if girls' inclusivity views about science are both more negatively affected by identity-references to scientists and more positively affected by action-based descriptions of science) and how such interactive effects might develop across time during the Pre-K year.\n\nFifth, we predict that the number of identity-references to scientists teachers produce will be negatively associated with children's gender beliefs about science, including the number of girls they associate with science and the number of boys they associate with art. Furthermore, we also predict that the number of action-based descriptions of science teachers produce will be positively associated with children's gender beliefs about science, including the number of girls they associate with science and the number of boys they associate with art.

Specifically, we will ask them questions about how much innate brilliance a top and typical scientist respectively require (8 items total; 4 items for each type of scientist, order randomized), how much they essentialize science (6 items), and their explicit science attitudes (4 items). At the end of the survey, we will also ask them for their demographic information, including their age, gender, ethnicity, political beliefs, and level of education, and debrief them. Please refer to the \"Teacher Beliefs Email\" document for the email we send them that explains the survey and the \"Teacher Science Beliefs Survey\" for the Qualtrics file of the survey.\n\nThen, we will send teachers a lesson plan about science (please refer to the \"Mystery Capsules Lesson Plan\" document) and a letter accompanying the lesson plan (please refer to the \"Letter to go with lesson plan\" document) sometime later in Spring 2020.

For example, children who hear more action-based descriptions of science (e.g., \"do science\") from their teachers persist more on science engagement tasks, while children who hear more identity-references to scientists (e.g., \"be scientists\") from their teachers persist less on these tasks. In addition, children who hear more identity-references to scientists from their teachers also indicate less interest in science.\n\nGiven the direct effects of teachers' language on children's science learning, we hope to better understand what affects teachers' language and also how their language might affect children's beliefs about and interest in science across the pre-K school year. \n\nIn this study, we research two imperative questions about teachers' language when describing science: 1) Do teachers' beliefs about science predict the language they use when teaching science (i.e., action-based descriptions of science or identity-references to scientists)? 2 ) Does teachers' language when teaching science affect children's beliefs about and interest in science?\n\nPlease refer to the \"Study design\" and \"Hypotheses\" section for a detailed description of the study procedure and a full list of research questions.", "q4": "First, we predict that teachers will believe that being a top scientist requires more innate brilliance than being a typical scientist. Furthermore, we also predict that the more teachers believe that a top scientist requires more innate brilliance than a typical scientist, the more identity-references to scientists and the fewer action-based descriptions of science they will produce.\n\nSecond, we predict that the more teachers essentialize science, the more identity-references to scientists and the fewer action-based descriptions of science they will produce. Furthermore, we also predict that teachers' science essentialism scores will be positively correlated with how much more they believe being a top scientist requires innate brilliance than being a typical scientist.\n\nThird, we predict that teachers' explicit science attitudes (e.g., how much they think boys are more naturally talented in science than girls) will be positively correlated with the number of identity-references to scientists and negatively correlated with the number of action-based descriptions of science they produce. Furthermore, we also predict that their explicit science attitudes will be positively correlated with their science essentialism scores and how much more they believe being a top scientist requires innate brilliance than being a typical scientist.\n\nFourth, we predict that the number of identity-references to scientists teachers produce will be negatively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Furthermore, we also predict that the number of action-based descriptions of science teachers produce will be positively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Also, we predict that teachers' beliefs about science (including their brilliance beliefs about top/typical scientists, their science essentialism scores, and their explicit science attitudes) will be negatively associated with children's inclusivity beliefs about science, including whom they think can do science/be a scientist, whom they think can observe, and whether they associate the big and small groups of people with science. Given previous work with older children that show how girls are more negatively affected than boys by identity-references to scientists, we also plan to test if the effects of language on children's inclusivity views about science might vary by participant gender (i.e, if girls' inclusivity views about science are both more negatively affected by identity-references to scientists and more positively affected by action-based descriptions of science) and how such interactive effects might develop across time during the Pre-K year.\n\nFifth, we predict that the number of identity-references to scientists teachers produce will be negatively associated with children's gender beliefs about science, including the number of girls they associate with science and the number of boys they associate with art. Furthermore, we also predict that the number of action-based descriptions of science teachers produce will be positively associated with children's gender beliefs about science, including the number of girls they associate with science and the number of boys they associate with art. Also, we predict that teachers' beliefs about science (including their brilliance beliefs about top/typical scientists, their science essentialism scores, and their explicit science attitudes) will be negatively associated with children's gender beliefs about science, including the number of girls they associate with science and the number of boys they associate with art.

review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials", "description": "Existing stress-regulation interventions in the sporting field target components of the stress process including: stressors (i.e., a demanding or challenging event that elicits a stress response; see Kerr &amp; Goss, 1996), appraisals (i.e., cognitive evaluation of the potential of the situation to cause harm to functioning; see Larsson, Cook, &amp; Starrin, 1988), affective responses (i.e., the emotional state of an individual following an event; see Wojcikiewicz &amp; Orlick, 1987), and/or coping efforts put in place (i.e., cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage stressors; see Haney, 2004). Cognitive (e.g., thought appraisal, self-talk), multimodal (e.g., cognitive and somatic relaxation training), and alternative (e.g., anger awareness, biofeedback) stress-regulation interventions appear promising for equipping athletes with the knowledge and skills to regulate their stressor experience effectively (Rumbold, Fletcher, &amp; Daniels, 2012). However, our knowledge of the nature of the most effective stress regulation interventions for athletes is limited in several ways. First, an integrative understanding of the effectiveness of stress regulation interventions for athletes is limited to narrative literature reviews (e.g., Rumbold et al., 2012), rather than a statistical synthesis that can provide insight into the magnitude of effect and extent to which the effects generalise across contexts. Doing so requires that we leverage the findings of randomised controlled trials because they provide high-quality evidence regarding cause and effect. Second, the content and structure of effective stress regulation interventions is limited to broad descriptions of the nature of the program (e.g., appraisals, biofeedback). As such, there is a need to interrogate the descriptions of stress regulation interventions in ways that clarify the active ingredients and processes by which these strategies are delivered to athletes to inform guidelines for best practice. Third, the effectiveness of stress regulation interventions is equivocal, so there is a need to explore these differential effects by examining the specific components and outcome measures used in stress regulation experimental designs. We address these gaps in the literature in this systematic review and meta-analysis.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-15T05:40:03.071046", "date_modified": "2020-04-15T05:23:20.026208", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "1f1a7eb59265736d9649f9a0c014f0a5295a50ebef19ce9f450c99140aacf3e1b8c1905e22c04a4c0f6c533ede89c5618a8c9c059d851d2cd97b6fbb34a3d051f13c06ccb82904c2d17fbcd1aed7bb26a60289d895061c29a6acd0d01494870e99150e5fc48c81316c9d96ab7b982b43d58c84e30e8bfa90ff86650b3c89537ed98732a7bad3ebc1ff84785fb3c58e30", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-15T05:40:03.050962", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Daniel Gucciardi"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to:\n1.\tAssess the effectiveness of stress regulation interventions on athletes\u2019 performance and their perceptions of psychological stress. \n2.\tDetermine the conditions under which stress regulation interventions may differentially affect athletes\u2019 performance and their perceptions of psychological stress. \n3.\tAssess the nature of stress regulation interventions (e.g., content, delivery mode) that are found to optimise athletes\u2019 performance and their perceptions of psychological stress."}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": ["No blinding is involved in this study."]}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q6": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Random-effects meta analysis."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "PRISMA-P_stress interventions-FINAL.docx"}, "nodeId": "fbs4k", "sha256": "5bd1e341accc691b848b1439642bd348ea7ce2a06964893d442acf70f8c2a837", "viewUrl": "/project/qjtfv/files/osfstorage/5e969fe64301660460a0917d/", "selectedFileName": "PRISMA-P_stress interventions-FINAL.docx"}], "value": ""}}}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": "Not applicable"}, "q8": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to accessing the data"}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": "Existing data as noted in the response above refers to primary studies that have been collected and will be considered eligible for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis.
