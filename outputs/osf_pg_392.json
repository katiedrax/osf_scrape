To shed light on this question, we conduct what is \u2013 to our knowledge \u2013 the first experimental study of how partisan elites\u2019 preferences over electoral strategies that target a specific group constituency are affected by (1) the social (i.e., racial or class) definition of the target constituency and (2) whether the group\u2019s support for the party is uncertain (i.e., whether they belong to the party\u2019s base or whether they are undecided).

Candidates and campaigns face questions about how to craft strategies to win that involve a combination of mobilizing groups that belong to their base and appealing to groups who are undecided voters.

2018). The rise in overdoses has been driven by the use of opioids: two-thirds of overdoses in 2016 involved an opioid (SAMHSA, 2016). Though opioid use and overdoses are not a new phenomenon, the current crisis has permeated the media with stories of substance use and addiction. What has caused this increased attention by both the media and the public to drug addiction? Popular narratives have focused on how the geography of the current crisis reaches more rural, whiter, conservative, and less wealthy parts of the United States (Jalal et al., 2018; Keyes et al., 2014). In turn, substance users depicted in media stories on the current opioid overdose epidemic have been whiter and from more rural areas than those of the crack scare (Harbin, 2018). This difference in the identities of substance abusers may lead members of the public to support these policies because of their shared group membership. In other words, sharing racial, political, or location-based identities with policy beneficiaries may make people more sympathetic to those beneficiaries. This shared identity with people affected by drug addiction may even cross-pressure partisans who traditionally oppose drug treatment (Meier, 1994) and spending on social policy to instead support these type of policies (e.g., Klar, 2013, 2014; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet, 1944; Mutz, 2002). In this project, we propose to empirically assess these questions using a factorial survey experiment that varies attributes of a news article on a substance user seeking help through treatment. By altering features of the recovering substance user/policy beneficiary, we will assess how both the identity and pathway to addiction of those beneficiaries can affect perceptions of deservingness and, consequently, policy support."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Group Identity H1: We expect that the race, gender, and location in a rural or non-rural location of policy beneficiaries depicted in a media story will affect support for treatment and punitive policies, operationalized as support for increasing funding for opioid treatment policy and punitive policy. Specifically, for the full sample, we expect a decrease in support for funding after reading about a black policy beneficiary compared to a white policy beneficiary. H2: We expect that respondents will be more sympathetic to policy beneficiaries who share identities with the respondent -- e.g., black respondents will be more sympathetic to black policy beneficiaries depicted in the media, while white respondents will be more sympathetic to white policy beneficiaries. Viewing a profile with a shared identity will increase respondent support for funding treatment policy. H3: We expect that any experimental treatment which increases respondent support for funding treatment policy will also decrease respondent support for funding law enforcement to arrest and prosecute drug users. H4: We expect the \u2018blame' outcome variable to negatively correlate with support for funding treatment policy and positively correlate with support for funding punitive policy. Pathway to Addiction H5: We expect that respondents will be more sympathetic to policy beneficiaries who become addicted to opioids via legally obtained prescription drugs linked to a legitimate medical need, e.g. knee surgery. This will make them more supportive of increased funding for treatment. Therefore, as discussed above, respondents will also be less supportive of increased punitive measures and less likely to believe that individuals are to blame for their own addiction. Insurance Coverage H6: We expect that when people receive treatment for addiction from private insurance, respondents will be more supportive of treatment funding than when it is provided by ACA-subsidized insurance or Medicaid. H7: We expect that support for the ACA will be higher when the news article features a recovering addict who is able to obtain treatment via ACA-subsidized insurance. Political Divisions H8: We expect that when a black policy recipient is depicted in the story Republicans will be relatively less supportive of treatment program funding than when a white person is depicted in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). H9: We expect that when a rural policy recipient is depicted in the story Republicans will be relatively more supportive of treatment program funding than when a non-rural person is depicted in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more positive treatment effect among Republicans). H10: We expect that when people began their addiction following surgery and a legal prescription for painkillers, Republicans will be relatively more supportive of treatment program funding than when addiction began with drugs offered at a party in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). This hypothesis stems from the Republican emphasis on personal responsibility when evaluating addiction. H11: We expect that when people began their addiction with heroin, Republicans will be relatively less supportive of treatment program funding than when it began with non-heroin painkillers in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). This hypothesis stems from the historically racialized nature of heroin and other `street drugs'. H12: We expect that when people receive treatment for addiction from private insurance, Republicans (Democrats) will be more (less) supportive of treatment program funding than when it is provided by ACA-subsidized insurance or Medicaid. Personal Exposure H13: We expect that respondents who have personally known someone who has struggled with addiction will express greater support for addiction treatment funding. Outcome Variables 1.

The rise in overdoses has been driven by the use of opioids: two-thirds of overdoses in 2016 involved an opioid (SAMHSA, 2016). Though opioid use and overdoses are not a new phenomenon, the current crisis has permeated the media with stories of substance use and addiction. What has caused this increased attention by both the media and the public to drug addiction? Popular narratives have focused on how the geography of the current crisis reaches more rural, whiter, conservative, and less wealthy parts of the United States (Jalal et al., 2018; Keyes et al., 2014). In turn, substance users depicted in media stories on the current opioid overdose epidemic have been whiter and from more rural areas than those of the crack scare (Harbin, 2018). This difference in the identities of substance abusers may lead members of the public to support these policies because of their shared group membership. In other words, sharing racial, political, or location-based identities with policy beneficiaries may make people more sympathetic to those beneficiaries. This shared identity with people affected by drug addiction may even cross-pressure partisans who traditionally oppose drug treatment (Meier, 1994) and spending on social policy to instead support these type of policies (e.g., Klar, 2013, 2014; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudet, 1944; Mutz, 2002). In this project, we propose to empirically assess these questions using a factorial survey experiment that varies attributes of a news article on a substance user seeking help through treatment. By altering features of the recovering substance user/policy beneficiary, we will assess how both the identity and pathway to addiction of those beneficiaries can affect perceptions of deservingness and, consequently, policy support.", "q16": "Group Identity H1: We expect that the race, gender, and location in a rural or non-rural location of policy beneficiaries depicted in a media story will affect support for treatment and punitive policies, operationalized as support for increasing funding for opioid treatment policy and punitive policy. Specifically, for the full sample, we expect a decrease in support for funding after reading about a black policy beneficiary compared to a white policy beneficiary. H2: We expect that respondents will be more sympathetic to policy beneficiaries who share identities with the respondent -- e.g., black respondents will be more sympathetic to black policy beneficiaries depicted in the media, while white respondents will be more sympathetic to white policy beneficiaries. Viewing a profile with a shared identity will increase respondent support for funding treatment policy. H3: We expect that any experimental treatment which increases respondent support for funding treatment policy will also decrease respondent support for funding law enforcement to arrest and prosecute drug users. H4: We expect the \u2018blame' outcome variable to negatively correlate with support for funding treatment policy and positively correlate with support for funding punitive policy. Pathway to Addiction H5: We expect that respondents will be more sympathetic to policy beneficiaries who become addicted to opioids via legally obtained prescription drugs linked to a legitimate medical need, e.g. knee surgery. This will make them more supportive of increased funding for treatment. Therefore, as discussed above, respondents will also be less supportive of increased punitive measures and less likely to believe that individuals are to blame for their own addiction. Insurance Coverage H6: We expect that when people receive treatment for addiction from private insurance, respondents will be more supportive of treatment funding than when it is provided by ACA-subsidized insurance or Medicaid. H7: We expect that support for the ACA will be higher when the news article features a recovering addict who is able to obtain treatment via ACA-subsidized insurance. Political Divisions H8: We expect that when a black policy recipient is depicted in the story Republicans will be relatively less supportive of treatment program funding than when a white person is depicted in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). H9: We expect that when a rural policy recipient is depicted in the story Republicans will be relatively more supportive of treatment program funding than when a non-rural person is depicted in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more positive treatment effect among Republicans). H10: We expect that when people began their addiction following surgery and a legal prescription for painkillers, Republicans will be relatively more supportive of treatment program funding than when addiction began with drugs offered at a party in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). This hypothesis stems from the Republican emphasis on personal responsibility when evaluating addiction. H11: We expect that when people began their addiction with heroin, Republicans will be relatively less supportive of treatment program funding than when it began with non-heroin painkillers in comparison to Democrats (i.e. a more negative treatment effect among Republicans). This hypothesis stems from the historically racialized nature of heroin and other `street drugs'. H12: We expect that when people receive treatment for addiction from private insurance, Republicans (Democrats) will be more (less) supportive of treatment program funding than when it is provided by ACA-subsidized insurance or Medicaid. Personal Exposure H13: We expect that respondents who have personally known someone who has struggled with addiction will express greater support for addiction treatment funding. Outcome Variables 1.

H2: Two-tailed t-tests of support for treatment funding on each identity treatment within respondent subgroups detailed below. Second, interact identity treatment effect with an indicator for the respondent's identity subgroup.

In this project, we examine misperceptions about presidential power. Citizens and journalists alike often credit or blame the president for many outcomes over which she has little to no control. In particular, presidents\u2019 failure to overcome institutional obstacles such as partisan opposition in Congress is often attributed to their personal characteristics (e.g., the claim that Donald Trump failed to win over Republicans because he is unpersuasive). These misperceptions may be encouraged by media focus on personality narratives, politicians\u2019 incentives to make grandiose promises on the campaign trail, and psychological tendencies to attribute behavior to internal dispositions rather than situational constraints (the \u201cfundamental attribution error\u201d -- see Jones and Nisbett 1971, Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek 1973; but see Malle 2006). As a result, some people may have a stable tendency to attribute vast powers to the president consistent with the cultural mythology of presidential influence (Healy 2008) and to downplay institutional limitations on presidential power or control over events (e.g., Edwards 2003, 2012). However, beliefs about presidential power may interact with partisan motivated reasoning. Partisan supporters are motivated to believe that their candidates are responsible for good events, encouraging attributions of individual control, and not responsible for bad events, encouraging situational (or institutional) attributions of control. Partisan opponents, of course, are motivated to believe the opposite. As a result, beliefs about presidential power may shift in response to changes in the political environment, such as the partisanship of the president. To test these hypotheses, we previously conducted a survey experiment embedded in a panel study (EGAP ID: 20170328AA). The experiment focused on a recent presidential policy failure and randomized whether the failure was attributed to institutional constraints or the president\u2019s personal qualities (or no attribution). This design allowed us to test whether beliefs about presidential power shift in response to policy failures and media frames about the causes of the failure. Additionally, the design allowed us to test whether these effects are moderated by prior beliefs about presidential power and by prior attitudes towards the president (both measured in prior waves). (In previous exploratory research, we contrasted data from a multi-wave panel survey with a survey of scholarly experts recruited from the APSA Presidency & Executive Politics section to measure the prevalence of misperceptions about presidential power and control over political and economic outcomes.) We will conduct a fifth wave of our panel survey in August 2017 following another high-profile failure in the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to reform health care. Respondents will be asked to report their general beliefs about presidential power as well as their specific attributions for Trump\u2019s policy failures on health care. This will allow us to evaluate the stability of general beliefs about presidential power and health care-specific attributions as well as whether and for whom they change. We will specifically examine whether beliefs about presidential power and personal attributions for health care reform\u2019s failure declined more among Trump supporters than among Trump opponents."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We will evaluate the following two hypotheses from the prior preregistration in the new wave of the study: H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power.

(language adapted in this preregistration) We also plan to evaluate the following hypothesis, which is new in this preregistration: H3: Following one or more policy failures, institutional (personal) attributions for policy failure will increase (decrease) more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "[The study protocol is attached.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants will be members of an existing Mechanical Turk panel who are United States residents age 18 or older. We will invite all participants who completed waves 1 and 2 of our panel survey. Prior to beginning the survey, participants will be provided with a description of the study and reminded that participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether they agree to participate in the study. Amazon does not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics and people\u2019s political beliefs and opinions. Randomization approach None. Data collection and blinding All data will be collected online on the Qualtrics survey platform. Primary and secondary outcome measures Before measuring our primary outcome variables (see below), we will re-measure respondents\u2019 beliefs about presidential power and presidential control over various outcomes, which were asked of respondents who participated in two prior survey waves. We ask these questions again here to assess the extent of stability in perceptions about presidential power and control across changes in the political environment. Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control: -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. These scales have been previously tested so we will again take the mean of each after reverse-coding (four-point scale for power, five-point for control). After a distracter task, respondents will answer questions about their attributions for Donald Trump\u2019s failure on health care policy. These questions ask respondents to indicate the perceived accuracy of the following statements on a four-point accuracy scale from very accurate to not at all accurate. The first battery focuses on institutional barriers to Trump\u2019s health care bill while the second focuses on personality or tactical barriers. The order in which respondents answer each battery -- as well as the order of statements within each battery -- will be randomized. Q1. The divisions in Congress would have made it nearly impossible for any president to pass a health care bill. Q2. As president, Trump has relatively little leverage over Congress, making it difficult to pass his health care bill. Q3. Public opinion was a major obstacle to passing the health care bill Trump supported. Q4. Opposition from outside groups helped kill the health care bill Trump supported. Q5. The balance of power in Washington made it extremely difficult for Trump to enact the health care bill. Q6. Trump could have overcome opposition to his health care bill in Congress if he had made a stronger and more persuasive case. Q7. If Trump were a true leader, he would have convinced Congress to support his health care bill. Q8. The public could have been convinced to support the health care bill if Trump had more effectively shaped the debate over the issue. Q9. If Trump tried harder, he would have been be able to pass his health care bill. Q10. Trump\u2019s personality prevented him from leading more effectively in the debate over his health care bill. The four items that make internal attributions will be coded so that 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate, while the external attributions will be coded so that 1=very accurate and 4=not at all accurate. The outcome measures will thus take higher values when respondents make internal attributions and lower values when they make external ones. Following a factor analysis of answers to these questions in wave 4, we will use the following questions to construct two additive scales (including only items with factor loadings greater than .4 that did not crossload in wave 4): Personal: Q6-Q9 Institutional: Q1, Q2, Q5 We will also ask a battery of questions about participants\u2019 perceptions of Trump\u2019s success in various policy areas. (We may use these in exploratory analyses but do not preregister any confirmatory analysis of the results.) Regardless of how you feel about his presidency, how successful do you think Donald Trump has been in achieving his policy goals in the following areas? These will measured on a 4 point scale where 4=extremely successful. Health care Economy Taxes Immigration -Extremely successful -Somewhat successful -Not very successful -Not at all successful Statistical analyses All results will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors (clustered by respondent in diffference-in-difference models) and verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). Finally, we split Trump supporters from opponents using a binary indicator for favorability in wave 1 (the top two categories on a five-point favorability scale; unfavorable is the omitted category). We will estimate models of the following form (using pseudo Stata code): H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. reg Y pres_att female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college, robust where Y = the primary outcome measure(s) of Trump attributions described above for both wave 4 and wave 5 (estimated separately), pres_att = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control in wave 3, and political_knowledge = the number of questions respondents answered correctly on a standard knowledge scale in a prior wave of the panel. Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) H2: Following one or more policy failures, perceptions of presidential power will decline more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. (language adapted in this version of the preregistration) reg Y wave3 wave4 wave5 support wave3Xsupport wave4Xsupport wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college persframe instframe, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control, support = dichotomous indicator for Trump favorability measured at wave 2 (1=somewhat/strongly favorable, 0 otherwise), and wave3, wave4, and wave5 are binary indicators for the observation being measured in those waves (wave 2 is the omitted category). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) This model will only be estimated for respondents who completed all five waves of the study. (If more than 30% of respondents cannot answer a multiple choice question correctly about what happened in Congress on health care before wave 5, we will estimate a model interacting the wave5 term with knowHC_w5, which equals 1 if they know what happened with the health care bill that was voted down in the U.S. Senate on July 28, 2017 and 0 otherwise.) The models for H2 are specified as difference-in-differences models and thus represent a deviation from our prior preregistration, where the models were specified with a prior measure of presidential power as a predictor, a Trump support indicator, and an interaction term. They are also modified to incorporate data from waves 2-4, which were observed at the time of the filing of this preregistration. We will also estimate the following model among all respondents who completed waves 1, 2, and 5: reg Y wave5 support wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college wave3 persframe instframe wave4control, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control and support = dichotomous indicator for Trump favorability measured at wave 2 (1=somewhat/strongly favorable, 0 otherwise). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for whether the respondent took part in wave 3 and for exposure to personal and institutional frame treatments or the control condition in wave 4 (the excluded category is people who did not take part in wave 4). (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) This model will only be estimated for respondents who completed waves 1, 2, and 5 of the study. H3 (new hypothesis in this preregistration): Following one or more policy failures, institutional (personal) attributions for policy failure will increase (decrease) more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. reg Y wave5 support wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college persframe instframe, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scales described above measuring personal and institutional attributions for Trump\u2019s failures on health care reform (estimated separately), support = dichotomous indicator for Trump support measured at wave 3 (1=support, 0 otherwise), and wave5 is a binary indicator for the observation being measured in wave 5 (wave 4 is the omitted category). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. This will be estimated among respondents who completed waves 4 and 5. (If more than 30% of respondents cannot answer a multiple choice question correctly about what happened in Congress on health care before wave 5, we will estimate a model interacting the wave5 term with knowHC_w5, which equals 1 if they know what happened with the health care bill that was voted down in the U.S. Senate on July 28, 2017 and 0 otherwise.) Notes: -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models described below. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace the continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models. In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity.

In this project, we examine misperceptions about presidential power. Citizens and journalists alike often credit or blame the president for many outcomes over which she has little to no control. In particular, presidents\u2019 failure to overcome institutional obstacles such as partisan opposition in Congress is often attributed to their personal characteristics (e.g., the claim that Donald Trump failed to win over Republicans because he is unpersuasive). These misperceptions may be encouraged by media focus on personality narratives, politicians\u2019 incentives to make grandiose promises on the campaign trail, and psychological tendencies to attribute behavior to internal dispositions rather than situational constraints (the \u201cfundamental attribution error\u201d -- see Jones and Nisbett 1971, Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek 1973; but see Malle 2006). As a result, some people may have a stable tendency to attribute vast powers to the president consistent with the cultural mythology of presidential influence (Healy 2008) and to downplay institutional limitations on presidential power or control over events (e.g., Edwards 2003, 2012). However, beliefs about presidential power may interact with partisan motivated reasoning. Partisan supporters are motivated to believe that their candidates are responsible for good events, encouraging attributions of individual control, and not responsible for bad events, encouraging situational (or institutional) attributions of control. Partisan opponents, of course, are motivated to believe the opposite. As a result, beliefs about presidential power may shift in response to changes in the political environment, such as the partisanship of the president. To test these hypotheses, we previously conducted a survey experiment embedded in a panel study (EGAP ID: 20170328AA). The experiment focused on a recent presidential policy failure and randomized whether the failure was attributed to institutional constraints or the president\u2019s personal qualities (or no attribution). This design allowed us to test whether beliefs about presidential power shift in response to policy failures and media frames about the causes of the failure. Additionally, the design allowed us to test whether these effects are moderated by prior beliefs about presidential power and by prior attitudes towards the president (both measured in prior waves). (In previous exploratory research, we contrasted data from a multi-wave panel survey with a survey of scholarly experts recruited from the APSA Presidency & Executive Politics section to measure the prevalence of misperceptions about presidential power and control over political and economic outcomes.) We will conduct a fifth wave of our panel survey in August 2017 following another high-profile failure in the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to reform health care. Respondents will be asked to report their general beliefs about presidential power as well as their specific attributions for Trump\u2019s policy failures on health care. This will allow us to evaluate the stability of general beliefs about presidential power and health care-specific attributions as well as whether and for whom they change. We will specifically examine whether beliefs about presidential power and personal attributions for health care reform\u2019s failure declined more among Trump supporters than among Trump opponents.", "q16": "We will evaluate the following two hypotheses from the prior preregistration in the new wave of the study: H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. H2: Following one or more policy failures, perceptions of presidential power will decline more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. (language adapted in this preregistration) We also plan to evaluate the following hypothesis, which is new in this preregistration: H3: Following one or more policy failures, institutional (personal) attributions for policy failure will increase (decrease) more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump.", "q17": "[The study protocol is attached.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants will be members of an existing Mechanical Turk panel who are United States residents age 18 or older. We will invite all participants who completed waves 1 and 2 of our panel survey. Prior to beginning the survey, participants will be provided with a description of the study and reminded that participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw at any time. Participants will then be asked to indicate whether they agree to participate in the study. Amazon does not provide any identifiable information to the investigators about the study participants, nor will we ask about any identifying information. The nature of data to be obtained: We will collect individual-level survey data, including questions about demographic/political characteristics and people\u2019s political beliefs and opinions. Randomization approach None. Data collection and blinding All data will be collected online on the Qualtrics survey platform. Primary and secondary outcome measures Before measuring our primary outcome variables (see below), we will re-measure respondents\u2019 beliefs about presidential power and presidential control over various outcomes, which were asked of respondents who participated in two prior survey waves. We ask these questions again here to assess the extent of stability in perceptions about presidential power and control across changes in the political environment. Presidential control over outcomes on a five-point scale where 5=total control: -The price of gasoline -The inflation rate -The level of civility in Washington, DC -The amount of gridlock in Congress Statements about presidential power where 4=very accurate for non-starred items and 4=not at all accurate for starred items: -There are no limits to what a president can achieve if he or she uses the powers of his/her office effectively. -Members of Congress can easily resist pressure from the president and vote how they choose.* -Partisanship makes it difficult for any president to achieve consensus on a controversial policy issue.* -Without large partisan majorities in Congress, most presidents will struggle to pass their agenda.* -Gridlock in Congress is typically the result of a failure of presidential leadership. -If a president doesn\u2019t follow through on a campaign promise, it\u2019s probably because they didn\u2019t really want it to happen. These scales have been previously tested so we will again take the mean of each after reverse-coding (four-point scale for power, five-point for control). After a distracter task, respondents will answer questions about their attributions for Donald Trump\u2019s failure on health care policy. These questions ask respondents to indicate the perceived accuracy of the following statements on a four-point accuracy scale from very accurate to not at all accurate. The first battery focuses on institutional barriers to Trump\u2019s health care bill while the second focuses on personality or tactical barriers. The order in which respondents answer each battery -- as well as the order of statements within each battery -- will be randomized. Q1. The divisions in Congress would have made it nearly impossible for any president to pass a health care bill. Q2. As president, Trump has relatively little leverage over Congress, making it difficult to pass his health care bill. Q3. Public opinion was a major obstacle to passing the health care bill Trump supported. Q4. Opposition from outside groups helped kill the health care bill Trump supported. Q5. The balance of power in Washington made it extremely difficult for Trump to enact the health care bill. Q6. Trump could have overcome opposition to his health care bill in Congress if he had made a stronger and more persuasive case. Q7. If Trump were a true leader, he would have convinced Congress to support his health care bill. Q8. The public could have been convinced to support the health care bill if Trump had more effectively shaped the debate over the issue. Q9. If Trump tried harder, he would have been be able to pass his health care bill. Q10. Trump\u2019s personality prevented him from leading more effectively in the debate over his health care bill. The four items that make internal attributions will be coded so that 1=not at all accurate and 4=very accurate, while the external attributions will be coded so that 1=very accurate and 4=not at all accurate. The outcome measures will thus take higher values when respondents make internal attributions and lower values when they make external ones. Following a factor analysis of answers to these questions in wave 4, we will use the following questions to construct two additive scales (including only items with factor loadings greater than .4 that did not crossload in wave 4): Personal: Q6-Q9 Institutional: Q1, Q2, Q5 We will also ask a battery of questions about participants\u2019 perceptions of Trump\u2019s success in various policy areas. (We may use these in exploratory analyses but do not preregister any confirmatory analysis of the results.) Regardless of how you feel about his presidency, how successful do you think Donald Trump has been in achieving his policy goals in the following areas? These will measured on a 4 point scale where 4=extremely successful. Health care Economy Taxes Immigration -Extremely successful -Somewhat successful -Not very successful -Not at all successful Statistical analyses All results will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors (clustered by respondent in diffference-in-difference models) and verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). Finally, we split Trump supporters from opponents using a binary indicator for favorability in wave 1 (the top two categories on a five-point favorability scale; unfavorable is the omitted category). We will estimate models of the following form (using pseudo Stata code): H1: Respondents who perceive high levels of presidential power will rate personal barriers to Donald Trump achieving his goals as greater and institutional barriers as weaker than those who perceive low levels of presidential power. reg Y pres_att female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college, robust where Y = the primary outcome measure(s) of Trump attributions described above for both wave 4 and wave 5 (estimated separately), pres_att = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control in wave 3, and political_knowledge = the number of questions respondents answered correctly on a standard knowledge scale in a prior wave of the panel. Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) H2: Following one or more policy failures, perceptions of presidential power will decline more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. (language adapted in this version of the preregistration) reg Y wave3 wave4 wave5 support wave3Xsupport wave4Xsupport wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college persframe instframe, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control, support = dichotomous indicator for Trump favorability measured at wave 2 (1=somewhat/strongly favorable, 0 otherwise), and wave3, wave4, and wave5 are binary indicators for the observation being measured in those waves (wave 2 is the omitted category). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) This model will only be estimated for respondents who completed all five waves of the study. (If more than 30% of respondents cannot answer a multiple choice question correctly about what happened in Congress on health care before wave 5, we will estimate a model interacting the wave5 term with knowHC_w5, which equals 1 if they know what happened with the health care bill that was voted down in the U.S. Senate on July 28, 2017 and 0 otherwise.) The models for H2 are specified as difference-in-differences models and thus represent a deviation from our prior preregistration, where the models were specified with a prior measure of presidential power as a predictor, a Trump support indicator, and an interaction term. They are also modified to incorporate data from waves 2-4, which were observed at the time of the filing of this preregistration. We will also estimate the following model among all respondents who completed waves 1, 2, and 5: reg Y wave5 support wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college wave3 persframe instframe wave4control, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scale(s) described above measuring perceptions of presidential power/control and support = dichotomous indicator for Trump favorability measured at wave 2 (1=somewhat/strongly favorable, 0 otherwise). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for whether the respondent took part in wave 3 and for exposure to personal and institutional frame treatments or the control condition in wave 4 (the excluded category is people who did not take part in wave 4). (This represents a deviation from our prior preregistration, which said this model would be estimated only within the control condition in wave 4.) This model will only be estimated for respondents who completed waves 1, 2, and 5 of the study. H3 (new hypothesis in this preregistration): Following one or more policy failures, institutional (personal) attributions for policy failure will increase (decrease) more among respondents who support Trump than among respondents who oppose Trump. reg Y wave5 support wave5Xsupport female agegroup2 agegroup3 agegroup4 agegroup5 agegroup6 agegroup7 nonwhite political_knowledge college persframe instframe, robust cluster(respondentid) where Y = the scales described above measuring personal and institutional attributions for Trump\u2019s failures on health care reform (estimated separately), support = dichotomous indicator for Trump support measured at wave 3 (1=support, 0 otherwise), and wave5 is a binary indicator for the observation being measured in wave 5 (wave 4 is the omitted category). Because this is an observational analysis, we include controls for gender, age, race, and education. We will also include controls for the personal and institutional frame treatments in wave 4. This will be estimated among respondents who completed waves 4 and 5. (If more than 30% of respondents cannot answer a multiple choice question correctly about what happened in Congress on health care before wave 5, we will estimate a model interacting the wave5 term with knowHC_w5, which equals 1 if they know what happened with the health care bill that was voted down in the U.S. Senate on July 28, 2017 and 0 otherwise.) Notes: -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models described below. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace the continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models.

area for exploration is the study of leaders and reputations. While traditional theories do not ignore these factors, they have tended to treat them as assumptions, rather than testable hypotheses, in large part due to a lack of data and methods necessary to conduct such tests. The advent of experimental methods, however, provides an opportunity to test reputation and leader characteristics in a controlled setting. In a recent publication, Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth exploit this opportunity to test an original theory about the effects of a reputation for resolve in international disputes. Their study combines and expands the notions of country-specific and leader-specific reputation, developing what they call a theory of \u201cinfluence-specific reputation.\u201d In short, they find evidence that reputations adhere to both countries and specific leaders. Moreover, they find that leader reputations become more important when leaders are perceived to exercise greater or less-restricted control over decisions. This paper seeks to extend the findings of Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth in two ways. Specifically, we will first endeavor to generalize their theory beyond the United States. In order to do so, we will change their second study to a bilateral one, measuring the reputational imputations of citizens of Pakistan and India about each other\u2019s leaders. Secondly, we hope to test the effect of individuals\u2019 prior beliefs on their evaluation of reputations in that same second study. In other words, how much do respondents\u2019 pre-trial assessments of a leader\u2019s resolve change when they are introduced to new information and how does the effect of that new information change based on their prior beliefs? We thusly hope to illustrate that Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth\u2019s findings are valid in a new context, and that prior beliefs affect the way respondents interpret and respond to the information given in their study. Both would be contributions to political scientists\u2019 understanding of the way people perceive reputation."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: HCSR : Even when there is leader turnover, observers will draw reputational inferences across periods.

Hypothesis 3: Leader-specific reputation will be greater for high values of leader influence. Hypothesis 4: A respondent\u2019s pre-scenario appraisal of leader resolve will affect their post-scenario appraisal of leader resolve.

While traditional theories do not ignore these factors, they have tended to treat them as assumptions, rather than testable hypotheses, in large part due to a lack of data and methods necessary to conduct such tests. The advent of experimental methods, however, provides an opportunity to test reputation and leader characteristics in a controlled setting. In a recent publication, Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth exploit this opportunity to test an original theory about the effects of a reputation for resolve in international disputes. Their study combines and expands the notions of country-specific and leader-specific reputation, developing what they call a theory of \u201cinfluence-specific reputation.\u201d In short, they find evidence that reputations adhere to both countries and specific leaders. Moreover, they find that leader reputations become more important when leaders are perceived to exercise greater or less-restricted control over decisions. This paper seeks to extend the findings of Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth in two ways. Specifically, we will first endeavor to generalize their theory beyond the United States. In order to do so, we will change their second study to a bilateral one, measuring the reputational imputations of citizens of Pakistan and India about each other\u2019s leaders. Secondly, we hope to test the effect of individuals\u2019 prior beliefs on their evaluation of reputations in that same second study. In other words, how much do respondents\u2019 pre-trial assessments of a leader\u2019s resolve change when they are introduced to new information and how does the effect of that new information change based on their prior beliefs? We thusly hope to illustrate that Renshon, Dafoe, and Huth\u2019s findings are valid in a new context, and that prior beliefs affect the way respondents interpret and respond to the information given in their study. Both would be contributions to political scientists\u2019 understanding of the way people perceive reputation.", "q16": "Hypothesis 1: HCSR : Even when there is leader turnover, observers will draw reputational inferences across periods. Hypothesis 2: At least when leader influence is high, observers will draw stronger reputational inferences across periods when the leader is the same, compared to when the leader is different. Hypothesis 3: Leader-specific reputation will be greater for high values of leader influence. Hypothesis 4: A respondent\u2019s pre-scenario appraisal of leader resolve will affect their post-scenario appraisal of leader resolve.
