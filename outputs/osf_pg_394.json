"This survey experiment is designed to examine how Americans perceive the cost-effectiveness of live-saving interventions. Existing scholarship on this subject describes a phenomenon called \u201cpsychic numbing,\u201d in which numbers become less impactful as they grow. Thus the impact of saving the first life is greater than the impact of saving the 1,000th life. It might even be the case that voters find it more psychologically meaningful to start a new program that saves 10 lives than to expand an existing program in a way that increases lives saved from 50,000 to 60,000. By a similar logic, voters might find it more psychologically meaningful to completely eliminate a small risk than to make a larger but marginal impact on a bigger risk. Paul Slovic, in particular, has argued that this mechanism helps to explain the so-called \u201cidentifiable victim effect,\u201d as well as Americans\u2019 reluctance to support humanitarian intervention. We might expect that this psychic numbing phenomenon also applies to the way voters make sense of money, in the sense that expenditures should be more psychologically meaningful when compared to smaller baselines. In other words, voters might see it as being more \u201cexpensive\u201d to increase a program from $5 million to $50 million than to increase a program from $500 million to $600 million. The latter seems like a marginal increase while the former is an order-of-magnitude change. If these mechanisms exist, then they would have important implications for shaping the way that the U.S. public evaluates risk management expenditures. In particular, these dynamics suggest that the public will be most willing to support spending funds to expand programs that are already well-funded, in order to reduce risks that are already quite small. In these cases, the psychic cost of the additional funding is low, and the psychic benefit of the risk reduction is high. By contrast, voters would be least willing to devote resources to programs that are currently poorly-funded, to reduce risks that are quite large. In these cases, the psychic cost of the additional funding is great, and the psychic benefit of the risk reduction is small.

I disaggregate and measure political participation in general and context specific ways. I exploit the natural experiment of random quota assignment in Delhi municipal elections, where 50% wards were randomly reserved for women in 2012 and 2017. I embed a two wave panel survey of 1600+ HHs across 17 wards in Delhi within this natural experiment to examine the difference in levels of participation and gender gap between reserved and non-reserved wards. Apart from women's participation and gender gap outcomes, I examine whether quotas were able to mobilise both men and women in the context of anti-corruption protests, anti-rape/ sexual violence and environmental protests that have gripped Delhi since 2012 till date. Lastly, I embed a survey experiment to examine whether being informed about the quota policy has any effect on perceptions of inclusion and democratic accountability in the political system."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "I firstly exploit the natural experiment where 50% wards were reserved for women in 2017. I consider a ward treated if it was reserved for women in 2017. I use a two wave panel survey with an in-person baseline and end-line interview. The end-line is attempted after a washout period of 3 weeks. In the baseline I ask a series of questions on political participation, awareness, interest, agency, political engagement and partisanship in all wards. The outcome questions have been indicated in the excel sheet for both baseline and end-line survey. I expect the treated wards to have improved levels of political participation, awareness and engagement. I also expect that wards that are treated will record more political participation for causes related to women and environment for both men and women, relative to non-treated wards. In the end-line, I ask another series of questions on how people receive the information to participate, responses related to time, agency and resources to examine some of the causal mechanisms of why I expect treatment to improve political participation. Moreover, based on qualitative interviews with political party workers, I hypothesise that people may still be unaware about reservation policy and the process through which reservation is implemented. In the end-line, I embed a survey experiment to prime this information to approximately half of the respondents. I ask the same questions from baseline again to see whether priming this information changes citizen's explicit perceptions of democratic legitimacy and trust in the democratic system. Asking the same questions again also enables me to use the diff-in-diff estimator along with obtaining a difference in means estimate for these particular series of questions that are asked twice. Finally, I also examine reservation history at the polling booth level. At least 50% municipal wards were randomly reserved for women in both 2012 and 2017. However, due to border delimitation process in 2017 and unavailability of proper ward level maps for both 2012 and 2017 periods it is difficult to spatially merge these data at municipal ward level. Moreover, a majority of wards experienced a fair degree of change in borders. However it seems possible to merge the status of a polling station in both 2012 and 2017.

I disaggregate and measure political participation in general and context specific ways. I exploit the natural experiment of random quota assignment in Delhi municipal elections, where 50% wards were randomly reserved for women in 2012 and 2017. I embed a two wave panel survey of 1600+ HHs across 17 wards in Delhi within this natural experiment to examine the difference in levels of participation and gender gap between reserved and non-reserved wards. Apart from women's participation and gender gap outcomes, I examine whether quotas were able to mobilise both men and women in the context of anti-corruption protests, anti-rape/ sexual violence and environmental protests that have gripped Delhi since 2012 till date. Lastly, I embed a survey experiment to examine whether being informed about the quota policy has any effect on perceptions of inclusion and democratic accountability in the political system.", "q16": "I firstly exploit the natural experiment where 50% wards were reserved for women in 2017. I consider a ward treated if it was reserved for women in 2017. I use a two wave panel survey with an in-person baseline and end-line interview. The end-line is attempted after a washout period of 3 weeks. In the baseline I ask a series of questions on political participation, awareness, interest, agency, political engagement and partisanship in all wards. The outcome questions have been indicated in the excel sheet for both baseline and end-line survey. I expect the treated wards to have improved levels of political participation, awareness and engagement. I also expect that wards that are treated will record more political participation for causes related to women and environment for both men and women, relative to non-treated wards. In the end-line, I ask another series of questions on how people receive the information to participate, responses related to time, agency and resources to examine some of the causal mechanisms of why I expect treatment to improve political participation. Moreover, based on qualitative interviews with political party workers, I hypothesise that people may still be unaware about reservation policy and the process through which reservation is implemented. In the end-line, I embed a survey experiment to prime this information to approximately half of the respondents. I ask the same questions from baseline again to see whether priming this information changes citizen's explicit perceptions of democratic legitimacy and trust in the democratic system. Asking the same questions again also enables me to use the diff-in-diff estimator along with obtaining a difference in means estimate for these particular series of questions that are asked twice. Finally, I also examine reservation history at the polling booth level. At least 50% municipal wards were randomly reserved for women in both 2012 and 2017. However, due to border delimitation process in 2017 and unavailability of proper ward level maps for both 2012 and 2017 periods it is difficult to spatially merge these data at municipal ward level.
