These items were drawn from an original 10-item survey developed by our study team in consultation with local police officers. Exploratory factory analysis suggested a 3-component factor structure from these 8 items that assesses three categories of stressors that police officers may be exposed to on a daily basis. Component 1 assesses less frequent line-of-duty incidents involving arrests, exposure to trauma, and bodily harm, component 2 assesses routine daily stressors including paperwork, staffing shortages, and routine calls for service, and component 3 assesses interpersonal stressors from leadership and interactions with coworkers.

Furhter, this study aims to assess the association of stress beliefs with mental health symptoms and their treatment:\n3.\tResearch Questions \nIs the BASS a reliable and valid psychometric questionnaire to assess stress beliefs in patients with mental disorders? \n3.1\tCan the 3-dimensional factor structure of the BASS (negative, positive, and controllability beliefs) that emerged in a healthy population of university students (Laferton, Stenzel &amp; Fischer, 2018) be replicated in patients with mental disorders?\n3.2\tAre the BASS subscales reliable within psychotherapy outpatients?\n3.3\tCan measures of discriminant validity of BASS subscales with optimism, pessimism and trait negative affectivity that were reported in Laferton et al., (2018) be replicated? \n3.4\tAre more negative, less positive and controllability stress beliefs associated with increased psychopathological symptoms?\n3.5\tDo cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic outpatient treatment change stress beliefs?  \n3.6\tIs the change of stress beliefs during psychotherapy outpatient treatment associated with changes in mental health symptoms? \n3.7\tDo stress beliefs predict treatment outcome in outpatient psychotherapy?\n", "q4": "4.1\tWe hypothesize that a confirmatory factor analysis of the model formerly reported in the study of Laferton et al. (2018), with three correlated factors (positive stress beliefs, negative stress beliefs and controllability beliefs) will yield a good model fit to the data of the here investigated sample.\n4.2\tWe expect to confirm internal consistency values as reported in Laferton et al. (2018).\n4.3\t We expect to replicate findings of Laferton et al. (2018) regarding validity measures such that negative stress beliefs are negatively correlated to optimism and positively correlated to pessimism and negative affectivity (all small to medium effect sizes); positive stress beliefs are positively correlated to optimism and negatively correlated to pessimism and negative affectivity (all small to medium effect sizes); controllability beliefs are positively correlated to optimism and negatively correlated to pessimism and negative affectivity (medium to large effect sizes).\n4.4\tAt assessment before treatment, higher negative stress beliefs, lower positive stress beliefs and controllability beliefs are related to a higher global score of psychopathological symptoms, and especially to depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4.5\tDo patients\u2019 negative, positive and controllability stress beliefs (BASS) change during outpatient psychotherapy treatment (pre to post treatment). Do cognitive behavior therapy and psychodynamic therapy differentially influence changes in stress beliefs? \n4.6\tDifferences in BASS subscales measured before and after treatment predict changes in a global score of psychopathological symptoms, and especially depression and anxiety symptoms.\n4.7\tNegative, positive and controllability stress beliefs (BASS) predict changes in psychopathological symptoms, and especially depression and anxiety symptoms.\n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

In line with research on cumulative risk (Evans et al., 2013) each risk variable will be dichotomized to reflect either absence (= \u201c0\u201d) or presence (=\u201c1\u201d) of the peer stressor. With regard to peer victimization, in line with previous research (Oldenburg et al., 2015; Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003) adolescents will be classified as victims (= \u201c1\u201d) when they score 3 or higher on at least 1 experience of peer victimization (i.e., one of the 13 items); adolescents who score 1 (= \u201cnever\u201d) or 2 (\u201cone/two times\u201d) will be classified as not victimized.

The first item assessed general health (\u201c In general you could say your health is?\u201d) on a 5 point Likert scale that ranged from 1= bad to 5= excellent. The other five items assessed somatic symptoms and sleep quality. Somatic symptoms included headache, stomachache, loss of appetite and fatigue experienced in the last month. An example item is \u201cIn the past months, how many times did you have headaches?\u201d that could be answered with \u2018never (1 on the Likert scale), almost never, sometimes, often or very often (5 on the Likert scale)\u2019. Sleep quality was assessed with the item \u201cHow would you describe your sleep quality in the past month?\u201d This item could be answered on a 4 point Likert scale that ranged from 1= very bad to 4= very good.  \nBecause the somatic and sleep items were assessed on different metrics, we will make use of the proportion of maximum scaling (\u201cPOMS\u201d) method (Little, 2013) before combining all items in one overall scale. This method transforms each scale to a metric from 0 (=minimal possible) to 1 (=maximum possible), by first making the scale range from 0 to the highest value, and then dividing the scores by the highest value. POMS = [(observed \u2212 minimum)/(maximum \u2212 minimum)]. Finally, a physical health score will be computed by averaging the scores of the six items (general health, somatic symptoms and sleep quality). Internal consistency of the physical health construct will be assessed with Cronbach\u2019s alpha. \n\nIndependent variables (assessed at all 4 time points)\nPeer victimization was measured with the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire (RPEQ; Prinstein et al., 2001) including items of overt, relational and reputational peer victimization. This measure consists of thirteen statements (e.g. \u2018A peer hit, kicked or pushed me in a mean and harmful way\u2019) that were answered on a five point Likert scale from 1 (=never) to 5 (=a few times a week). A total peer victimization score will be computed at each time point by averaging across the 13 items, with higher scores indicating higher levels of peer victimization. \n\nPeer preference was measured with a peer nomination procedure. Adolescents nominated an unlimited number of same- and cross-gender peers within their grade whom they \u201clike the most\u201d (= acceptance) and \u201clike the least\u201d (= rejection; Coie &amp; Dodge, 1982). To ensure anonymity, adolescents were provided with a roster including all classmates and were asked to report the numbers associated with the classmates they wished to nominate on a separate questionnaire. We used the raw number of total nominations each participant received because in this study grade size was similar for the two schools and standardization within schools would eliminate information of between person differences across schools (Nezlek, 2012; Vel\u00e1squez et al., 2013). A peer preference score was computed by subtracting the \u201cliked least\u201d nominations from the \u201cliked most\u201d nominations (Cillessen &amp; Bukowski, 2018).\n\nPeer popularity was measured with the same peer nomination procedure as peer preference using the items \u201cmost popular\u201d (=popularity) and \u201cleast popular\u201d (=unpopularity). As for peer preference, we used the raw number of total nomination each participant received. A peer popularity score was computed by subtracting the \u201cleast popular\u201d nominations from the \u201cmost popular\u201d nominations (Cillessen &amp; Bukowski, 2018).\n\n\n"}, "conditions": {"extra": [], "value": "This is an observational study; therefore it does not include any (experimental) condition\n\n"}, "hypothesis": {"extra": [], "value": "Research question. This study aims to examine the unique, interactive and cumulative (within-person) effects of peer stressors (e.g., types of peer status and peer victimization) on physical health symptoms. Table 1 presents an overview of the expected associations for all models that will be tested. \nImportantly, hereby we formulate different hypotheses for two distinct types of peer status (i.e., peer preference and peer popularity), which could have different associations with physical health symptoms. In the unique-effect model, , we expect that low levels of peer preference would be associated with high levels of physical health symptoms (see de Bruine et al., 2019; Delfabbro et al., 2019; Temcheff et al., 2011). However, little research has examined the associations between peer popularity and health outcomes and existing findings are mixed. Therefore, we expect a quadratic association between peer popularity and physical health symptoms, based on work suggesting that both low and high levels of peer popularity may be stressful and pose risk for adjustment (e.g., Prinstein et al., 2011; Schwartz &amp; Gorman, 2011). In addition, we will explore an interaction-effect model, as it could be that the two types of peer status interact with one another to predict physical health symptoms. For example, it may be the case that those adolescents with high levels of peer popularity but low levels of peer preference are at highest risk for physical health complaints. Finally, we will test a cumulative risk model (Evans et al., 2013), according to which we expect that adolescents who experience multiple peer stressors (e.g., peer victimization and low peer preference) will report the most physical health symptoms.\n\nTo further explore the effects of peer victimization, peer preference and peer popularity on physical health symptoms we will examine not only within-person within-time associations but we will also explore whether these peer stressors influence physical health symptoms over time (i.e., -1 lagged effects). \n\n"}, "study_type": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational/archival study"}, "study_type_other": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"data": "It's complicated.

The first item assessed general health (\u201c In general you could say your health is?\u201d) on a 5 point Likert scale that ranged from 1= bad to 5= excellent. The other five items assessed somatic symptoms and sleep quality. Somatic symptoms included headache, stomachache, loss of appetite and fatigue experienced in the last month. An example item is \u201cIn the past months, how many times did you have headaches?\u201d that could be answered with \u2018never (1 on the Likert scale), almost never, sometimes, often or very often (5 on the Likert scale)\u2019. Sleep quality was assessed with the item \u201cHow would you describe your sleep quality in the past month?\u201d This item could be answered on a 4 point Likert scale that ranged from 1= very bad to 4= very good.  \nBecause the somatic and sleep items were assessed on different metrics, we will make use of the proportion of maximum scaling (\u201cPOMS\u201d) method (Little, 2013) before combining all items in one overall scale. This method transforms each scale to a metric from 0 (=minimal possible) to 1 (=maximum possible), by first making the scale range from 0 to the highest value, and then dividing the scores by the highest value. POMS = [(observed \u2212 minimum)/(maximum \u2212 minimum)]. Finally, a physical health score will be computed by averaging the scores of the six items (general health, somatic symptoms and sleep quality). Internal consistency of the physical health construct will be assessed with Cronbach\u2019s alpha. \n\nIndependent variables (assessed at all 4 time points)\nPeer victimization was measured with the Revised Peer Experiences Questionnaire (RPEQ; Prinstein et al., 2001) including items of overt, relational and reputational peer victimization. This measure consists of thirteen statements (e.g. \u2018A peer hit, kicked or pushed me in a mean and harmful way\u2019) that were answered on a five point Likert scale from 1 (=never) to 5 (=a few times a week). A total peer victimization score will be computed at each time point by averaging across the 13 items, with higher scores indicating higher levels of peer victimization. \n\nPeer preference was measured with a peer nomination procedure. Adolescents nominated an unlimited number of same- and cross-gender peers within their grade whom they \u201clike the most\u201d (= acceptance) and \u201clike the least\u201d (= rejection; Coie &amp; Dodge, 1982). To ensure anonymity, adolescents were provided with a roster including all classmates and were asked to report the numbers associated with the classmates they wished to nominate on a separate questionnaire. We used the raw number of total nominations each participant received because in this study grade size was similar for the two schools and standardization within schools would eliminate information of between person differences across schools (Nezlek, 2012; Vel\u00e1squez et al., 2013). A peer preference score was computed by subtracting the \u201cliked least\u201d nominations from the \u201cliked most\u201d nominations (Cillessen &amp; Bukowski, 2018).\n\nPeer popularity was measured with the same peer nomination procedure as peer preference using the items \u201cmost popular\u201d (=popularity) and \u201cleast popular\u201d (=unpopularity). As for peer preference, we used the raw number of total nomination each participant received. A peer popularity score was computed by subtracting the \u201cleast popular\u201d nominations from the \u201cmost popular\u201d nominations (Cillessen &amp; Bukowski, 2018).\n\n\n", "conditions": "This is an observational study; therefore it does not include any (experimental) condition\n\n", "hypothesis": "Research question. This study aims to examine the unique, interactive and cumulative (within-person) effects of peer stressors (e.g., types of peer status and peer victimization) on physical health symptoms. Table 1 presents an overview of the expected associations for all models that will be tested. \nImportantly, hereby we formulate different hypotheses for two distinct types of peer status (i.e., peer preference and peer popularity), which could have different associations with physical health symptoms. In the unique-effect model, , we expect that low levels of peer preference would be associated with high levels of physical health symptoms (see de Bruine et al., 2019; Delfabbro et al., 2019; Temcheff et al., 2011). However, little research has examined the associations between peer popularity and health outcomes and existing findings are mixed. Therefore, we expect a quadratic association between peer popularity and physical health symptoms, based on work suggesting that both low and high levels of peer popularity may be stressful and pose risk for adjustment (e.g., Prinstein et al., 2011; Schwartz &amp; Gorman, 2011). In addition, we will explore an interaction-effect model, as it could be that the two types of peer status interact with one another to predict physical health symptoms. For example, it may be the case that those adolescents with high levels of peer popularity but low levels of peer preference are at highest risk for physical health complaints. Finally, we will test a cumulative risk model (Evans et al., 2013), according to which we expect that adolescents who experience multiple peer stressors (e.g., peer victimization and low peer preference) will report the most physical health symptoms.\n\nTo further explore the effects of peer victimization, peer preference and peer popularity on physical health symptoms we will examine not only within-person within-time associations but we will also explore whether these peer stressors influence physical health symptoms over time (i.e., -1 lagged effects). \n\n", "study_type": "Observational/archival study"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=ctbmh", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ctbmh", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "ctbmh", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/twzr8/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "twzr8", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k3r8c/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "k3r8c", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/ctbmh/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/ctbmh/"}}, {"id": "mv26p", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Basel III &amp;
