Not only may the public have a hard time identifying fake news, but they may think other people are more vulnerable to it while failing to recognizing their own deficiencies ( Davison, 1983; Sun et al., 2008; Kruger & Dunning, 1999). Over-claiming understanding, knowledge, and competency is common and occurs across domains (Dunning, 2011). In some cases, the most inaccurate are among the most confident in their ignorance or more likely to believe they are well-informed (Kuklinski et al, 2000, Nyhan 2010, Hamilton 2018). When observed in domains concerning politics, this effect may be inflamed by the salience of partisanship (Anson, 2018). Due to ego-centric biases, people are also generally likely to see themselves as relatively more adept than others (Tal-Or et al., 2009). However, people may have some self-awareness of the support for their beliefs. For instance, when survey participants report greater certainty about their factual beliefs, those beliefs are more likely to be accurate than in cases when people express more uncertainty (Pasek, Sood, and Krosnick 2015; Graham 2018). Perceptions of people\u2019s vulnerabilities to fake news have not been rigorously examined by social scientists. These perceptions matter because of the behaviors they may encourage (e.g., Cohen and Tsfati, 2009; Tal-Or et al., 2009). If people incorrectly see themselves as skilled at identifying fake news, they may unwittingly consume more of it and more readily accept it. Descriptive survey findings suggest that Americans believe confusion caused by fake news is widespread but relatively few indicate they themselves have seen or shared it (Barthel, Mitchell, and Holcomb 2016). In this research, we therefore examine relationships between the perception and reality of fake news competency drawing on two related but rarely connected theoretical frameworks for understanding perceptual bias: the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger & Dunning, 1999) and third-person perception (Davison, 1983). Dunning-Kruger Effect First, we examine fake news in light of the Dunning-Kruger effect, which occurs when poor performers in social and intellectual domains appear unaware of their own deficiency (Kruger & Dunning, 1999). These poor performers suffer from a double-bind: their lack of expertise produces errors, and this same lack of expertise prevents recognition of these errors and awareness of others\u2019 better capabilities. Specifically, in studies of perception and performance, those in the bottom quarter of performers have tended to provide the most upwardly distorted self-perception. This pattern arises whether researchers elicit comparative self-evaluations (ratings of performance relative to peers) or self-evaluations using more \u201cabsolute\u201d scales (Dunning, 2011). By contrast, the most competent performers slightly underestimate their own ability relative to others due to a form of the false consensus effect (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977) \u2014 assuming others are performing more similarly to themselves than they really are. The overconfidence of under-performers is not erased by financial or social incentives (Ehrlinger et al., 2008), and it can serve as a basis for behavior (e.g., selecting insurance for exam performance; Ferraro, 2010). In other words, the misperceptions are genuinely believed rather than face-saving expressions of self-worth. The effect is more common when people have a reasonable reason to see themselves as knowledgeable or competent \u2014 i.e., the subject is not arcane and is prevalent in everyday life (Dunning, 2011). Judgment of the accuracy of news headlines is unlikely to be an exception (see, e.g., Motta et al. 2018 on vaccines). Why might a fake news Dunning-Kruger effect matter? The behavioral effects of high confidence and weak performance include resistance to help, training, and corrections (Dunning, 2011; Sheldon et al, 2014; see also Prasad et al., 2009; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Tabor et al., 2009). An incorrect view of one\u2019s ability to detect fake news might reduce the influence of new information about how to assess media items\u2019 credibility as well as willingness to engage with digital literacy programs, which could lead to a vicious spiral of exposure to low-credibility information. We further our understanding of the Dunning-Kruger effect in the news domain by examining its potential association with relevant behavior \u2014 whether the confidently incompetent unknowingly consume more dubious information in the real world \u2014 via web traffic data. Third-Person Perception We also examine perceptions of fake news vulnerability using the third-person effect framework, which focuses specifically on perceptions of media. Third-person perception \u2014 the belief that others will be more influenced by a message than one\u2019s self \u2014 is a prevalent form of perceptual bias (Davison, 1983; Sun et al., 2008). Applying the concept to our study, a third-person perception of fake news competency would be an inflated perception of relative competency versus that of others.^1 Studies show that individuals tend to see themselves as less susceptible to persuasion (Tal-Or et al., 2009, pp. 103-104), particularly from what they perceive as low-quality sources, and particularly when hypothetical consequences of a message are socially undesirable (Gunther and Mundy, 1993). We contribute to this literature in several ways. To date, only one study has examined third-person perceptions in fake news (Jang and Kim, 2018). While these authors focused on perceptions of fake news influence, we instead focus on perceptions of ability to detect fake news. This outcome measure more directly corresponds to concerns about the public\u2019s ability to discern the veracity of online news. Unlike perceptions of influence, our measure of perceived ability to identify fake news allows us to measure the accuracy of people\u2019s perceptions behaviorally. Our focus on perceptions of accuracy provides a behavioral baseline that is lacking in most analyses of third person perception (see Douglas and Sutton, 2004), which instead focus on the more nebulous concept of media \u201cinfluence.\u201d The design we employ allows us to compare people\u2019s perceived ability to detect fake news (which we measure using a mix of real and fake news story stimuli) with the general public. A third contribution is that we can assess the association between perceptions of news discernment ability and passively collected measures of partisan media and fake news exposure. This design will allow us to understand whether people who consume slanted or dubious information in the real world recognize their potential vulnerability to it. Fourth, research shows that people who are more highly engaged with a subject \u2014 for instance, partisans high in political knowledge and interest \u2014 exhibit stronger third-person bias (Perloff, 1989; Jang and Kim, 2018). We extend this finding by exploring whether there are partisan asymmetries in perceptual biases surrounding fake news (for a discussion of partisan asymmetries in media perceptions, see Hoffner and Rehkoff, 2011, p. 734). Such asymmetries may stem from elite discourse surrounding fake news (Van Duyn and Collier, 2018). Knowledgeable Republicans may view others as more vulnerable to fake news due to Trump\u2019s steady stream of messages about its prevalence. Conversely, knowledgeable Democrats may exhibit a stronger perceptual bias based on the preponderance of fake news favoring Trump (Guess et al., 2018), which they presumably reject. Given uncertainty about the potential moderating effects of these environmental conditions (Einstein and Glick, 2015), we pose this as a research question. Finally, we consider potentially undesirable side effects of media literacy interventions. Digital media literacy interventions often seek to improve the public\u2019s ability to spot fake news, but may unintentionally increase third-person perception by bolstering the recipient\u2019s self-confidence (see also Williams & Dunning, 2010). In doing so, these interventions could have negative effects downstream. For instance, they could create a form of \u201cinvulnerability bias,\u201d which could cause participants to voluntarily expose themselves to more low-credibility content (e.g., Douglas and Sutton, 2004) or to be less vigilant about the information they consume. We examine potential effects of a literacy intervention on perceptual bias using an embedded experiment. ^1: Both frameworks examine self-perceptions in the context of social comparisons (though Dunning-Kruger studies have also employed absolute scales). The measures typically employed differ, however. Dunning-Kruger studies that employ a social comparison measure ask for users to rate their relative performance as a percentile among all others\u2019. Third party perception studies ask respondent to rate themselves and separately ask them to rate others on Likert scales that can allow researchers to compare the two ratings. We collect perceptions of one\u2019s own ability and that of other Americans and compare these to behavioral baselines."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Third-person perception difference in the ability to recognize fake news H1. Respondents will, on average, be more confident in their \u201c own ability to recognize news that is made up\u201d than they are in \u201c Americans' ability to recognize news that is made up.\u201d They will also rate themselves on average above the 50th percentile in the ability to distinguish real from fake news. Descriptive analysis: Dunning-Kruger effect The Dunning-Kruger effect is widely misunderstood; it predicts that low performers will not recognize how poorly they performed in relative terms, not that low performers will think they perform best (see, e.g., Yarkoni 2010). We therefore do not expect that low performers will think they are the best at our task (distinguishing between real and fake news) and instead will measure the extent to which they do not recognize that they are worse than most others at the task. RQ1: To what extent will low performers (those who are least accurate in identifying real and fake news) overrate their ability to distinguish real from fake news? (i.e., express equal or greater confidence in their own ability to distinguish real from fake news compared to other Americans) Experimental effects Note: We have amended our pre-registration to reflect a programming error in the survey experiment conducted in this study (we discovered it after examining the data for 20181106AE, which was programmed nearly identically and contained the same error). Our news tips intervention was programmed such that all respondents were exposed. Accordingly, we have removed any hypotheses and models examining the effects of news tips from the set of pre-registered analyses below. For full transparency, we have used strikethrough formatting to show which hypotheses and analyses we have removed. We expect that exposure to a digital literacy intervention will increase confidence in one\u2019s own abilities relative to other Americans (who did not receive the intervention). We also propose a research question asking whether it could increase overconfidence by, for instance, making respondents more confident without actually improving their news literacy. Such a result could also occur if the intervention increases respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish real from fake news somewhat but has a greater effect on perceptions of their skills relative to others. H2. Respondents exposed to a fake news digital literacy intervention will report a larger gap between their confidence in their \u201cown ability\u201d and \u201cAmericans\u2019 ability\u201d to detect fake news (TPPFN) compared to those not exposed to an intervention. RQ2: Will exposure to a news tips intervention increase overconfidence in people\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news? Political/cognitive/demographic correlates RQ3. Are fake news exposure and partisan selective exposure associated with overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news and/or TPPFN? H3. Political interest, knowledge, and performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) will be positively associated with TPPFN. RQ4. How does TPPFN vary by party identification and political knowledge? RQ5. How do TPPFN and overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news vary by age? H4. Negative feelings toward the media (mass media trust, Facebook trust, media feelings) will be positively associated with TPPFN (see Tsfati and Cohen 2013, p. 12)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "[All of the survey items and the experimental protocol are attached below.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants are YouGov panel members in the U.S. who consented to participate in an online study (YouGov determines the specific eligibility and exclusion criteria for their panel). Researchers have no role in selecting the participants. The study was conducted in two waves. All measures below are from wave 1 except for the intent to vote and take political action measures. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news tips from Facebook (randomized with p=.5 via the YouGov platform). To measure fake news detection ability, 8 news articles for evaluation will be displayed according to the following logic: [16 possible articles: 4 pro-D real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 4 pro-R real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 2 pro-D fake news articles, 2 pro-R fake news articles, 2 pro-D hyperpartisan sources, 2 pro-R hyperpartisan sources] [show 8 articles from these sets in random order per algorithm below] Show 4 of 8 fake or hyperpartisan article previews: 1 pro-D hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-D fake {random from 2}, 1 pro-R hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-R fake {random from 2}. Each article\u2019s slant is listed in the attached survey document. Data collection and blinding Data will be collected via YouGov panel. Primary and secondary outcome measures Perceptions of absolute and relative ability We ask two questions in wave 1 that comprise our first measure of third-party perception, TPPFN_W1: -How confident are you in your own ability to recognize news that is made up? Are you very confident, somewhat confident, not very confident, or not at all confident? -Very confident (4) -Somewhat confident (3) -Not very confident (2) -Not at all confident (1) -How confident are you in Americans' ability to recognize news that is made up? Are you very confident, somewhat confident, not very confident, or not at all confident? -Very confident (4) -Somewhat confident (3) -Not very confident (2) -Not at all confident (1) TPP_FN1 is computed by subtracting the rating for Americans\u2019 ability from one\u2019s own ability, creating a variable which ranges from -3 to 3. We also ask two questions in wave 2 that directly measure differences in perceived ability to detect fake news compared to the public using a Dunning-Kruger-style approach: How do you think you compare to other Americans in your general ability to recognize news that is made up? Please respond using the scale below, where 1 means you're at the very bottom (worse than 99% of people) and 100 means you're at the very top (better than 99% of people). [1-100 slider] How do you think you compare to other Americans in how well you performed in this study at recognizing news that is made up? Please again respond using the scale below, where 1 means you're at the very bottom (worse than 99% of people) and 100 means you're at the very top (better than 99% of the people). [1-100 slider] If these measures are highly correlated as we expect, the variable TPPFN_W2 will take their average. (Otherwise, we will analyze them separately.) Accuracy of perceptions of relative ability Our measure of the accuracy of people\u2019s perceptions of relative ability is calculated by first calculating people\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news (see below) as mean(real news accuracy) - mean(fake news accuracy) in each wave. Respondents will be ordered by how well they distinguish real from fake news. We will then create the outcome variable overconfidence_w1 using responses from wave 1: 1=more confident in themselves than in Americans\u2019 ability to recognize news that is made up, below median on mean(real)-mean(fake) accuracy 0=equally confident in themselves and in Americans + those who accurately identify themselves as above or below the median -1=less confident in themselves than in Americans\u2019 ability to recognize news that is made up, above median on mean(real)-mean(fake) accuracy We will also create the outcome variable overconfidence_w2 using responses from wave 2: Percentile_estimated_in_this_study - percentile_actual where percentile_estimated equals their answer to the question above about perceived performance in this study and percentile_actual equals their actual estimated ranking on the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure in our sample in wave 2. High values indicate overconfidence so we therefore refer to this variable below as overconfidence (though negative values indicate underconfidence). (Note: We will assess the robustness of the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure to violations of a unidimensionality assumption and/or differential item difficulty and substitute a more complex measure using question fixed effects, IRT, etc. if appropriate.) Independent variables Fake news detection will be measured by respondent\u2019s average rating of accuracy of two fake news stories on a four-point scale. Real news detection will be measured by respondent average rating of accuracy of four real news stories on a four-point scale. Both will be measured using responses on wave 1. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the article you just read? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Political knowledge: Using the survey questions attached below, we will create a scale measuring political knowledge that ranges from 0 (no questions correct) to 8 (all questions correct). (Note: If results are consistent using the continuous knowledge scale or a median or tercile split then we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale measures in an appendix.) Political interest: -Most of the time (4) -Some of the time (3) -Only now and then (2) -Hardly at all (1) Media affect - feeling thermometer: 0-100 (DKs excluded): -The news media Mass media trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Facebook information trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Web behavior measures Pulse data We will code respondents\u2019 Pulse data for the seven days after they complete the Wave 1 survey as follows: \u25cf Mainstream news visit: One of AOL, ABC News, CBSNews.com, CNN.com, FiveThirtyEight, FoxNews.com, Huffington Post, MSN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, Politico, RealClearPolitics, Talking Points Memo, The Weekly Standard, WashingtonPost.com, WSJ.com, or Wikipedia \u25cf Fact-checking visit: PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet per above \u25cf Fake news visit: Any visit to one of the 673 domains identified in Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018 as a fake news producer as of September 2018 excluding those with print versions (including but not limited to Express, the British tabloid) and also domains that were previously classified by Bakshy et al. (2015) as a source of hard news. We will compute a binary measure of exposure to the types of content above as well as a count of the total webpages visited from each category during the period. We will code fake news visits as pro-Democrat (pro-Republican) if 60% or more of the visits by partisans (not including leaners) in our sample period are from Democrats (Republicans). We may also estimate the share of people\u2019s news diet from fake news websites as a share of hard news websites and fake news websites visited (using the definition above for fake news and the Bakshy et al. hard news topics classification). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. (For more detail, see the processing steps described in Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler N.d.) Finally, per Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018, we will include robustness tests in our appendix that replicate each of the hypothesis tests described below using only sites that appear on two or more of their source lists (116 of 673). Selective exposure tendencies: We will follow Guess et al. in dividing the sample by decile based on the overall average slant of the webpages they visit. (See article for details.) We will also include decile indicators for the period prior to the wave 1 survey as covariates in our observational analyses. (We will confirm that the results from the decile indicator controls are robust to an alternative estimation strategy proposed by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu of using kernel regression to estimate how the marginal effect of the average slant measure varies over its range [our decile indicators are a version of the binning strategy they also recommend].) Fake news exposure: We will measure binary and total fake news exposure using the definition above both overall and by whether it is pro- or counter-attitudinal (which we will code using respondent\u2019s partisan identity and the coding of the site described above). (If skew is too extreme for the count measure of total fake news exposure, we may use percentage of the news diet instead.) Statistical analyses In each model, we will include the following control variables: Indicators for Democrats and Republicans (0/1, each includes leaners), political knowledge (0-8) and interest (1-4), having a four-year college degree (0/1), self-identifying as a female (0/1) or non-white (0/1), and age-group dummies (30-44, 45-59, 60+, 18-29 omitted). Third-person perception difference in the ability to recognize fake news H1: We will conduct paired t t est between the means of confidence for \u201cown self\u201d and \u201cother Americans\u201d and a t t est for whether Americans\u2019 mean perceived performance in distinguishing real from fake news (TPPFN_W2) is equal to 50. Descriptive analysis: Dunning-Kruger effect RQ1: We will make two Dunning-Kruger-style graphs. The first will have quartiles of performance in distinguishing real from fake news in wave 1 (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) on the x-axis and mean TPPFN_W1 by group on the y-axis. The second graph will more closely approximate Dunning-Kruger by presenting quartiles of performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) in wave 2 on the x-axis and perceived quartile of performance on the y-axis. Other statistical models below will be estimated as using OLS with robust standard errors. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators when appropriate (see below). Given likely collinearity between groups of predictors, we will enter related predictors separately as well as estimating a combined omnibus model (when appropriate). Political/cognitive/demographic correlates RQ3. Are fake news exposure and partisan selective exposure associated with overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news and/or TPPFN? Overconfidence_w1 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above Overconfidence_w2 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above H3. Political interest, knowledge, and performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) will be positively associated with TPPFN. TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + political interest + political knowledge + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + political interest + political knowledge + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) RQ4. How does TPPFN vary by party identification and political knowledge? TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + Democrat + Republican + knowledge + Democrat X knowledge + Republican X knowledge TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + Democrat + Republican + knowledge + Democrat X knowledge + Republican X knowledge RQ5. How do TPPFN and overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news vary by age? TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + age + other covariates TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + age + other covariates Overconfidence_W1 = [constant] + age + other covariates Overconfidence_W2 = [constant] + age + other covariates (If one or more of our age dummy variables is significant, we will test for robustness using alternate codings of age including age as linear variable, age as linear variable plus an age-squared term, and alternate dummy codings of age.) H4. Negative feelings toward the media (mass media trust, Facebook trust, media feelings) will be positively associated with TPPFN (see Tsfati and Cohen 2013, p. 12). TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + mass media trust + FB trust + media FT + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + mass media trust + FB trust + media FT + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our sample. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -We will also produce descriptive statistics for our sample."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2857"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra":

Not only may the public have a hard time identifying fake news, but they may think other people are more vulnerable to it while failing to recognizing their own deficiencies ( Davison, 1983; Sun et al., 2008; Kruger & Dunning, 1999). Over-claiming understanding, knowledge, and competency is common and occurs across domains (Dunning, 2011). In some cases, the most inaccurate are among the most confident in their ignorance or more likely to believe they are well-informed (Kuklinski et al, 2000, Nyhan 2010, Hamilton 2018). When observed in domains concerning politics, this effect may be inflamed by the salience of partisanship (Anson, 2018). Due to ego-centric biases, people are also generally likely to see themselves as relatively more adept than others (Tal-Or et al., 2009). However, people may have some self-awareness of the support for their beliefs. For instance, when survey participants report greater certainty about their factual beliefs, those beliefs are more likely to be accurate than in cases when people express more uncertainty (Pasek, Sood, and Krosnick 2015; Graham 2018). Perceptions of people\u2019s vulnerabilities to fake news have not been rigorously examined by social scientists. These perceptions matter because of the behaviors they may encourage (e.g., Cohen and Tsfati, 2009; Tal-Or et al., 2009). If people incorrectly see themselves as skilled at identifying fake news, they may unwittingly consume more of it and more readily accept it. Descriptive survey findings suggest that Americans believe confusion caused by fake news is widespread but relatively few indicate they themselves have seen or shared it (Barthel, Mitchell, and Holcomb 2016). In this research, we therefore examine relationships between the perception and reality of fake news competency drawing on two related but rarely connected theoretical frameworks for understanding perceptual bias: the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger & Dunning, 1999) and third-person perception (Davison, 1983). Dunning-Kruger Effect First, we examine fake news in light of the Dunning-Kruger effect, which occurs when poor performers in social and intellectual domains appear unaware of their own deficiency (Kruger & Dunning, 1999). These poor performers suffer from a double-bind: their lack of expertise produces errors, and this same lack of expertise prevents recognition of these errors and awareness of others\u2019 better capabilities. Specifically, in studies of perception and performance, those in the bottom quarter of performers have tended to provide the most upwardly distorted self-perception. This pattern arises whether researchers elicit comparative self-evaluations (ratings of performance relative to peers) or self-evaluations using more \u201cabsolute\u201d scales (Dunning, 2011). By contrast, the most competent performers slightly underestimate their own ability relative to others due to a form of the false consensus effect (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977) \u2014 assuming others are performing more similarly to themselves than they really are. The overconfidence of under-performers is not erased by financial or social incentives (Ehrlinger et al., 2008), and it can serve as a basis for behavior (e.g., selecting insurance for exam performance; Ferraro, 2010). In other words, the misperceptions are genuinely believed rather than face-saving expressions of self-worth. The effect is more common when people have a reasonable reason to see themselves as knowledgeable or competent \u2014 i.e., the subject is not arcane and is prevalent in everyday life (Dunning, 2011). Judgment of the accuracy of news headlines is unlikely to be an exception (see, e.g., Motta et al. 2018 on vaccines). Why might a fake news Dunning-Kruger effect matter? The behavioral effects of high confidence and weak performance include resistance to help, training, and corrections (Dunning, 2011; Sheldon et al, 2014; see also Prasad et al., 2009; Nyhan & Reifler, 2010; Tabor et al., 2009). An incorrect view of one\u2019s ability to detect fake news might reduce the influence of new information about how to assess media items\u2019 credibility as well as willingness to engage with digital literacy programs, which could lead to a vicious spiral of exposure to low-credibility information. We further our understanding of the Dunning-Kruger effect in the news domain by examining its potential association with relevant behavior \u2014 whether the confidently incompetent unknowingly consume more dubious information in the real world \u2014 via web traffic data. Third-Person Perception We also examine perceptions of fake news vulnerability using the third-person effect framework, which focuses specifically on perceptions of media. Third-person perception \u2014 the belief that others will be more influenced by a message than one\u2019s self \u2014 is a prevalent form of perceptual bias (Davison, 1983; Sun et al., 2008). Applying the concept to our study, a third-person perception of fake news competency would be an inflated perception of relative competency versus that of others.^1 Studies show that individuals tend to see themselves as less susceptible to persuasion (Tal-Or et al., 2009, pp. 103-104), particularly from what they perceive as low-quality sources, and particularly when hypothetical consequences of a message are socially undesirable (Gunther and Mundy, 1993). We contribute to this literature in several ways. To date, only one study has examined third-person perceptions in fake news (Jang and Kim, 2018). While these authors focused on perceptions of fake news influence, we instead focus on perceptions of ability to detect fake news. This outcome measure more directly corresponds to concerns about the public\u2019s ability to discern the veracity of online news. Unlike perceptions of influence, our measure of perceived ability to identify fake news allows us to measure the accuracy of people\u2019s perceptions behaviorally. Our focus on perceptions of accuracy provides a behavioral baseline that is lacking in most analyses of third person perception (see Douglas and Sutton, 2004), which instead focus on the more nebulous concept of media \u201cinfluence.\u201d The design we employ allows us to compare people\u2019s perceived ability to detect fake news (which we measure using a mix of real and fake news story stimuli) with the general public. A third contribution is that we can assess the association between perceptions of news discernment ability and passively collected measures of partisan media and fake news exposure. This design will allow us to understand whether people who consume slanted or dubious information in the real world recognize their potential vulnerability to it. Fourth, research shows that people who are more highly engaged with a subject \u2014 for instance, partisans high in political knowledge and interest \u2014 exhibit stronger third-person bias (Perloff, 1989; Jang and Kim, 2018). We extend this finding by exploring whether there are partisan asymmetries in perceptual biases surrounding fake news (for a discussion of partisan asymmetries in media perceptions, see Hoffner and Rehkoff, 2011, p. 734). Such asymmetries may stem from elite discourse surrounding fake news (Van Duyn and Collier, 2018). Knowledgeable Republicans may view others as more vulnerable to fake news due to Trump\u2019s steady stream of messages about its prevalence. Conversely, knowledgeable Democrats may exhibit a stronger perceptual bias based on the preponderance of fake news favoring Trump (Guess et al., 2018), which they presumably reject. Given uncertainty about the potential moderating effects of these environmental conditions (Einstein and Glick, 2015), we pose this as a research question. Finally, we consider potentially undesirable side effects of media literacy interventions. Digital media literacy interventions often seek to improve the public\u2019s ability to spot fake news, but may unintentionally increase third-person perception by bolstering the recipient\u2019s self-confidence (see also Williams & Dunning, 2010). In doing so, these interventions could have negative effects downstream. For instance, they could create a form of \u201cinvulnerability bias,\u201d which could cause participants to voluntarily expose themselves to more low-credibility content (e.g., Douglas and Sutton, 2004) or to be less vigilant about the information they consume. We examine potential effects of a literacy intervention on perceptual bias using an embedded experiment. ^1: Both frameworks examine self-perceptions in the context of social comparisons (though Dunning-Kruger studies have also employed absolute scales). The measures typically employed differ, however. Dunning-Kruger studies that employ a social comparison measure ask for users to rate their relative performance as a percentile among all others\u2019. Third party perception studies ask respondent to rate themselves and separately ask them to rate others on Likert scales that can allow researchers to compare the two ratings. We collect perceptions of one\u2019s own ability and that of other Americans and compare these to behavioral baselines.", "q16": "Third-person perception difference in the ability to recognize fake news H1. Respondents will, on average, be more confident in their \u201c own ability to recognize news that is made up\u201d than they are in \u201c Americans' ability to recognize news that is made up.\u201d They will also rate themselves on average above the 50th percentile in the ability to distinguish real from fake news. Descriptive analysis: Dunning-Kruger effect The Dunning-Kruger effect is widely misunderstood; it predicts that low performers will not recognize how poorly they performed in relative terms, not that low performers will think they perform best (see, e.g., Yarkoni 2010). We therefore do not expect that low performers will think they are the best at our task (distinguishing between real and fake news) and instead will measure the extent to which they do not recognize that they are worse than most others at the task. RQ1: To what extent will low performers (those who are least accurate in identifying real and fake news) overrate their ability to distinguish real from fake news? (i.e., express equal or greater confidence in their own ability to distinguish real from fake news compared to other Americans) Experimental effects Note: We have amended our pre-registration to reflect a programming error in the survey experiment conducted in this study (we discovered it after examining the data for 20181106AE, which was programmed nearly identically and contained the same error). Our news tips intervention was programmed such that all respondents were exposed. Accordingly, we have removed any hypotheses and models examining the effects of news tips from the set of pre-registered analyses below. For full transparency, we have used strikethrough formatting to show which hypotheses and analyses we have removed. We expect that exposure to a digital literacy intervention will increase confidence in one\u2019s own abilities relative to other Americans (who did not receive the intervention). We also propose a research question asking whether it could increase overconfidence by, for instance, making respondents more confident without actually improving their news literacy. Such a result could also occur if the intervention increases respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish real from fake news somewhat but has a greater effect on perceptions of their skills relative to others. H2. Respondents exposed to a fake news digital literacy intervention will report a larger gap between their confidence in their \u201cown ability\u201d and \u201cAmericans\u2019 ability\u201d to detect fake news (TPPFN) compared to those not exposed to an intervention. RQ2: Will exposure to a news tips intervention increase overconfidence in people\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news? Political/cognitive/demographic correlates RQ3. Are fake news exposure and partisan selective exposure associated with overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news and/or TPPFN? H3. Political interest, knowledge, and performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) will be positively associated with TPPFN. RQ4. How does TPPFN vary by party identification and political knowledge? RQ5. How do TPPFN and overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news vary by age? H4. Negative feelings toward the media (mass media trust, Facebook trust, media feelings) will be positively associated with TPPFN (see Tsfati and Cohen 2013, p. 12).", "q17": "[All of the survey items and the experimental protocol are attached below.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants are YouGov panel members in the U.S. who consented to participate in an online study (YouGov determines the specific eligibility and exclusion criteria for their panel). Researchers have no role in selecting the participants. The study was conducted in two waves. All measures below are from wave 1 except for the intent to vote and take political action measures. Randomization approach We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news tips from Facebook (randomized with p=.5 via the YouGov platform). To measure fake news detection ability, 8 news articles for evaluation will be displayed according to the following logic: [16 possible articles: 4 pro-D real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 4 pro-R real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 2 pro-D fake news articles, 2 pro-R fake news articles, 2 pro-D hyperpartisan sources, 2 pro-R hyperpartisan sources] [show 8 articles from these sets in random order per algorithm below] Show 4 of 8 fake or hyperpartisan article previews: 1 pro-D hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-D fake {random from 2}, 1 pro-R hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-R fake {random from 2}. Each article\u2019s slant is listed in the attached survey document. Data collection and blinding Data will be collected via YouGov panel. Primary and secondary outcome measures Perceptions of absolute and relative ability We ask two questions in wave 1 that comprise our first measure of third-party perception, TPPFN_W1: -How confident are you in your own ability to recognize news that is made up? Are you very confident, somewhat confident, not very confident, or not at all confident? -Very confident (4) -Somewhat confident (3) -Not very confident (2) -Not at all confident (1) -How confident are you in Americans' ability to recognize news that is made up? Are you very confident, somewhat confident, not very confident, or not at all confident? -Very confident (4) -Somewhat confident (3) -Not very confident (2) -Not at all confident (1) TPP_FN1 is computed by subtracting the rating for Americans\u2019 ability from one\u2019s own ability, creating a variable which ranges from -3 to 3. We also ask two questions in wave 2 that directly measure differences in perceived ability to detect fake news compared to the public using a Dunning-Kruger-style approach: How do you think you compare to other Americans in your general ability to recognize news that is made up? Please respond using the scale below, where 1 means you're at the very bottom (worse than 99% of people) and 100 means you're at the very top (better than 99% of people). [1-100 slider] How do you think you compare to other Americans in how well you performed in this study at recognizing news that is made up? Please again respond using the scale below, where 1 means you're at the very bottom (worse than 99% of people) and 100 means you're at the very top (better than 99% of the people). [1-100 slider] If these measures are highly correlated as we expect, the variable TPPFN_W2 will take their average. (Otherwise, we will analyze them separately.) Accuracy of perceptions of relative ability Our measure of the accuracy of people\u2019s perceptions of relative ability is calculated by first calculating people\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news (see below) as mean(real news accuracy) - mean(fake news accuracy) in each wave. Respondents will be ordered by how well they distinguish real from fake news. We will then create the outcome variable overconfidence_w1 using responses from wave 1: 1=more confident in themselves than in Americans\u2019 ability to recognize news that is made up, below median on mean(real)-mean(fake) accuracy 0=equally confident in themselves and in Americans + those who accurately identify themselves as above or below the median -1=less confident in themselves than in Americans\u2019 ability to recognize news that is made up, above median on mean(real)-mean(fake) accuracy We will also create the outcome variable overconfidence_w2 using responses from wave 2: Percentile_estimated_in_this_study - percentile_actual where percentile_estimated equals their answer to the question above about perceived performance in this study and percentile_actual equals their actual estimated ranking on the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure in our sample in wave 2. High values indicate overconfidence so we therefore refer to this variable below as overconfidence (though negative values indicate underconfidence). (Note: We will assess the robustness of the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure to violations of a unidimensionality assumption and/or differential item difficulty and substitute a more complex measure using question fixed effects, IRT, etc. if appropriate.) Independent variables Fake news detection will be measured by respondent\u2019s average rating of accuracy of two fake news stories on a four-point scale. Real news detection will be measured by respondent average rating of accuracy of four real news stories on a four-point scale. Both will be measured using responses on wave 1. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the article you just read? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Political knowledge: Using the survey questions attached below, we will create a scale measuring political knowledge that ranges from 0 (no questions correct) to 8 (all questions correct). (Note: If results are consistent using the continuous knowledge scale or a median or tercile split then we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale measures in an appendix.) Political interest: -Most of the time (4) -Some of the time (3) -Only now and then (2) -Hardly at all (1) Media affect - feeling thermometer: 0-100 (DKs excluded): -The news media Mass media trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Facebook information trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Web behavior measures Pulse data We will code respondents\u2019 Pulse data for the seven days after they complete the Wave 1 survey as follows: \u25cf Mainstream news visit: One of AOL, ABC News, CBSNews.com, CNN.com, FiveThirtyEight, FoxNews.com, Huffington Post, MSN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, Politico, RealClearPolitics, Talking Points Memo, The Weekly Standard, WashingtonPost.com, WSJ.com, or Wikipedia \u25cf Fact-checking visit: PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet per above \u25cf Fake news visit: Any visit to one of the 673 domains identified in Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018 as a fake news producer as of September 2018 excluding those with print versions (including but not limited to Express, the British tabloid) and also domains that were previously classified by Bakshy et al. (2015) as a source of hard news. We will compute a binary measure of exposure to the types of content above as well as a count of the total webpages visited from each category during the period. We will code fake news visits as pro-Democrat (pro-Republican) if 60% or more of the visits by partisans (not including leaners) in our sample period are from Democrats (Republicans). We may also estimate the share of people\u2019s news diet from fake news websites as a share of hard news websites and fake news websites visited (using the definition above for fake news and the Bakshy et al. hard news topics classification). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. (For more detail, see the processing steps described in Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler N.d.) Finally, per Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018, we will include robustness tests in our appendix that replicate each of the hypothesis tests described below using only sites that appear on two or more of their source lists (116 of 673). Selective exposure tendencies: We will follow Guess et al. in dividing the sample by decile based on the overall average slant of the webpages they visit. (See article for details.) We will also include decile indicators for the period prior to the wave 1 survey as covariates in our observational analyses. (We will confirm that the results from the decile indicator controls are robust to an alternative estimation strategy proposed by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu of using kernel regression to estimate how the marginal effect of the average slant measure varies over its range [our decile indicators are a version of the binning strategy they also recommend].) Fake news exposure: We will measure binary and total fake news exposure using the definition above both overall and by whether it is pro- or counter-attitudinal (which we will code using respondent\u2019s partisan identity and the coding of the site described above). (If skew is too extreme for the count measure of total fake news exposure, we may use percentage of the news diet instead.) Statistical analyses In each model, we will include the following control variables: Indicators for Democrats and Republicans (0/1, each includes leaners), political knowledge (0-8) and interest (1-4), having a four-year college degree (0/1), self-identifying as a female (0/1) or non-white (0/1), and age-group dummies (30-44, 45-59, 60+, 18-29 omitted). Third-person perception difference in the ability to recognize fake news H1: We will conduct paired t t est between the means of confidence for \u201cown self\u201d and \u201cother Americans\u201d and a t t est for whether Americans\u2019 mean perceived performance in distinguishing real from fake news (TPPFN_W2) is equal to 50. Descriptive analysis: Dunning-Kruger effect RQ1: We will make two Dunning-Kruger-style graphs. The first will have quartiles of performance in distinguishing real from fake news in wave 1 (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) on the x-axis and mean TPPFN_W1 by group on the y-axis. The second graph will more closely approximate Dunning-Kruger by presenting quartiles of performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) in wave 2 on the x-axis and perceived quartile of performance on the y-axis. Other statistical models below will be estimated as using OLS with robust standard errors. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators when appropriate (see below). Given likely collinearity between groups of predictors, we will enter related predictors separately as well as estimating a combined omnibus model (when appropriate). Political/cognitive/demographic correlates RQ3. Are fake news exposure and partisan selective exposure associated with overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news and/or TPPFN? Overconfidence_w1 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above Overconfidence_w2 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet) + selective exposure decile indicators + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above H3. Political interest, knowledge, and performance in distinguishing real from fake news (i.e., lower perceived accuracy for fake news, higher perceived accuracy for real news) will be positively associated with TPPFN. TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + political interest + political knowledge + [mean(real news w1)-mean(fake news w1)] + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + political interest + political knowledge + [mean(real news w2)-mean(fake news w2)] + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) RQ4. How does TPPFN vary by party identification and political knowledge? TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + Democrat + Republican + knowledge + Democrat X knowledge + Republican X knowledge TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + Democrat + Republican + knowledge + Democrat X knowledge + Republican X knowledge RQ5. How do TPPFN and overconfidence in one\u2019s ability to distinguish real from fake news vary by age? TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + age + other covariates TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + age + other covariates Overconfidence_W1 = [constant] + age + other covariates Overconfidence_W2 = [constant] + age + other covariates (If one or more of our age dummy variables is significant, we will test for robustness using alternate codings of age including age as linear variable, age as linear variable plus an age-squared term, and alternate dummy codings of age.) H4. Negative feelings toward the media (mass media trust, Facebook trust, media feelings) will be positively associated with TPPFN (see Tsfati and Cohen 2013, p. 12). TPPFN_W1 = [constant] + mass media trust + FB trust + media FT + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) TPPFN_W2 = [constant] + mass media trust + FB trust + media FT + covariates listed above (separately and in omnibus) Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (N.d.) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our sample. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -We will also produce descriptive statistics for our sample.", "q18": "United States", "q19": "2857", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "Michigan HUM00153414, WUSTL 201806142

"value": "Despite widespread hype about the role of \u201cfake news\u201d in the 2016 election (e.g., Albright, 2017), actual consumption of fake news was limited and concentrated among a small set of people with strong tendencies toward selective exposure (Guess et al., 2018). Much remains to be learned about fake news, however. In particular, little is known about what effects it has on people\u2019s beliefs and attitudes or how we might best counteract it. One approach to countering fake news is to increase media literacy by training people to recognize fake news online (Kiely and Robertson, 2016; Caulfield, 2017; First Draft, 2017; Jang & Kim, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018). In the first wave of this study, we thus examine whether a news literacy intervention - showing people tips to help them spot fake news - can improve respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish between real and fake news (see also Blair et al. N.d., who find that fact-check banners help reduce the perceived accuracy of fake news but that general warnings about fake news decrease the perceived accuracy of both fake and real news). We also examine factors that may condition the effects of the intervention. One apparent danger of fake news is that mere exposure may increase its subsequent believability (Pennycook et al., 2018). We test this by manipulating prior exposure to fake news and evaluating whether articles that have been seen before are seen as more accurate. We also examine whether exposure to a news literacy intervention can limit this effect. Research on partisan media effects suggests that fake news exposure may also increase affective polarization and willingness to take political action (Garrett et al, 2014; Lau et al., 2017; Suhay et al., 2017; Tsfati & Nir, 2017). An experiment embedded in the second wave of this study therefore examines whether exposure to pro- or counter-attitudinal fake news changes levels of affective polarization, affect toward the media, and intent to engage in political action. Finally, we explore the potential for individual differences in fake news effects."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Note: We have amended our pre-registration to reflect a programming error in the survey experiment conducted in this study (we discovered it after examining the data for 20181106AE, which was programmed nearly identically and contained the same error). Our news tips intervention was programmed such that all respondents were exposed. Accordingly, we have removed any hypotheses and models examining the effects of news tips from the set of pre-registered analyses below. For full transparency, we have used strikethrough formatting to show which hypotheses and analyses we have removed. Wave 1 We plan to test the following hypotheses using survey data from Wave 1 and behavioral data on the web traffic patterns of respondents: A. Observational hypotheses H-A1) People with the strongest overall tendencies toward selective exposure will be the most likely to consume fake news and consume the most on average. (This hypothesis tests if the Guess et al. results replicate in this sample.) H-A2) People who consume fake news will be more likely to believe it is accurate than those who do not consume fake news (H-A2a). This relationship will be stronger for pro-attitudinal fake news belief than for counter-attitudinal fake news belief (H-A2b) and for people who are relatively less skilled at analytical reasoning (H-A2c). We also expect that people who consume fake news will be less likely to successfully distinguish between true and false headlines (H-A2d). H-A3) People who consume fake news will be more likely to hold topical misperceptions than those who do not consume fake news (H-A3a). This relationship will be stronger for pro-attitudinal misperceptions than for counter-attitudinal misperceptions (H-A3b) and for people who are relatively less skilled at analytical reasoning (H-A3c). People who consume fake news will be less likely to successfully distinguish between true and false topical statements (H-A3d). We will provide the first test of the general association between exposure to fake news sites and belief in both fake news headlines and topical misperceptions. This relationship is likely to vary by whether the content of the fake news is consistent with respondents\u2019 political viewpoint. We will examine fake news exposure\u2019s relationship with perceived accuracy of related, true, topical statements as a baseline. (Note: We cannot prove that any such relationship is causal but can evaluate whether respondents who view fake news indicate that they believe in the fake news headlines or topical misperceptions.) Additionally, some research is suggestive that older respondents consume more fake news (Guess et al n.d.) and are less able to separate factual statements from opinion statements (Gottfried and Greico 2018). To more directly assess whether age plays a role in how people evaluate news, we propose the following RQ-A1: Is there a relationship between respondent age and perceived accuracy of fake news? B. Main effects of news tips intervention Exposure to tips for spotting fake news should do the following: H-B1a) The news tips intervention will decrease the perceived accuracy of fake news. (It should help people identify clues that the article is dubious.) H-B1b) The news tips intervention will increase the perceived accuracy of real news. (It should help people identify clues of credibility and/or generate a contrast effect with fake news articles.) H-B1c) The news tips intervention will increase people\u2019s ability to successfully distinguish between real and fake news. (This implication follows from H-B1a and H-B1b.) H-B1d) The news tips intervention will decrease the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan news. RQ-B1) Does exposure to the news tips intervention affect subsequent information consumption? We will test whether respondents assigned to the news tips condition are less likely to visit fake news websites than those assigned to control (RQ-B1a). We will also test whether respondents assigned to the news tips condition are more likely to visit fact-checking websites (RQ-B1b), and mainstream news websites (RQ-B1c) those assigned to control. RQ-B2) What effects will the news tips intervention have on intention to share fake, real, or hyper-partisan news? Respondents should presumably be less likely to share fake and hyper-partisan news and more likely to share real news, but Pennycook and Rand find that prior exposure to an accuracy question - the same measurement approach used in our design - suppresses self-reported sharing intentions. The effects of the intervention in this context are therefore unclear. C. Heterogeneous treatment effects H-C1) The effect of the news tips intervention will be reduced for pro-attitudinal content compared to counter-attitudinal content. (Based on prior findings showing greater vulnerability to pro-attitudinal misinformation (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010), we expect that respondents will improve less at distinguishing false from real news in response to the intervention when the content in question is consistent with their predispositions; see also, e.g., Metzger, Hartsell, and Flanagin 2015.) In addition, we will also conduct exploratory analysis of other potential moderators of the effect of news tips on the perceived accuracy of real and fake news: Cognitive Reflection Test scores (per Pennycook and Rand 2018, but see Kahan 2018), trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump, conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites. Given the risk of false positives, we will control the false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. These analyses will be limited to the appendix or supplementary materials, but if any positive findings replicate in future studies, we may then use these data and analyses in the main text of a paper. Waves 1-2 D) Effects of prior exposure to fake news and news tips intervention We also examine whether exposure to either fake news or the news tips intervention have lingering effects over time. We replicate Pennycook et al. (2018), who show a single exposure to fake news increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy. H-D1. Randomized exposure to a fake news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. H-D2. Randomized exposure to a real news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. H-D3. Randomized exposure to a hyper-partisan news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. We also test whether exposure to the news tips intervention changes this effect. RQ-D1. Does exposure to the news tips intervention affect perceived accuracy of fake news story repeated in Wave 2? RQ-D2-D5. Are any main effects of the news tips intervention on belief in real news (RQ-D2), fake news (RQ-D3), the ability of people to distinguish between real and fake news (RQ-D4), and on belief in hyperpartisan news (RQ-D5) measurable in wave 2? Wave 2 E) Main effects of fake news exposure H-E1a. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase affective polarization. (Exposure to online criticism of the other party has been found to increase affective polarization (Suhay et al. 2017). Related evidence finds that partisan media can potentially also increase ideological polarization, although the extent of these effects and the groups that are affected remains an ongoing area of research (e.g., Arceneaux and Johnson 2013; Levendusky 2013; see Iyengar et al. N.d. and Prior 2013 for reviews).) H-E1b. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase negative feelings toward the media. (Ladd 2011 finds that exposure to elite media criticism and tabloid-style news increase media distrust, as does talk radio exposure among conservatives. During the 2016 election, fake news often amplified attacks on the mainstream media and used tabloid- and talk radio-style approaches.) H-E2/E3. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase intent to vote (H-E2) and intent to take political action (H-E3). Negative affect toward the other party, which much fake news promotes, is increasingly associated with political participation (Iyengar and Krupenkin 2018). Similarly, though advertising does not seem to affect net turnout levels, changes in the partisan balance of advertising affect partisan vote shares (Spenkuch and Toniatti, 2018). Finally, exposure to Fox News was found to particularly increase vote intention among Republicans and independents (Hopkins and Ladd 2014). H-E4/E5. Exposure to fake news will increase belief in the claims in the articles in question (H-E4), especially among respondents for whom those articles are pro-attitudinal (H-E5). RQ-E1. Commentators have suggested that attacks on George Soros appeal to and promote anti-Semitic views (e.g., Ackerman 2018). We therefore examine whether exposure to a fake news article attributing the caravan to him promotes more negative sentiment toward Jews overall (RQ-E1a) or among Republicans for whom the article is pro-attitudinal (RQ-E1b). F) Heterogeneous treatment effects RQ-F1-4. What effect does counter-attitudinal fake news exposure have on affective polarization (RQ-F1), affect toward the media (RQ-F2), intent to vote (RQ-F3), or intent to take political action (RQ-F4)? (Research and commentary has largely focused on the effect of pro-attitudinal fake news exposure. Theoretical expectations about the effects of counter-attitudinal fake news exposure are less clear. It could have a persuasive effect as with Fox, which appears to have increased Republican vote share in part through persuasion (though conversion rates were low; see Hopkins and Ladd 2014 and Martin and Yurukoglu 2017). Alternatively, it could generate backlash, as persuasion efforts frequently fail (e.g., Bailey, Hopkins, and Rogers 2016). These effects could apply to both attitudes (affective polarization) and behavioral intentions (intent to vote or take political action). We will also conduct exploratory analyses of potential moderators of the effect of pro-attitudinal fake news on affective polarization, intent to vote, or intent to take political action: trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump (entered as a linear term and with indicators for terciles or quartiles), conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites. In addition, we will conduct exploratory analyses of Hispanic/Latino-white differences in feeling thermometer scores as a moderator of fake news exposure effects for the immigrant caravan stimulus and Christian-Muslim differences in feeling thermometer scores as a moderator of fake news exposure effects for the Khashoggi stimulus in wave 2. As we describe above for wave 1, we will control the false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure given the risk of false positives. These analyses will be limited to the appendix or supplementary materials, but if any positive findings replicate in future studies, we may then use these data and analyses in the main text of a paper."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "[All of the survey items and the experimental protocol are attached below.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants are YouGov panel members in the U.S. who consented to participate in an online study (YouGov determines the specific eligibility and exclusion criteria for their panel). Researchers have no role in selecting the participants. Randomization approach (wave 1) We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news tips from Facebook (randomized with p=.5 via the YouGov platform). 8 news articles for evaluation will be displayed according to the following logic: [16 possible articles: 4 pro-D real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 4 pro-R real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 2 pro-D fake news articles, 2 pro-R fake news articles, 2 pro-D hyperpartisan sources, 2 pro-R hyperpartisan sources] [show 8 articles from these sets in random order per algorithm below] Show 4 of 8 fake or hyperpartisan article previews: 1 pro-D hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-D fake {random from 2}, 1 pro-R hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-R fake {random from 2}. Each article\u2019s slant is listed in the survey document below. In wave 2, all participants will subsequently be exposed to all 16 possible articles from wave 1, thus providing perceptions of accuracy for repeated and non-repeated articles. Randomization approach (wave 2) We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news/hyper-partisan article via the YouGov platform (p=1/3 pro-D fake news article, 1/3 pro-R fake news article, 1/3 placebo). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected by YouGov via the survey waves described above and anonymized web traffic data from respondents (see Guess et al. for details on the YouGov Pulse panel, though the tracking technology and panel have changed since 2016). Primary and secondary outcome measures Waves 1 and 2 (survey) Our primary outcome measures in wave 1 are the perceived accuracy of the claims that were shown in headlines to respondents (from either real, fake, or hyperpartisan news sites). These are also among the primary outcome measures in wave 2. The wording of these questions appears below. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim in the above headline? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish between real and fake will be measured as the mean perceived accuracy of real headlines minus the mean perceived accuracy of fake headlines. (See the attached instrument, which indicates which articles are real, fake, or hyperpartisan, and which are coded as pro-Republican versus pro-Democrat. We will assess the robustness of the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure to violations of a unidimensionality assumption and/or differential item difficulty and substitute a more complex measure using question fixed effects, IRT, etc. if appropriate.) A secondary outcome measure is self-reported intention to \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d an article on Facebook: [If How frequently do you use Facebook? != Never] How likely would you be to \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d this article in your Facebook News Feed? -Not at all likely (1) -Not very likely (2) -Somewhat likely (3) -Very likely (4) We also include questions about topical misperceptions to test our observational hypotheses about prior exposure to misinformation or fake news. We have coded partisan favorability of these statements. We include one false and one true statement favorable to each party. The wording and coding appears below. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate are the following statements? Each one concerns the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, in a Senate hearing. The audience at a public rally laughed when Trump mocked gaps in Ford\u2019s testimony. (true, pro-R) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Ford\u2019s allegations were refuted by the people she says were present during the assault. (false, pro-R) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Ford\u2019s high school classmates recall hearing the story about the alleged assault at the time. (false, pro-D) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight in college. (true, pro-D) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Wave 2 (survey) Wave 2 also includes a number of primary outcome measures. First, we measure beliefs in the claims promoted in the two fake news stimulus articles: The international financier and philanthropist George Soros has helped to support the caravan of more than 7,000 Central American migrants that is currently moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) The Trump administration helped Saudi Arabia to target Jamal Khashoggi, the writer for The Washington Post who was recently killed by Saudi agents. -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Second, we measure affective polarization: Feeling thermometers: -Democratic Party (0-100) -Republican Party (0-100) Affective polarization is calculated as the difference between in-party and out-party ratings. When examining affective polarization, in addition to the difference between in- and out-party ratings, we will also model in-party and out-party ratings independently and report the results separately. Third, we measure feelings toward the media using a feeling thermometer (0-100). Fourth, we measure affect toward Jews using a feeling thermometer (0-100). We also measure voting/intent to vote and to take political action. First, we measure respondents\u2019 self-reported voting/intention to vote in the 2018 midterm election: Have you already voted in the upcoming midterm election? -Yes (5) -No (if no) Do you, yourself, plan to vote in the upcoming midterm election, or not? -Yes -No (1) -Don\u2019t know (2) (if yes) How certain are you that you will vote? -Absolutely certain (4) -Fairly certain (3) -Not certain (2) Due to uncertainty about the proper coding of respondents who are not registered or who answer don\u2019t know, we will also analyze a binary measure of intent to vote where 1=already voted/absolutely certain and 0=all other responses. Intent to take political action is measured as the mean of the following five ANES items: -I would be willing to place a bumper sticker on my car or wear a campaign button -I would be willing to volunteer to work for a political campaign -I would be willing to attend a political rally -I would be willing to talk to other people about how they should vote -I would be willing to donate money to a political campaign -Agree strongly (5) -Agree somewhat (4) -Neither agree nor disagree (3) -Disagree somewhat (2) -Disagree strongly (1) Pulse data We will code respondents\u2019 Pulse data for the seven days after they complete the Wave 1 survey as follows: \u25cf Mainstream news visit: One of AOL, ABC News, CBSNews.com, CNN.com, FiveThirtyEight, FoxNews.com, Huffington Post, MSN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, Politico, RealClearPolitics, Talking Points Memo, The Weekly Standard, WashingtonPost.com, WSJ.com, or Wikipedia \u25cf Fact-checking visit: PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet per above \u25cf Fake news visit: Any visit to one of the 673 domains identified in Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018 as a fake news producer as of September 2018 excluding those with print versions (including but not limited to Express, the British tabloid) and also domains that were previously classified by Bakshy et al. (2015) as a source of hard news. We will compute a binary measure of exposure to the types of content above as well as a count of the total webpages visited from each category during the period. We will code fake news visits as pro-Democrat (pro-Republican) if 60% or more of the visits by partisans (not including leaners) in our sample period are from Democrats (Republicans). We may also estimate the share of people\u2019s news diet from fake news websites as a share of hard news websites and fake news websites visited (using the definition above for fake news and the Bakshy et al. hard news topics classification). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de- duplication. (For more detail, see the processing steps described in Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler N.d.) Finally, per Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018, we will include robustness tests in our appendix that replicate each of the hypothesis tests described below using only sites that appear on two or more of their source lists (116 of 673). Independent variables Congeniality: We coded news content as pro-Republican or pro-Democrat; we cross this coding with a measure of respondent partisanship to determine if content is congenial (1) or uncongenial (0). (Models including measures of whether content is congenial will omit pure independents for whom this variable is undefined. To provide a strict comparison, we will sometimes estimate main effects models for the set of partisans included in these models.) Partisanship: We will create two dichotomous independent variables (0/1) for those who identify with the Democratic and Republican parties including leaners (based on ANES party ID questions from the YouGov panel). Cognitive reflection/analytical thinking and reasoning will be measured by taking the total score on the three-item standard Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) (Frederick, 2005), using alternate wording (Patel, 2017), and the four-item non-numeric CRT-2 (Thomson, 2016). Both will be presented in multiple choice format (Patel, 2017) with the intuitive but incorrect choice listed first. Correct responses will be scored as 1 and all other responses as 0 and the answer summed. Reliability will be calculated for the combined scale. Political interest: -Most of the time (4) -Some of the time (3) -Only now and then (2) -Hardly at all (1) Political knowledge: Using the survey questions attached below, we will create a scale measuring political knowledge that ranges from 0 (no questions correct) to 8 (all questions correct). Democrat (0/1): if they indicated they identify as a Democrat or lean toward the Democratic Party Republican (0/1): if they indicated they identify as a Republican or lean toward the Republican Party Feelings toward Trump and the media (0-100) Media trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Conspiracy predispositions - mean of four items: -Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places. -Even though we live in a democracy, a few people will always run things anyway. -The people who really 'run' the country are not known to the voter. -Big events like wars, recessions, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by small groups of people who are working in secret against the rest of us. -Strongly agree (5) -Somewhat agree (4) -Neither disagree nor disagree (3) -Somewhat disagree (2) -Strongly disagree (1) Reliability will be calculated for the combined scale. Fake news exposure: We will measure binary and total fake news exposure using the definition above both overall and by whether it is pro- or counter-attitudinal (which we will code using respondent\u2019s partisan identity and the coding of the site described above). (If skew is too extreme for the count measure of total fake news exposure, we may use percentage of the news diet instead.) A measure of total fake news exposure prior to wave 1 will also be included as a covariate in tests of H-A4a - H-A4d to make the selection on observables assumption more plausible. (Any exposure to topical misinformation on fake news sites will be excluded from this total.) Selective exposure tendencies: We will follow Guess et al. in dividing the sample by decile based on the overall average slant of the webpages they visit. (See article for details.) We will also include decile indicators for the period prior to the wave 1 survey as covariates in our observational analyses. (We will confirm that the results from the decile indicator controls are robust to an alternative estimation strategy proposed by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu of using kernel regression to estimate how the marginal effect of the average slant measure varies over its range [our decile indicators are a version of the binning strategy they also recommend].) Finally, we will also include controls in our observational models for Democrats and Republicans (including leaners), political knowledge (0-8) and interest (1-4), having a four-year college degree (0/1), self-identifying as a female (0/1) or non-white (0/1), and age group dummies (30-44, 45-59, 60+, 18-29 omitted). Statistical analyses All headline-level results will be estimated as pooled models using OLS with robust standard errors clustered by respondent and will include question fixed effects (to control for the overall level of credibility of each article) in addition to the covariates specified below. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). Models that include indicators for congenial beliefs will omit question fixed effects due to collinearity. For outcomes that are measured at the respondent level rather than the respondent-question level, question fixed effects and clustering will be omitted. For each hypothesis or RQ below describing a series of identical models for real, fake, and hyperpartisan news, we will be estimate the models separately for expositional reasons but will also estimate a pooled model with interactions to determine if there are differences in treatment effects by news type. (These models will include news type dummies and appropriate interactions rather than question fixed effects.) Observational hypotheses For H-A1, the outcome measure is exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet): Fake news exposure = [constant] + selective exposure decile indicators + covariates listed above For H-A2a, H-A2b, and H-A2c, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines: H-A2a: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A2b: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake + news exposure * congenial + covariates listed above H-A2c: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake + news exposure * CRT score + covariates listed above For H-A2d, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news headlines - mean perceived accuracy of fake news headlines). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). For H-A3a, H-A3b, and H-A3c, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of true and false topical statements. These models will be estimated separately for wave 1 and wave 2 topical misperceptions. For each of these types of statements in wave 1, we will estimate the following models: H-A3a: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3b: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake news exposure * congenial + covariates listed above H-A3c: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake news exposure * CRT score + covariates listed above For H-A3d, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of true statements - mean perceived accuracy of false statements). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above For wave 2, we will control for treatment assignment in the models described above: H-A3a: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3b: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake news exposure * congenial + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3c: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake news exposure * CRT score + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3d: Outcome = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above Main effects of news tips intervention For H-B1a, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines. For H-B1b, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of real headlines. For H-B1d, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. For RQ-B1, the outcome measures are binary measures and counts of visits to fake news websites (RQ-B1a), fact-checking websites (RQ-B1b), and mainstream news websites (RQ-B1c). For RQ-B2, the outcome measures are self-reported intention to share real, fake, and hyper-partisan news. For each of these question-level hypotheses, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit or count models as appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + News tips For H-B1c, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news - mean perceived accuracy of fake news). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + News tips Heterogeneous treatment effects For H-C1, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake, real, and hyper-partisan headlines. For each of these types of headlines, we will estimate the following model: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Congenial + News tips*congeniality We will also explore question-level results to test for asymmetry. So for each question we will estimate the model: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Party FE + News tips*party FE For the exploratory analyses of possible moderators (Cognitive Reflection Test scores (per Pennycook and Rand 2018), trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump, conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites), the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake, real, and hyper-partisan headlines. Our focus will be on whether the results from our analysis of H-B1a, H-B1b, and H-B1d above are moderated by these individual differences. That is, we want to see if the effect is moderated when the outcome is the (1) perceived accuracy of fake headlines, (2) the perceived accuracy of the real headlines, and (3) the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. Thus we will be looking at how each of the potential moderators interacts with the treatments for all three of the outcomes specified above. Due to likely collinearity between the predictors, we will estimate separate models of perceived accuracy for each potential moderator. e.g.: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Political interest + News tips*political interest Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Congenial + Political interest + News tips*political interest + Congenial*political interest + News tips*congenial + News tips*congenial*political interest Waves 1-2 For H-D1, RQ-D1, and RQ-D2, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines in Wave 2. For H-D2 and RQ-D3, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of real headlines For H-D3 and RQ-D4, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. To test the effects of wave 1 exposure (H-D1-H-D3) Outcome = [constant] + wave 1 exposure For RQ-D1, the the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines in Wave 2, but we will test if the treatment is moderated by exposure to the news tips in Wave 1. Outcome = [constant] + wave 1 exposure + News tips + wave 1*News tips For the question-level hypotheses RQ-D2, RQ-D3, and RQ-D5, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit as appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + News tips For RQ-D4, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news - mean perceived accuracy of fake news). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + News tips Main effects of fake news exposure For H-E1a and RQ-F1, the outcome measure is affective polarization. For H-E1b and RQ-F2, the outcome measure is affect toward the media. For H-E2 and RQ-F3, the outcome measure is intent to vote. For H-E3 and RQ-F4, the outcome measure is the intent to take political action scale. For each of these hypotheses, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit where appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure For H-E4, the outcome measures are beliefs in the Soros/caravan and Trump/Khashoggi conspiracy theories. We will test the main effect of the articles on beliefs in these claims using separate OLS regressions for each outcome measure: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Khashoggi article fake news exposure For RQ-E1a, the outcome measure is feelings toward Jews. We will test the main effect of the article using OLS regression: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Khashoggi article fake news exposure Heterogeneous treatment effects For the exploratory analyses of possible moderators of the effects of congenial fake news exposure, the outcome measures are affective polarization, intent to vote, intent to take political action, trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump (entered as a linear term and with indicators for terciles or quartiles), conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites, and Hispanic/Latino-white and Christian-Muslim differences in feeling thermometer scores. Due to likely collinearity between the predictors, we will estimate separate models for each potential moderator for each outcome measure. E.g.: Outcome = [constant] + congenial fake news exposure + feelings toward Trump + congenial fake news exposure * feelings toward Trump + uncongenial fake news exposure For H-E5, the outcome measures are beliefs in the Soros/caravan and Trump/Khashoggi conspiracy theories. We will test if the effects of fake news articles on these beliefs vary by whether the article is pro-attitudinal using separate OLS regressions among Democrats or Republicans defined using the coding above: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Trump Khashoggi article fake news exposure + Republican + caravan*Republican + Khashoggi*Republican For RQ-E1b, we will also test if the effects of caravan article exposure vary by whether the article is pro-attitudinal using OLS regression among Democrats or Republicans defined using the coding above: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Trump Khashoggi article fake news exposure + Republican + caravan*Republican + Khashoggi*Republican Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (forthcoming) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our sample. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered or count dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit or Poisson regression with standard errors, respectively. -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. We will select covariates from the list below using the lasso before estimating the model using OLS per the procedures described in Bloniarz et al. 2016. Candidate covariates for all models: -average media slant value from the period prior to wave 1 (measured per Guess et al. N.d.) -decile indicators for average media slant from the period prior to wave 1 (measured per Guess et al. N.d.) -indicators for Democrats and Republicans (including leaners) -gender -age groups (30-44, 45-59, 60+) -non-white respondents -respondents with a four-year college degree -scores on standard political knowledge and interest scales -Trump feeling thermometer from wave 1 -Media feeling thermometer from wave 1 -Trust in the media in wave 1 -Affective polarization in wave 1 (in-party feelings - out-party feelings) -Conspiracy predispositions scale (average response in wave 1) Added covariate for wave 2 belief accuracy outcome models: -lagged average belief accuracy from wave 1 for each type of outcome measure (e.g., average accuracy of pro-Republican fake news in wave 1 for analysis of perceived accuracy of pro-Republican fake news in wave 2; applies to all real/fake/hyperpartisan news types) -We will test for differential attrition between survey waves by examining the relationship between completion of wave 2 and wave 1 treatment assignment. This is our primary measure of attrition. If we observe significant differential attrition based on condition, we will use a strategy such as the one proposed by Aronow et al. to account for missing outcome variables in a randomized experiment (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2305788). We will also test for attrition based on the following observable characteristics: -media trust, media feelings, and average fake news belief in wave 1 -political characteristics (partisanship and political knowledge) -demographic characteristics (race, sex, and age) Due to the large number of characteristics on which we will assess imbalance, we will use a correction for multiple comparisons. Attrition that is unrelated to random assignment should not confound our treatment effect estimates but is worth noting for the reader and potentially addressing in any observational data analyses. -In addition to OLS with robust standard errors and question fixed effects, we will also fit a non-nested hierarchical model with the same covariates. -We will also compute and report descriptive statistics for our data to summarize sample characteristics, response variable distributions, etc."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2857"}, "q20":

the 2016 election (e.g., Albright, 2017), actual consumption of fake news was limited and concentrated among a small set of people with strong tendencies toward selective exposure (Guess et al., 2018). Much remains to be learned about fake news, however. In particular, little is known about what effects it has on people\u2019s beliefs and attitudes or how we might best counteract it. One approach to countering fake news is to increase media literacy by training people to recognize fake news online (Kiely and Robertson, 2016; Caulfield, 2017; First Draft, 2017; Jang & Kim, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018). In the first wave of this study, we thus examine whether a news literacy intervention - showing people tips to help them spot fake news - can improve respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish between real and fake news (see also Blair et al. N.d., who find that fact-check banners help reduce the perceived accuracy of fake news but that general warnings about fake news decrease the perceived accuracy of both fake and real news). We also examine factors that may condition the effects of the intervention. One apparent danger of fake news is that mere exposure may increase its subsequent believability (Pennycook et al., 2018). We test this by manipulating prior exposure to fake news and evaluating whether articles that have been seen before are seen as more accurate. We also examine whether exposure to a news literacy intervention can limit this effect. Research on partisan media effects suggests that fake news exposure may also increase affective polarization and willingness to take political action (Garrett et al, 2014; Lau et al., 2017; Suhay et al., 2017; Tsfati & Nir, 2017). An experiment embedded in the second wave of this study therefore examines whether exposure to pro- or counter-attitudinal fake news changes levels of affective polarization, affect toward the media, and intent to engage in political action. Finally, we explore the potential for individual differences in fake news effects.", "q16": "Note: We have amended our pre-registration to reflect a programming error in the survey experiment conducted in this study (we discovered it after examining the data for 20181106AE, which was programmed nearly identically and contained the same error). Our news tips intervention was programmed such that all respondents were exposed. Accordingly, we have removed any hypotheses and models examining the effects of news tips from the set of pre-registered analyses below. For full transparency, we have used strikethrough formatting to show which hypotheses and analyses we have removed. Wave 1 We plan to test the following hypotheses using survey data from Wave 1 and behavioral data on the web traffic patterns of respondents: A. Observational hypotheses H-A1) People with the strongest overall tendencies toward selective exposure will be the most likely to consume fake news and consume the most on average. (This hypothesis tests if the Guess et al. results replicate in this sample.) H-A2) People who consume fake news will be more likely to believe it is accurate than those who do not consume fake news (H-A2a). This relationship will be stronger for pro-attitudinal fake news belief than for counter-attitudinal fake news belief (H-A2b) and for people who are relatively less skilled at analytical reasoning (H-A2c). We also expect that people who consume fake news will be less likely to successfully distinguish between true and false headlines (H-A2d). H-A3) People who consume fake news will be more likely to hold topical misperceptions than those who do not consume fake news (H-A3a). This relationship will be stronger for pro-attitudinal misperceptions than for counter-attitudinal misperceptions (H-A3b) and for people who are relatively less skilled at analytical reasoning (H-A3c). People who consume fake news will be less likely to successfully distinguish between true and false topical statements (H-A3d). We will provide the first test of the general association between exposure to fake news sites and belief in both fake news headlines and topical misperceptions. This relationship is likely to vary by whether the content of the fake news is consistent with respondents\u2019 political viewpoint. We will examine fake news exposure\u2019s relationship with perceived accuracy of related, true, topical statements as a baseline. (Note: We cannot prove that any such relationship is causal but can evaluate whether respondents who view fake news indicate that they believe in the fake news headlines or topical misperceptions.) Additionally, some research is suggestive that older respondents consume more fake news (Guess et al n.d.) and are less able to separate factual statements from opinion statements (Gottfried and Greico 2018). To more directly assess whether age plays a role in how people evaluate news, we propose the following RQ-A1: Is there a relationship between respondent age and perceived accuracy of fake news? B. Main effects of news tips intervention Exposure to tips for spotting fake news should do the following: H-B1a) The news tips intervention will decrease the perceived accuracy of fake news. (It should help people identify clues that the article is dubious.) H-B1b) The news tips intervention will increase the perceived accuracy of real news. (It should help people identify clues of credibility and/or generate a contrast effect with fake news articles.) H-B1c) The news tips intervention will increase people\u2019s ability to successfully distinguish between real and fake news. (This implication follows from H-B1a and H-B1b.) H-B1d) The news tips intervention will decrease the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan news. RQ-B1) Does exposure to the news tips intervention affect subsequent information consumption? We will test whether respondents assigned to the news tips condition are less likely to visit fake news websites than those assigned to control (RQ-B1a). We will also test whether respondents assigned to the news tips condition are more likely to visit fact-checking websites (RQ-B1b), and mainstream news websites (RQ-B1c) those assigned to control. RQ-B2) What effects will the news tips intervention have on intention to share fake, real, or hyper-partisan news? Respondents should presumably be less likely to share fake and hyper-partisan news and more likely to share real news, but Pennycook and Rand find that prior exposure to an accuracy question - the same measurement approach used in our design - suppresses self-reported sharing intentions. The effects of the intervention in this context are therefore unclear. C. Heterogeneous treatment effects H-C1) The effect of the news tips intervention will be reduced for pro-attitudinal content compared to counter-attitudinal content. (Based on prior findings showing greater vulnerability to pro-attitudinal misinformation (e.g., Nyhan and Reifler 2010), we expect that respondents will improve less at distinguishing false from real news in response to the intervention when the content in question is consistent with their predispositions; see also, e.g., Metzger, Hartsell, and Flanagin 2015.) In addition, we will also conduct exploratory analysis of other potential moderators of the effect of news tips on the perceived accuracy of real and fake news: Cognitive Reflection Test scores (per Pennycook and Rand 2018, but see Kahan 2018), trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump, conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites. Given the risk of false positives, we will control the false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. These analyses will be limited to the appendix or supplementary materials, but if any positive findings replicate in future studies, we may then use these data and analyses in the main text of a paper. Waves 1-2 D) Effects of prior exposure to fake news and news tips intervention We also examine whether exposure to either fake news or the news tips intervention have lingering effects over time. We replicate Pennycook et al. (2018), who show a single exposure to fake news increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy. H-D1. Randomized exposure to a fake news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. H-D2. Randomized exposure to a real news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. H-D3. Randomized exposure to a hyper-partisan news story in Wave 1 increases the perceived accuracy of those stories in Wave 2. We also test whether exposure to the news tips intervention changes this effect. RQ-D1. Does exposure to the news tips intervention affect perceived accuracy of fake news story repeated in Wave 2? RQ-D2-D5. Are any main effects of the news tips intervention on belief in real news (RQ-D2), fake news (RQ-D3), the ability of people to distinguish between real and fake news (RQ-D4), and on belief in hyperpartisan news (RQ-D5) measurable in wave 2? Wave 2 E) Main effects of fake news exposure H-E1a. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase affective polarization. (Exposure to online criticism of the other party has been found to increase affective polarization (Suhay et al. 2017). Related evidence finds that partisan media can potentially also increase ideological polarization, although the extent of these effects and the groups that are affected remains an ongoing area of research (e.g., Arceneaux and Johnson 2013; Levendusky 2013; see Iyengar et al. N.d. and Prior 2013 for reviews).) H-E1b. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase negative feelings toward the media. (Ladd 2011 finds that exposure to elite media criticism and tabloid-style news increase media distrust, as does talk radio exposure among conservatives. During the 2016 election, fake news often amplified attacks on the mainstream media and used tabloid- and talk radio-style approaches.) H-E2/E3. Exposure to pro-attitudinal fake news will increase intent to vote (H-E2) and intent to take political action (H-E3). Negative affect toward the other party, which much fake news promotes, is increasingly associated with political participation (Iyengar and Krupenkin 2018). Similarly, though advertising does not seem to affect net turnout levels, changes in the partisan balance of advertising affect partisan vote shares (Spenkuch and Toniatti, 2018). Finally, exposure to Fox News was found to particularly increase vote intention among Republicans and independents (Hopkins and Ladd 2014). H-E4/E5. Exposure to fake news will increase belief in the claims in the articles in question (H-E4), especially among respondents for whom those articles are pro-attitudinal (H-E5). RQ-E1. Commentators have suggested that attacks on George Soros appeal to and promote anti-Semitic views (e.g., Ackerman 2018). We therefore examine whether exposure to a fake news article attributing the caravan to him promotes more negative sentiment toward Jews overall (RQ-E1a) or among Republicans for whom the article is pro-attitudinal (RQ-E1b). F) Heterogeneous treatment effects RQ-F1-4. What effect does counter-attitudinal fake news exposure have on affective polarization (RQ-F1), affect toward the media (RQ-F2), intent to vote (RQ-F3), or intent to take political action (RQ-F4)? (Research and commentary has largely focused on the effect of pro-attitudinal fake news exposure. Theoretical expectations about the effects of counter-attitudinal fake news exposure are less clear. It could have a persuasive effect as with Fox, which appears to have increased Republican vote share in part through persuasion (though conversion rates were low; see Hopkins and Ladd 2014 and Martin and Yurukoglu 2017). Alternatively, it could generate backlash, as persuasion efforts frequently fail (e.g., Bailey, Hopkins, and Rogers 2016). These effects could apply to both attitudes (affective polarization) and behavioral intentions (intent to vote or take political action). We will also conduct exploratory analyses of potential moderators of the effect of pro-attitudinal fake news on affective polarization, intent to vote, or intent to take political action: trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump (entered as a linear term and with indicators for terciles or quartiles), conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites. In addition, we will conduct exploratory analyses of Hispanic/Latino-white differences in feeling thermometer scores as a moderator of fake news exposure effects for the immigrant caravan stimulus and Christian-Muslim differences in feeling thermometer scores as a moderator of fake news exposure effects for the Khashoggi stimulus in wave 2. As we describe above for wave 1, we will control the false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure given the risk of false positives. These analyses will be limited to the appendix or supplementary materials, but if any positive findings replicate in future studies, we may then use these data and analyses in the main text of a paper.", "q17": "[All of the survey items and the experimental protocol are attached below.] Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants Participants are YouGov panel members in the U.S. who consented to participate in an online study (YouGov determines the specific eligibility and exclusion criteria for their panel). Researchers have no role in selecting the participants. Randomization approach (wave 1) We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news tips from Facebook (randomized with p=.5 via the YouGov platform). 8 news articles for evaluation will be displayed according to the following logic: [16 possible articles: 4 pro-D real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 4 pro-R real news articles (2 from low-prominence sources and 2 from high-prominence sources), 2 pro-D fake news articles, 2 pro-R fake news articles, 2 pro-D hyperpartisan sources, 2 pro-R hyperpartisan sources] [show 8 articles from these sets in random order per algorithm below] Show 4 of 8 fake or hyperpartisan article previews: 1 pro-D hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-D fake {random from 2}, 1 pro-R hyper {random from 2}, 1 pro-R fake {random from 2}. Each article\u2019s slant is listed in the survey document below. In wave 2, all participants will subsequently be exposed to all 16 possible articles from wave 1, thus providing perceptions of accuracy for repeated and non-repeated articles. Randomization approach (wave 2) We will use a between-subjects design in which respondents are randomly assigned to exposure to fake news/hyper-partisan article via the YouGov platform (p=1/3 pro-D fake news article, 1/3 pro-R fake news article, 1/3 placebo). Data collection and blinding Data will be collected by YouGov via the survey waves described above and anonymized web traffic data from respondents (see Guess et al. for details on the YouGov Pulse panel, though the tracking technology and panel have changed since 2016). Primary and secondary outcome measures Waves 1 and 2 (survey) Our primary outcome measures in wave 1 are the perceived accuracy of the claims that were shown in headlines to respondents (from either real, fake, or hyperpartisan news sites). These are also among the primary outcome measures in wave 2. The wording of these questions appears below. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate is the claim in the above headline? -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Respondents\u2019 ability to distinguish between real and fake will be measured as the mean perceived accuracy of real headlines minus the mean perceived accuracy of fake headlines. (See the attached instrument, which indicates which articles are real, fake, or hyperpartisan, and which are coded as pro-Republican versus pro-Democrat. We will assess the robustness of the mean(real)-mean(fake) measure to violations of a unidimensionality assumption and/or differential item difficulty and substitute a more complex measure using question fixed effects, IRT, etc. if appropriate.) A secondary outcome measure is self-reported intention to \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d an article on Facebook: [If How frequently do you use Facebook? != Never] How likely would you be to \u201clike\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d this article in your Facebook News Feed? -Not at all likely (1) -Not very likely (2) -Somewhat likely (3) -Very likely (4) We also include questions about topical misperceptions to test our observational hypotheses about prior exposure to misinformation or fake news. We have coded partisan favorability of these statements. We include one false and one true statement favorable to each party. The wording and coding appears below. To the best of your knowledge, how accurate are the following statements? Each one concerns the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, in a Senate hearing. The audience at a public rally laughed when Trump mocked gaps in Ford\u2019s testimony. (true, pro-R) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Ford\u2019s allegations were refuted by the people she says were present during the assault. (false, pro-R) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Ford\u2019s high school classmates recall hearing the story about the alleged assault at the time. (false, pro-D) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight in college. (true, pro-D) -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Wave 2 (survey) Wave 2 also includes a number of primary outcome measures. First, we measure beliefs in the claims promoted in the two fake news stimulus articles: The international financier and philanthropist George Soros has helped to support the caravan of more than 7,000 Central American migrants that is currently moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) The Trump administration helped Saudi Arabia to target Jamal Khashoggi, the writer for The Washington Post who was recently killed by Saudi agents. -Not at all accurate (1) -Not very accurate (2) -Somewhat accurate (3) -Very accurate (4) Second, we measure affective polarization: Feeling thermometers: -Democratic Party (0-100) -Republican Party (0-100) Affective polarization is calculated as the difference between in-party and out-party ratings. When examining affective polarization, in addition to the difference between in- and out-party ratings, we will also model in-party and out-party ratings independently and report the results separately. Third, we measure feelings toward the media using a feeling thermometer (0-100). Fourth, we measure affect toward Jews using a feeling thermometer (0-100). We also measure voting/intent to vote and to take political action. First, we measure respondents\u2019 self-reported voting/intention to vote in the 2018 midterm election: Have you already voted in the upcoming midterm election? -Yes (5) -No (if no) Do you, yourself, plan to vote in the upcoming midterm election, or not? -Yes -No (1) -Don\u2019t know (2) (if yes) How certain are you that you will vote? -Absolutely certain (4) -Fairly certain (3) -Not certain (2) Due to uncertainty about the proper coding of respondents who are not registered or who answer don\u2019t know, we will also analyze a binary measure of intent to vote where 1=already voted/absolutely certain and 0=all other responses. Intent to take political action is measured as the mean of the following five ANES items: -I would be willing to place a bumper sticker on my car or wear a campaign button -I would be willing to volunteer to work for a political campaign -I would be willing to attend a political rally -I would be willing to talk to other people about how they should vote -I would be willing to donate money to a political campaign -Agree strongly (5) -Agree somewhat (4) -Neither agree nor disagree (3) -Disagree somewhat (2) -Disagree strongly (1) Pulse data We will code respondents\u2019 Pulse data for the seven days after they complete the Wave 1 survey as follows: \u25cf Mainstream news visit: One of AOL, ABC News, CBSNews.com, CNN.com, FiveThirtyEight, FoxNews.com, Huffington Post, MSN.com, NBCNews.com, NYTimes.com, Politico, RealClearPolitics, Talking Points Memo, The Weekly Standard, WashingtonPost.com, WSJ.com, or Wikipedia \u25cf Fact-checking visit: PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet per above \u25cf Fake news visit: Any visit to one of the 673 domains identified in Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018 as a fake news producer as of September 2018 excluding those with print versions (including but not limited to Express, the British tabloid) and also domains that were previously classified by Bakshy et al. (2015) as a source of hard news. We will compute a binary measure of exposure to the types of content above as well as a count of the total webpages visited from each category during the period. We will code fake news visits as pro-Democrat (pro-Republican) if 60% or more of the visits by partisans (not including leaners) in our sample period are from Democrats (Republicans). We may also estimate the share of people\u2019s news diet from fake news websites as a share of hard news websites and fake news websites visited (using the definition above for fake news and the Bakshy et al. hard news topics classification). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de- duplication. (For more detail, see the processing steps described in Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler N.d.) Finally, per Allcott, Gentzkow, and Yu 2018, we will include robustness tests in our appendix that replicate each of the hypothesis tests described below using only sites that appear on two or more of their source lists (116 of 673). Independent variables Congeniality: We coded news content as pro-Republican or pro-Democrat; we cross this coding with a measure of respondent partisanship to determine if content is congenial (1) or uncongenial (0). (Models including measures of whether content is congenial will omit pure independents for whom this variable is undefined. To provide a strict comparison, we will sometimes estimate main effects models for the set of partisans included in these models.) Partisanship: We will create two dichotomous independent variables (0/1) for those who identify with the Democratic and Republican parties including leaners (based on ANES party ID questions from the YouGov panel). Cognitive reflection/analytical thinking and reasoning will be measured by taking the total score on the three-item standard Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) (Frederick, 2005), using alternate wording (Patel, 2017), and the four-item non-numeric CRT-2 (Thomson, 2016). Both will be presented in multiple choice format (Patel, 2017) with the intuitive but incorrect choice listed first. Correct responses will be scored as 1 and all other responses as 0 and the answer summed. Reliability will be calculated for the combined scale. Political interest: -Most of the time (4) -Some of the time (3) -Only now and then (2) -Hardly at all (1) Political knowledge: Using the survey questions attached below, we will create a scale measuring political knowledge that ranges from 0 (no questions correct) to 8 (all questions correct). Democrat (0/1): if they indicated they identify as a Democrat or lean toward the Democratic Party Republican (0/1): if they indicated they identify as a Republican or lean toward the Republican Party Feelings toward Trump and the media (0-100) Media trust and confidence: -A great deal (4) -A fair amount (3) -Not very much (2) -None at all (1) Conspiracy predispositions - mean of four items: -Much of our lives are being controlled by plots hatched in secret places. -Even though we live in a democracy, a few people will always run things anyway. -The people who really 'run' the country are not known to the voter. -Big events like wars, recessions, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by small groups of people who are working in secret against the rest of us. -Strongly agree (5) -Somewhat agree (4) -Neither disagree nor disagree (3) -Somewhat disagree (2) -Strongly disagree (1) Reliability will be calculated for the combined scale. Fake news exposure: We will measure binary and total fake news exposure using the definition above both overall and by whether it is pro- or counter-attitudinal (which we will code using respondent\u2019s partisan identity and the coding of the site described above). (If skew is too extreme for the count measure of total fake news exposure, we may use percentage of the news diet instead.) A measure of total fake news exposure prior to wave 1 will also be included as a covariate in tests of H-A4a - H-A4d to make the selection on observables assumption more plausible. (Any exposure to topical misinformation on fake news sites will be excluded from this total.) Selective exposure tendencies: We will follow Guess et al. in dividing the sample by decile based on the overall average slant of the webpages they visit. (See article for details.) We will also include decile indicators for the period prior to the wave 1 survey as covariates in our observational analyses. (We will confirm that the results from the decile indicator controls are robust to an alternative estimation strategy proposed by Hainmueller, Mummolo, and Xu of using kernel regression to estimate how the marginal effect of the average slant measure varies over its range [our decile indicators are a version of the binning strategy they also recommend].) Finally, we will also include controls in our observational models for Democrats and Republicans (including leaners), political knowledge (0-8) and interest (1-4), having a four-year college degree (0/1), self-identifying as a female (0/1) or non-white (0/1), and age group dummies (30-44, 45-59, 60+, 18-29 omitted). Statistical analyses All headline-level results will be estimated as pooled models using OLS with robust standard errors clustered by respondent and will include question fixed effects (to control for the overall level of credibility of each article) in addition to the covariates specified below. These results will be verified for robustness using appropriate GLM estimators (see below). Models that include indicators for congenial beliefs will omit question fixed effects due to collinearity. For outcomes that are measured at the respondent level rather than the respondent-question level, question fixed effects and clustering will be omitted. For each hypothesis or RQ below describing a series of identical models for real, fake, and hyperpartisan news, we will be estimate the models separately for expositional reasons but will also estimate a pooled model with interactions to determine if there are differences in treatment effects by news type. (These models will include news type dummies and appropriate interactions rather than question fixed effects.) Observational hypotheses For H-A1, the outcome measure is exposure to fake news (binary/count/share of information diet): Fake news exposure = [constant] + selective exposure decile indicators + covariates listed above For H-A2a, H-A2b, and H-A2c, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines: H-A2a: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A2b: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake + news exposure * congenial + covariates listed above H-A2c: Fake news accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake + news exposure * CRT score + covariates listed above For H-A2d, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news headlines - mean perceived accuracy of fake news headlines). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). For H-A3a, H-A3b, and H-A3c, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of true and false topical statements. These models will be estimated separately for wave 1 and wave 2 topical misperceptions. For each of these types of statements in wave 1, we will estimate the following models: H-A3a: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3b: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake news exposure * congenial + covariates listed above H-A3c: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake news exposure * CRT score + covariates listed above For H-A3d, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of true statements - mean perceived accuracy of false statements). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + covariates listed above For wave 2, we will control for treatment assignment in the models described above: H-A3a: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3b: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial + prior fake news exposure * congenial + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3c: Accuracy = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + CRT score + prior fake news exposure * CRT score + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above H-A3d: Outcome = [constant] + prior fake news exposure + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure + covariates listed above Main effects of news tips intervention For H-B1a, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines. For H-B1b, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of real headlines. For H-B1d, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. For RQ-B1, the outcome measures are binary measures and counts of visits to fake news websites (RQ-B1a), fact-checking websites (RQ-B1b), and mainstream news websites (RQ-B1c). For RQ-B2, the outcome measures are self-reported intention to share real, fake, and hyper-partisan news. For each of these question-level hypotheses, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit or count models as appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + News tips For H-B1c, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news - mean perceived accuracy of fake news). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + News tips Heterogeneous treatment effects For H-C1, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake, real, and hyper-partisan headlines. For each of these types of headlines, we will estimate the following model: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Congenial + News tips*congeniality We will also explore question-level results to test for asymmetry. So for each question we will estimate the model: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Party FE + News tips*party FE For the exploratory analyses of possible moderators (Cognitive Reflection Test scores (per Pennycook and Rand 2018), trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump, conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, and pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites), the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake, real, and hyper-partisan headlines. Our focus will be on whether the results from our analysis of H-B1a, H-B1b, and H-B1d above are moderated by these individual differences. That is, we want to see if the effect is moderated when the outcome is the (1) perceived accuracy of fake headlines, (2) the perceived accuracy of the real headlines, and (3) the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. Thus we will be looking at how each of the potential moderators interacts with the treatments for all three of the outcomes specified above. Due to likely collinearity between the predictors, we will estimate separate models of perceived accuracy for each potential moderator. e.g.: Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Political interest + News tips*political interest Outcome = [constant] + News tips + Congenial + Political interest + News tips*political interest + Congenial*political interest + News tips*congenial + News tips*congenial*political interest Waves 1-2 For H-D1, RQ-D1, and RQ-D2, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines in Wave 2. For H-D2 and RQ-D3, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of real headlines For H-D3 and RQ-D4, the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of hyper-partisan headlines. To test the effects of wave 1 exposure (H-D1-H-D3) Outcome = [constant] + wave 1 exposure For RQ-D1, the the outcome measure is the perceived accuracy of fake headlines in Wave 2, but we will test if the treatment is moderated by exposure to the news tips in Wave 1. Outcome = [constant] + wave 1 exposure + News tips + wave 1*News tips For the question-level hypotheses RQ-D2, RQ-D3, and RQ-D5, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit as appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + News tips For RQ-D4, the outcome measure = (mean perceived accuracy of real news - mean perceived accuracy of fake news). This hypothesis is measured at the respondent level using a single mean difference that is not ordered and thus we will only test it using OLS with robust standard errors (i.e., no question fixed effects or clustering). Outcome = [constant] + News tips Main effects of fake news exposure For H-E1a and RQ-F1, the outcome measure is affective polarization. For H-E1b and RQ-F2, the outcome measure is affect toward the media. For H-E2 and RQ-F3, the outcome measure is intent to vote. For H-E3 and RQ-F4, the outcome measure is the intent to take political action scale. For each of these hypotheses, we will estimate the following model using OLS regression (with robustness checks using ordered probit where appropriate): Outcome = [constant] + congenial fake news exposure + uncongenial fake news exposure For H-E4, the outcome measures are beliefs in the Soros/caravan and Trump/Khashoggi conspiracy theories. We will test the main effect of the articles on beliefs in these claims using separate OLS regressions for each outcome measure: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Khashoggi article fake news exposure For RQ-E1a, the outcome measure is feelings toward Jews. We will test the main effect of the article using OLS regression: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Khashoggi article fake news exposure Heterogeneous treatment effects For the exploratory analyses of possible moderators of the effects of congenial fake news exposure, the outcome measures are affective polarization, intent to vote, intent to take political action, trust in and feelings toward the media, feelings toward Trump (entered as a linear term and with indicators for terciles or quartiles), conspiracy predispositions, political interest and knowledge, pre-treatment visits to fake news sites and fact-checking sites, and Hispanic/Latino-white and Christian-Muslim differences in feeling thermometer scores. Due to likely collinearity between the predictors, we will estimate separate models for each potential moderator for each outcome measure. E.g.: Outcome = [constant] + congenial fake news exposure + feelings toward Trump + congenial fake news exposure * feelings toward Trump + uncongenial fake news exposure For H-E5, the outcome measures are beliefs in the Soros/caravan and Trump/Khashoggi conspiracy theories. We will test if the effects of fake news articles on these beliefs vary by whether the article is pro-attitudinal using separate OLS regressions among Democrats or Republicans defined using the coding above: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Trump Khashoggi article fake news exposure + Republican + caravan*Republican + Khashoggi*Republican For RQ-E1b, we will also test if the effects of caravan article exposure vary by whether the article is pro-attitudinal using OLS regression among Democrats or Republicans defined using the coding above: Outcome = [constant] + caravan article fake news exposure + Trump Khashoggi article fake news exposure + Republican + caravan*Republican + Khashoggi*Republican Notes: -We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models to test the hypotheses of interest, including marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from the models including interaction terms, treatment effects by subgroup, and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. -In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. -For interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will also use tercile indicators to test whether a linearity assumption holds for any interactions with continuous moderators per Hainmueller et al (forthcoming) and replace any continuous interactions in our models with them if it does not. -We will compute and report summary statistics for our sample. We will also collect and may report response timing data as a proxy for respondent attention. -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered or count dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit or Poisson regression with standard errors, respectively. -We may estimate the experimental models described above with a standard set of covariates if including those has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. We will select covariates from the list below using the lasso before estimating the model using OLS per the procedures described in Bloniarz et al. 2016. Candidate covariates for all models: -average media slant value from the period prior to wave 1 (measured per Guess et al. N.d.) -decile indicators for average media slant from the period prior to wave 1 (measured per Guess et al. N.d.) -indicators for Democrats and Republicans (including leaners) -gender -age groups (30-44, 45-59, 60+) -non-white respondents -respondents with a four-year college degree -scores on standard political knowledge and interest scales -Trump feeling thermometer from wave 1 -Media feeling thermometer from wave 1 -Trust in the media in wave 1 -Affective polarization in wave 1 (in-party feelings - out-party feelings) -Conspiracy predispositions scale (average response in wave 1) Added covariate for wave 2 belief accuracy outcome models: -lagged average belief accuracy from wave 1 for each type of outcome measure (e.g., average accuracy of pro-Republican fake news in wave 1 for analysis of perceived accuracy of pro-Republican fake news in wave 2; applies to all real/fake/hyperpartisan news types) -We will test for differential attrition between survey waves by examining the relationship between completion of wave 2 and wave 1 treatment assignment. This is our primary measure of attrition. If we observe significant differential attrition based on condition, we will use a strategy such as the one proposed by Aronow et al. to account for missing outcome variables in a randomized experiment (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2305788). We will also test for attrition based on the following observable characteristics: -media trust, media feelings, and average fake news belief in wave 1 -political characteristics (partisanship and political knowledge) -demographic characteristics (race, sex, and age) Due to the large number of characteristics on which we will assess imbalance, we will use a correction for multiple comparisons. Attrition that is unrelated to random assignment should not confound our treatment effect estimates but is worth noting for the reader and potentially addressing in any observational data analyses. -In addition to OLS with robust standard errors and question fixed effects, we will also fit a non-nested hierarchical model with the same covariates. -We will also compute and report descriptive

In this project, we seek to understand how people respond to competing arguments about the same issue. When arguments both for and against a proposition are presented sequentially, do they \u201ccancel out,\u201d leaving people\u2019s post-treatment attitudes at roughly their initial position? Or will people respond asymmetrically to the argument that more closely matches their prior beliefs? In this study, we randomize both the content and the balance of information presented to subjects, allowing us to test these and related hypotheses about persuasive effects in a two-sided context."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "1. Oppositely signed responses: A reasonable guess is that subjects will resolve the con- tradiction between the two arguments by favoring the one that matches their predisposition. Under this theory, people who are pro-immigration will experience a positive treatment effect from the \u201cboth\u201d condition but people who are anti-immigration will experience a negative treatment effect. 2. Canceling effects: It is possible that subjects simply keep something of a running tally of arguments for and against a proposition: if they see one pro and one con argument, they may simply fail to update at all. This is the pattern of results shown in Chong and Druckman (2010), although those authors did not split their sample out by those who are predisposed to one side of the argument or the other. We think this possibility is the most likely. 3.

"value": "This study seeks to understand how and why trust in the media is changing in the U.S. and how levels of media trust expressed in surveys correspond to actual information consumption behavior. To examine these questions, we previously conducted a two-wave public opinion survey on the YouGov Pulse panel that includes independent experimental randomizations in each wave. We are now conducting another one-wave public opinion survey with the YouGov/YouGov Pulse panels that includes an experimental randomization. In addition to collecting public opinion data during each of the two surveys, we are also passively collecting anonymized individual-level web traffic with users' consent, allowing us to measure their real-world behavior. Overall, our hypotheses and analysis will consist of two primary components: -An observational analysis of descriptive patterns of media trust and information consumption in our survey and behavioral data. -Tests of the effect of our experimental treatments on attitudes toward the media (survey outcomes) and information consumption (behavioral outcomes). Note: This is a modified version of the preregistration for our first study (20171122AC)."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Survey evidence of differences in media attitudes To test our hypotheses about news media attitudes, it is first necessary to determine how to best measure them. The following post-treatment survey questions will serve as our dependent variables. Using the thematic groupings below, we will examine whether these questions scale together or not using only data from the control condition (which is not affected by the experimental manipulation). Trust/confidence in media (general and specific organizations): -Confidence in people running the press -Trust in CNN (post-treatment measure only) -Confidence and trust in mass media, network television news, local television news in your community, online-only news outlets, national newspapers, and local newspapers in your community Press accuracy/bias: -Accuracy of news posted online -Major news organizations fabricate -Does the media deal fairly with all sides or favor one side? Support for press freedom: -Criticism of leaders prevents politicians from doing their job (versus keeps them from doing things that shouldn't be done) -Revoke broadcast licenses RQ1: Do measures of media trust and confidence in the press, perceived accuracy or bias, and support for limitations on freedom of the press correspond closely with each other? Based on the results of this analysis, we will construct a composite measures of media attitudes that we will use in the analyses below in addition to specific measures of media trust, perceptions of accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom. The hypotheses of interest below will typically be described as examining \"attitudes toward the media\" or similar terms, which refers to the composite outcome measure we intend to construct as a result of this analysis. We will also separately estimate effects on the three subscales listed above of media trust, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom specifically for each hypothesis. Further details about how these measures will be constructed will be provided in the statistical analysis section below. Attitudes toward the news media vary widely. Over the last several decades, leading Republican and conservative voices have accused the mainstream media of having a liberal bias. The flow of negative claims about the press have escalated since 2016. Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \"fake news\" and accused it of fabrications on the campaign trail and now in the White House. We therefore expect that Republicans, conservatives, and Trump approvers will, on average, express significantly more negative attitudes toward the media than Democrats, liberals, and Trump disapprovers, respectively: H1a: Republicans will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Democrats. Similarly, conservatives will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than either liberals or moderates and Trump approvers will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Trump disapprovers. We also expect that differences in perceptions of media bias and and trust between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and Trump approvers and Trump disapprovers will vary by respondents' levels of political knowledge: H1b: The gap between Republicans and Democrats in attitudes toward the media will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. Similarly, the gap between liberals and conservatives and between Trump approvers and disapprovers will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. (We will also conduct a descriptive analysis of how attitudes toward the media vary over time between our two surveys and when comparing our survey measures of these attitudes to those in other surveys that have used identical question wording. Given that our media attitude measures are measured post-treatment, we will verify that these findings hold using only respondents in our control condition.) Survey data/behavioral data We will conduct descriptive analyses of the extent that self-reports of news consumption relate to actual news consumption and the relationship between media trust and news consumption: RQ2a: To what extent are self-reports of outlet-specific news consumption correlated with actual consumption of news from those outlets? RQ2b: To what extent are attitudes toward the news media correlated with mainstream news consumption? RQ2c: To what extent is outlet-specific trust correlated with consumption of news from those outlets? Experimental effects on beliefs and attitudes measured in surveys We also embed an experiment in our survey that uses random assignment to test whether and how the press reports a story affects attitudes toward the media and views of public figures involved in a controversy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. Specifically, the experiment we have designed examines the controversy over whether Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) knew about sexual abuse of athletes at Ohio State University when we has a wrestling coach there. We experimentally vary whether sources in the article are named or anonymous to see if this affects beliefs and attitudes about the media or Jordan (i.e., do people believe Jordan\u2019s accusers less and/or trust the media less if they are anonymous?). In addition, we contrast a conventionally balanced \u201che said,\u201d \u201cshe said\u201d story with a version in which a potentially false or misleading claim is placed between accurate information. We will again test whether this approach affects beliefs and attitudes toward Jordan and/or the media. We expect to observe heterogeneous effects in response to negative information about a prominent Republican. Relative to the balanced condition with a named source, anonymous or non-balanced coverage of Jordan should have a greater negative effect on attitudes and beliefs about Jordan among Trump disapprovers and Democrats (for whom it is more likely to be attitude-consistent) than among Trump approvers and Republicans, respectively. We conversely expect attitudes toward the media to become more negative among Trump approvers and Republicans when anonymous sources are used or coverage is not balanced than among Trump disapprovers and Democrats. Our hypotheses and research questions about the experiment are the following: H2a: Compared to the control condition, exposure to the named source/balanced condition will reduce the warmth of feelings toward Jordan and increase beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse. H2b: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the anonymous condition will worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides). It will also will have a less negative effect on feelings toward Jordan and beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse than the named source/balanced condition. H2c: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the non-balanced condition will create more negative feelings toward Jordan and increase beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse. RQ3: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, does the non-balanced condition worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides)? (Note: We predict heterogeneous treatment effects on attitudes towards CNN and the press in H3a and H3b and thus pose a research question here for the main effect of the non-balanced condition due to the potential for offsetting treatment effects by party ID or Trump approval.) H3a: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, anonymous and non-balanced conditions will both worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides) among Trump approvers and Republicans. H3b: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, anonymous and non-balanced conditions will worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides) more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats. H3c: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the effect of the anonymous and non-balanced conditions on feelings toward Jordan and beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse will be lower for Trump approvers compared to disapprovers and for Republicans compared to Democrats."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "As discussed above, our hypotheses are tested using data collected from a public opinion survey with an embedded experiment in which we also collect the web traffic data on a person's computer for respondents who are members of the YouGov Pulse panel (Pulse panelists are only a portion of the full sample). We will examine our research questions and hypotheses using responses to survey questions and online behavioral data (where available). The outcome measures will be coded as specified below. We will then conduct the statistical analyses described below. Randomization approach Respondents will be randomized by YouGov with equal probability into one of four conditions: a control condition in which they view an unrelated message or to one of three versions of an article about the controversy over whether Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) knew about sexual abuse of athletes at Ohio State University when he has a wrestling coach there. We specifically compare a conventionally balanced story in which the key source in the article is named with ones in which either the key source is anonymous or in which the article is structured so that a potentially false or misleading claim is placed between accurate information rather than being balanced. Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov/YouGov Pulse panel of US residents age 18 or older, which is recruited and maintained by YouGov. We expect this sample, which will be collected on the YouGov platform, to consist of approximately 2000 participants, including approximately 700 from YouGov Pulse. Respondents are blind to condition. The data, which are anonymized, will include survey data and online behavioral data from respondents willing to install tracking software who are part of the YouGov Pulse panel. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov's traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers multiple weeks of web traffic, with data collected both prior to the survey and after the survey. The software tracks web traffic (minus form entries, passwords, and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration Invitations to participate in the study began to be sent on July 26, 2018. Data collection by YouGov will continue until the number of respondents meets the target sample size. Termination of data collection will be determined by YouGov, not the researchers, and will be blind to outcomes. The researchers will remain blind to the data until data collection is complete and this preregistration is filed. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov or YouGov Pulse panels to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures We describe the coding of survey and behavioral outcome measures below. In some cases, we will combine multiple measures to construct composite outcome measures. In those cases, we will use the procedures described in the statistical analysis section of this preregistration. Coding of raw outcome measures: [Pre-treatment] Please indicate which news sources below that you have heard of, regardless of whether you use them or not. If you are unsure, please DO NOT click it. (randomize order)\u2028 -Fox News -The New York Times -CNN\u2028 Of the news sources you have heard of, please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each one when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly? (grid with sources indicated as known above; randomize order)\u2028 -Great deal of trust [4] -Fair amount of trust [3] -Not very much trust [2] -No trust at all [1] We would like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and institutions who are in the news these days using something we call the feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the person or institution. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the person or institution and that you don't care too much for that person or institution. You would rate them at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward them. If we come to a person or institution whose name you don't recognize, you don't need to rate them.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) [0-100] Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly. If you are not familiar with the source, please select don't know. -The New York Times -The Economist -The Guardian -Fox News -CNN Response options: -Great deal of trust [4] -Fair amount of trust [3] -Not very much trust [2] -No trust at all [1] -Don't know [treated as missing data] Recently, there have been news stories about accusations that Jim Jordan, a Republican member of Congress, knew of sexual misconduct by an Ohio State University doctor. Which of the following statements best describes your view of Jordan\u2019s actions in this matter? -Jordan definitely knew about the misconduct [1] -Jordan probably knew about the conduct [2] -Unclear / I don\u2019t know / I haven\u2019t heard [3] -Jordan probably did not know about the misconduct [4] -Jordan definitely did not know about the misconduct [5] Note: For consistency, all dependent variables are coded such that higher values indicate more positive attitudes toward the media. However, we may reverse the direction of coding for expositional reasons when it is more intuitive for higher values to indicate more negative perceptions (e.g., greater perceptions of bias). Similarly, Jordan-related dependent variables are coded such that higher values indicate more positive views of him. We will assess the dimensionality of the variables measuring attitudes toward the media using factor analysis with these variables. We will first estimate a composite measure of media attitudes using the loadings from the first dimension of a factor analysis estimated on the control group. We will then use those loadings to calculate the composite media attitude score for all respondents. As discussed above, the composite measure includes questions that tap subtle but important differences in dimensions of attitudes towards the media and the press (attitudes about trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom). We will therefore also estimate separate factor scores for each subscale (trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom) using an identical procedure to the main composite measure. (All factor analysis will be estimated using principal-components factor analysis with a varimax rotation.) (We will confirm that the results are similar in MPLUS using the ESEM WLSVM estimator to verify that findings are consistent between data treated as continuous and data treated as categorical.) Behavioral outcome measure coding: We will measure visits to the websites of the outlets listed in the question \"Which of these websites have you visited or used in the past week for news, if any?\" and in \"Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly.\" We will specify this time period in the statistical analysis section below. We will code news and information websites as \"mainstream\" if any of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (see above; based on behavioral data from a previous YouGov Pulse study) and are not affiliated with a particular political party or ideology; -had at least 5 million total unique monthly visits in our 2015 comScore data and ideology slant scores (Bakshy et al. 2015) between -0.55 and 0.55 inclusive and are based in the U.S.; -it is a Wikipedia article; -it is associated with one of the broadcast news networks (ABC, CBS, or NBC); -it is WSJ.com (omitted from our survey question because it is paywalled, but people may choose WSJ articles from a Google search) -it is one of the major fact-checking national organizations (PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet under the criteria above) The list is: abcnews.go.com, aol.com, buzzfeed.com, cbsnews.com, chicagotribune.com, cnbc.com, cnn.com, examiner.com, factcheck.org, fivethirtyeight.com, latimes.com, msn.com, nbcnews.com, nydailynews.com, nypost.com, nytimes.com, politico.com, politifact.com, realclearpolitics.com, snopes.com, theatlantic.com, thedailybeast.com, time.com, usnews.com, washingtonpost.com, wikipedia.org, wsj.com We count news and information websites as \"non-mainstream\" if they are not on the mainstream list above and either of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (which was based on traffic from a previous YouGov Pulse study); -they are classified as focusing on \"hard news\" topics by Bakshy et al. (2015) but fall outside the [-0.55, 0.55] ideological range (out of -2 to 2) The set of qualifying websites in this set includes Breitbart, Daily Kos, Fox News, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and The Blaze. We will consider effects on total webpages visited from mainstream and non-mainstream news and information sources using the criteria described above (we expect that most people will visit at least one website in both categories during the study period and thus exclude a binary measure). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. Statistical analyses All models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors. We will estimate all experimental models in the paper using the control condition as a baseline and present those in the main text or the appendix, but to facilitate reader understanding of difference between the named source/balanced condition and the other two treatment conditions we may report models using the named source/balanced conditio as the baseline and excluding the control condition (results will be identical).

frequently attacks the media, we consider both party ID and Trump approval to be potentially relevant moderators. We therefore plan to estimate results testing for subgroup differences between Trump approvers and disapprovers and between Republicans and Democrats in the appendix. We will test our experimental hypotheses on the outcome variables described above by analyzing the average treatment effect of assignment to treatment relative to the appropriate comparison condition. Where appropriate, we will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. (These may include subgroups defined by party or ideological self-identification, presidential job approval, political knowledge, etc. - see above). We measure political knowledge using an eight-item additive scale of statements where respondents can say \"true\", \"false\" or \"don't know.\" Correct answers will be coded as 1; all others as 0. For any interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. We will also use indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions with continuous measures and replace those in the models below if it does not. (See Hainmueller et al N.d.) In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. Don't know responses will be considered missing data for our outcome measures. If these are sufficiently common, we will consider coding them at the midpoint of the relevant scale. Missing covariates will be treated as missing. In our observational analyses, we will control for the following standard outcome measures: sex (indicator for female), age (indicators for age categories of 30-44, 45-59, and 60+; 18-29 excluded), race (indicator for nonwhite), education (college graduate with a bachelor's degree), and political knowledge (0-8 score). We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample and may also report measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including response timing data and/or accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the stimulus articles. Our primary experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.), though we may also report weighted results. All non-experimental (i.e., observational) analyses will use survey weights. The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit. Regression results for count variables will be verified for robustness using Poisson regression with robust standard errors or negative binomial regression."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "STUDY00030657 (Dartmouth)"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "7/25/18"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "YouGov"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1"}, "attributes": {"etag": "9f8d6b8ad7fc6b643fc31c1d89ddcb58f06cb2bcc2ee647013f96e77da4755af", "kind": "file", "name": "20180801AB_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e385ecd57427b01810c36f1", "size": 115801, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "0a2863e7298781e99e247f66d30066e0", "sha256": "47b689f57e165978a0028050582c0e5de3c22d1512febb26f8810b6b12b4a012"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 115801, "modified": "2020-02-03T17:56:29.876404+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "fqm2h", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20180801AB_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T17:56:29+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "fqm2h", "sha256": "47b689f57e165978a0028050582c0e5de3c22d1512febb26f8810b6b12b4a012", "viewUrl": "/project/tz4mk/files/osfstorage/5e385ed6fa39b7017b1dbe12/", "selectedFileName": "20180801AB_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fqm2h/providers/osfstorage/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9"}, "attributes": {"etag": "0c4cd1ee8b7ec95caa623310e579eda6a80169919ff23499a4aac8cf140a6b65", "kind": "file", "name": "20180801AB_survey.pdf", "path": "/5e385ed157427b01830c3ae9", "size": 408351, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "1c3cf7e226163022c1c29010f4a1809c", "sha256": "f81581bb26b4a214265456283773491467d49bb2121e48cfac123088438f18a3"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 408351, "modified": "2020-02-03T17:56:34.002446+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "fqm2h", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20180801AB_survey.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T17:56:34+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "fqm2h", "sha256": "f81581bb26b4a214265456283773491467d49bb2121e48cfac123088438f18a3", "viewUrl": "/project/tz4mk/files/osfstorage/5e385ed6fa39b7017b1dbe10/", "selectedFileName": "20180801AB_survey.pdf"}], "value": "20180801AB_PAP.pdf, 20180801AB_survey.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Media trust and news consumption: Evidence from survey and behavioral measures (second study)", "q2": "Andrew Guess | Brendan Nyhan | Jason Reifler", "q3": "20180801AB", "q4": "08/01/2018 - 20:58", "q5": "We acknowledge funding/in-kind support from the Poynter Institute, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 682758", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher access to outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "7/26/18", "q12": "2/1/20", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "This study seeks to understand how and why trust in the media is changing in the U.S. and how levels of media trust expressed in surveys correspond to actual information consumption behavior.

Overall, our hypotheses and analysis will consist of two primary components: -An observational analysis of descriptive patterns of media trust and information consumption in our survey and behavioral data. -Tests of the effect of our experimental treatments on attitudes toward the media (survey outcomes) and information consumption (behavioral outcomes). Note: This is a modified version of the preregistration for our first study (20171122AC).", "q16": "Survey evidence of differences in media attitudes To test our hypotheses about news media attitudes, it is first necessary to determine how to best measure them. The following post-treatment survey questions will serve as our dependent variables. Using the thematic groupings below, we will examine whether these questions scale together or not using only data from the control condition (which is not affected by the experimental manipulation). Trust/confidence in media (general and specific organizations): -Confidence in people running the press -Trust in CNN (post-treatment measure only) -Confidence and trust in mass media, network television news, local television news in your community, online-only news outlets, national newspapers, and local newspapers in your community Press accuracy/bias: -Accuracy of news posted online -Major news organizations fabricate -Does the media deal fairly with all sides or favor one side? Support for press freedom: -Criticism of leaders prevents politicians from doing their job (versus keeps them from doing things that shouldn't be done) -Revoke broadcast licenses RQ1: Do measures of media trust and confidence in the press, perceived accuracy or bias, and support for limitations on freedom of the press correspond closely with each other? Based on the results of this analysis, we will construct a composite measures of media attitudes that we will use in the analyses below in addition to specific measures of media trust, perceptions of accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom. The hypotheses of interest below will typically be described as examining \"attitudes toward the media\" or similar terms, which refers to the composite outcome measure we intend to construct as a result of this analysis. We will also separately estimate effects on the three subscales listed above of media trust, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom specifically for each hypothesis. Further details about how these measures will be constructed will be provided in the statistical analysis section below. Attitudes toward the news media vary widely. Over the last several decades, leading Republican and conservative voices have accused the mainstream media of having a liberal bias. The flow of negative claims about the press have escalated since 2016. Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the press as \"fake news\" and accused it of fabrications on the campaign trail and now in the White House. We therefore expect that Republicans, conservatives, and Trump approvers will, on average, express significantly more negative attitudes toward the media than Democrats, liberals, and Trump disapprovers, respectively: H1a: Republicans will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Democrats. Similarly, conservatives will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than either liberals or moderates and Trump approvers will have more negative attitudes toward the news media than Trump disapprovers. We also expect that differences in perceptions of media bias and and trust between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and Trump approvers and Trump disapprovers will vary by respondents' levels of political knowledge: H1b: The gap between Republicans and Democrats in attitudes toward the media will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. Similarly, the gap between liberals and conservatives and between Trump approvers and disapprovers will be greater among respondents with higher political knowledge than those with less knowledge. (We will also conduct a descriptive analysis of how attitudes toward the media vary over time between our two surveys and when comparing our survey measures of these attitudes to those in other surveys that have used identical question wording. Given that our media attitude measures are measured post-treatment, we will verify that these findings hold using only respondents in our control condition.) Survey data/behavioral data We will conduct descriptive analyses of the extent that self-reports of news consumption relate to actual news consumption and the relationship between media trust and news consumption: RQ2a: To what extent are self-reports of outlet-specific news consumption correlated with actual consumption of news from those outlets? RQ2b: To what extent are attitudes toward the news media correlated with mainstream news consumption? RQ2c: To what extent is outlet-specific trust correlated with consumption of news from those outlets? Experimental effects on beliefs and attitudes measured in surveys We also embed an experiment in our survey that uses random assignment to test whether and how the press reports a story affects attitudes toward the media and views of public figures involved in a controversy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. Specifically, the experiment we have designed examines the controversy over whether Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) knew about sexual abuse of athletes at Ohio State University when we has a wrestling coach there. We experimentally vary whether sources in the article are named or anonymous to see if this affects beliefs and attitudes about the media or Jordan (i.e., do people believe Jordan\u2019s accusers less and/or trust the media less if they are anonymous?). In addition, we contrast a conventionally balanced \u201che said,\u201d \u201cshe said\u201d story with a version in which a potentially false or misleading claim is placed between accurate information. We will again test whether this approach affects beliefs and attitudes toward Jordan and/or the media. We expect to observe heterogeneous effects in response to negative information about a prominent Republican. Relative to the balanced condition with a named source, anonymous or non-balanced coverage of Jordan should have a greater negative effect on attitudes and beliefs about Jordan among Trump disapprovers and Democrats (for whom it is more likely to be attitude-consistent) than among Trump approvers and Republicans, respectively. We conversely expect attitudes toward the media to become more negative among Trump approvers and Republicans when anonymous sources are used or coverage is not balanced than among Trump disapprovers and Democrats. Our hypotheses and research questions about the experiment are the following: H2a: Compared to the control condition, exposure to the named source/balanced condition will reduce the warmth of feelings toward Jordan and increase beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse. H2b: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the anonymous condition will worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides). It will also will have a less negative effect on feelings toward Jordan and beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse than the named source/balanced condition. H2c: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the non-balanced condition will create more negative feelings toward Jordan and increase beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse. RQ3: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, does the non-balanced condition worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides)? (Note: We predict heterogeneous treatment effects on attitudes towards CNN and the press in H3a and H3b and thus pose a research question here for the main effect of the non-balanced condition due to the potential for offsetting treatment effects by party ID or Trump approval.) H3a: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, anonymous and non-balanced conditions will both worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides) among Trump approvers and Republicans. H3b: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, anonymous and non-balanced conditions will worsen attitudes toward CNN and the press (including worsening beliefs that the media fabricates information and does not deal fairly with all sides) more among Trump approvers than disapprovers and more among Republicans than Democrats. H3c: Compared to the named source/balanced condition, the effect of the anonymous and non-balanced conditions on feelings toward Jordan and beliefs that he knew about alleged abuse will be lower for Trump approvers compared to disapprovers and for Republicans compared to Democrats.", "q17": "As discussed above, our hypotheses are tested using data collected from a public opinion survey with an embedded experiment in which we also collect the web traffic data on a person's computer for respondents who are members of the YouGov Pulse panel (Pulse panelists are only a portion of the full sample). We will examine our research questions and hypotheses using responses to survey questions and online behavioral data (where available). The outcome measures will be coded as specified below. We will then conduct the statistical analyses described below. Randomization approach Respondents will be randomized by YouGov with equal probability into one of four conditions: a control condition in which they view an unrelated message or to one of three versions of an article about the controversy over whether Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) knew about sexual abuse of athletes at Ohio State University when he has a wrestling coach there. We specifically compare a conventionally balanced story in which the key source in the article is named with ones in which either the key source is anonymous or in which the article is structured so that a potentially false or misleading claim is placed between accurate information rather than being balanced. Respondents, data collection and blinding We are conducting this study using a YouGov/YouGov Pulse panel of US residents age 18 or older, which is recruited and maintained by YouGov. We expect this sample, which will be collected on the YouGov platform, to consist of approximately 2000 participants, including approximately 700 from YouGov Pulse. Respondents are blind to condition. The data, which are anonymized, will include survey data and online behavioral data from respondents willing to install tracking software who are part of the YouGov Pulse panel. The online tracking panel is currently branded as YouGov Pulse. Panelists are recruited from YouGov's traditional participant pool via incentives. The data to be used for this study covers multiple weeks of web traffic, with data collected both prior to the survey and after the survey. The software tracks web traffic (minus form entries, passwords, and financial transactions) for all browsers installed on a user's computer and can be uninstalled at any time. Users provide full consent to download and install the software and identifying information is not collected. Interventions and dates of administration Invitations to participate in the study began to be sent on July 26, 2018. Data collection by YouGov will continue until the number of respondents meets the target sample size. Termination of data collection will be determined by YouGov, not the researchers, and will be blind to outcomes. The researchers will remain blind to the data until data collection is complete and this preregistration is filed. Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants All U.S. residents age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Participants must be members of the YouGov or YouGov Pulse panels to be selected for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures We describe the coding of survey and behavioral outcome measures below. In some cases, we will combine multiple measures to construct composite outcome measures. In those cases, we will use the procedures described in the statistical analysis section of this preregistration.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) [0-100] Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly. If you are not familiar with the source, please select don't know. -The New York Times -The Economist -The Guardian -Fox News -CNN Response options: -Great deal of trust [4] -Fair amount of trust [3] -Not very much trust [2] -No trust at all [1] -Don't know [treated as missing data] Recently, there have been news stories about accusations that Jim Jordan, a Republican member of Congress, knew of sexual misconduct by an Ohio State University doctor. Which of the following statements best describes your view of Jordan\u2019s actions in this matter? -Jordan definitely knew about the misconduct [1] -Jordan probably knew about the conduct [2] -Unclear / I don\u2019t know / I haven\u2019t heard [3] -Jordan probably did not know about the misconduct [4] -Jordan definitely did not know about the misconduct [5] Note: For consistency, all dependent variables are coded such that higher values indicate more positive attitudes toward the media. However, we may reverse the direction of coding for expositional reasons when it is more intuitive for higher values to indicate more negative perceptions (e.g., greater perceptions of bias). Similarly, Jordan-related dependent variables are coded such that higher values indicate more positive views of him. We will assess the dimensionality of the variables measuring attitudes toward the media using factor analysis with these variables. We will first estimate a composite measure of media attitudes using the loadings from the first dimension of a factor analysis estimated on the control group. We will then use those loadings to calculate the composite media attitude score for all respondents. As discussed above, the composite measure includes questions that tap subtle but important differences in dimensions of attitudes towards the media and the press (attitudes about trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom). We will therefore also estimate separate factor scores for each subscale (trust/confidence in media, perceptions of press accuracy/bias, and support for press freedom) using an identical procedure to the main composite measure. (All factor analysis will be estimated using principal-components factor analysis with a varimax rotation.) (We will confirm that the results are similar in MPLUS using the ESEM WLSVM estimator to verify that findings are consistent between data treated as continuous and data treated as categorical.) Behavioral outcome measure coding: We will measure visits to the websites of the outlets listed in the question \"Which of these websites have you visited or used in the past week for news, if any?\" and in \"Please indicate how much trust and confidence you have in each news source listed below when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly.\" We will specify this time period in the statistical analysis section below. We will code news and information websites as \"mainstream\" if any of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (see above; based on behavioral data from a previous YouGov Pulse study) and are not affiliated with a particular political party or ideology; -had at least 5 million total unique monthly visits in our 2015 comScore data and ideology slant scores (Bakshy et al. 2015) between -0.55 and 0.55 inclusive and are based in the U.S.; -it is a Wikipedia article; -it is associated with one of the broadcast news networks (ABC, CBS, or NBC); -it is WSJ.com (omitted from our survey question because it is paywalled, but people may choose WSJ articles from a Google search) -it is one of the major fact-checking national organizations (PolitiFact, Snopes, or Factcheck.org; the Washington Post Fact Checker is excluded because it is part of the Washington Post, which is already a qualifying media outlet under the criteria above) The list is: abcnews.go.com, aol.com, buzzfeed.com, cbsnews.com, chicagotribune.com, cnbc.com, cnn.com, examiner.com, factcheck.org, fivethirtyeight.com, latimes.com, msn.com, nbcnews.com, nydailynews.com, nypost.com, nytimes.com, politico.com, politifact.com, realclearpolitics.com, snopes.com, theatlantic.com, thedailybeast.com, time.com, usnews.com, washingtonpost.com, wikipedia.org, wsj.com We count news and information websites as \"non-mainstream\" if they are not on the mainstream list above and either of the following is true: -they are on the list of websites visited for news in our media exposure survey question (which was based on traffic from a previous YouGov Pulse study); -they are classified as focusing on \"hard news\" topics by Bakshy et al. (2015) but fall outside the [-0.55, 0.55] ideological range (out of -2 to 2) The set of qualifying websites in this set includes Breitbart, Daily Kos, Fox News, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and The Blaze. We will consider effects on total webpages visited from mainstream and non-mainstream news and information sources using the criteria described above (we expect that most people will visit at least one website in both categories during the study period and thus exclude a binary measure). Duplicate visits to webpages will not be counted if they are successive (i.e., a page that was reloaded after first opening it). URLs are cleaned of referrer information and other parameters before de-duplication. Statistical analyses All models will be estimated using ordinary least squares with robust standard errors. We will estimate all experimental models in the paper using the control condition as a baseline and present those in the main text or the appendix, but to facilitate reader understanding of difference between the named source/balanced condition and the other two treatment conditions we may report models using the named source/balanced conditio as the baseline and excluding the control condition (results will be identical).

frequently attacks the media, we consider both party ID and Trump approval to be potentially relevant moderators. We therefore plan to estimate results testing for subgroup differences between Trump approvers and disapprovers and between Republicans and Democrats in the appendix. We will test our experimental hypotheses on the outcome variables described above by analyzing the average treatment effect of assignment to treatment relative to the appropriate comparison condition. Where appropriate, we will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities from our models, including treatment effects by subgroup and differences in marginal effects between subgroups. (These may include subgroups defined by party or ideological self-identification, presidential job approval, political knowledge, etc. - see above). We measure political knowledge using an eight-item additive scale of statements where respondents can say \"true\", \"false\" or \"don't know.\" Correct answers will be coded as 1; all others as 0. For any interaction terms, scales, and moderators, if results are consistent using a median/tercile split or indicators rather than a continuous scale, we may present the latter in the main text for ease of exposition and include the continuous scale results in an appendix. We will compute all marginal effects appropriate to test the hypotheses of interest from any interaction models described below. We will also use indicators to test whether the linearity assumption holds for interactions with continuous measures and replace those in the models below if it does not. (See Hainmueller et al N.d.) In some cases, we may present treatment effects estimated on different subsets of the data for expositional clarity. If so, we will verify that we can reject the null of no difference in treatment effects in a more complex interactive model reported in an appendix when possible. Don't know responses will be considered missing data for our outcome measures. If these are sufficiently common, we will consider coding them at the midpoint of the relevant scale. Missing covariates will be treated as missing. In our observational analyses, we will control for the following standard outcome measures: sex (indicator for female), age (indicators for age categories of 30-44, 45-59, and 60+; 18-29 excluded), race (indicator for nonwhite), education (college graduate with a bachelor's degree), and political knowledge (0-8 score). We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample and may also report measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including response timing data and/or accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the stimulus articles. Our primary experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.), though we may also report weighted results. All non-experimental (i.e., observational) analyses will use survey weights. The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. Where applicable, regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit. Regression results for count variables will be verified for robustness using Poisson regression with robust standard errors or negative binomial regression.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19":
