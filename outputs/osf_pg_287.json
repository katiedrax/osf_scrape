It is the subject\u2019s attachment to their mother and/or father and whether they like or do not like a person when they see a picture of a stranger smiling or making a neutral face. \nParticipants\nThis study will randomly select 100 students who are legal adults, 18 and older. Participants will be recruited on Southern Methodist University\u2019s campus. They will be approached by one of the five researchers on campus, whether the participant is walking to class or eating in the dining halls. Data will only be discarded when participants are under 18 because this study focuses on adults, not minors. As a note, this study will be collecting fewer than 180 subjects. Because of this small sample size, it is a limitation to generalize and apply this study to our subjects of interest. \nMeasures\n\tThe variables observed will be age through numeric free responses and gender through a nominal scale. To collect demographic information, another variable will use a free response to answer the state and country they spent most of their childhood. After collecting general information, other variables observed are the subject\u2019s relationship to each of their parents on an 5-item ordinal scale from strong to distant relationship. Subjects with only one parent and students without parents will be included to observe if there is no attachment from a parent can correlate with one\u2019s responses to seeing a smiling or neutral face. \nProcedure\nThis study will begin by obtaining two photos of a stranger; one photo with the stranger making a neutral face and the other with the same stranger smiling. Researchers in this group will randomly approach each participant on SMU\u2019s campus. The researcher will ask the participant the same question: Would you mind taking a quick survey because it will only take 5 minutes? There will be no discussion about the premises of the study until the participant completes the survey. If the participant says yes, the researcher will use a random number generator on their devices prior to distributing the survey to determine whether the participant will see the neutral face or smiling face from the stranger\u2019s picture. Using a nominal scale, a randomly selected even number = smiling face and odd number = tails. Once the participant has been assigned to the treatment of either seeing the smiling face or neutral face. Before completing these questions, the participant will see one of the facial reactions from the stranger\u2019s picture. After seeing one of the stranger\u2019s smiling or neutral face, the participant will then ask if they like the stranger or not. These questions will ask their name, age, gender, state and country they grew up, their attachment to their mother and/or father. \nAnalyses and Expected Results\nThis study\u2019s results hope to find a correlation between an adult\u2019s liking to a stranger when they are presented either a smiling face or neutral face and its correlation to their attachment to their mother and/or father. In this study, it is expected to see a strong, positive correlation between a strong parental attachment and liking to a stranger\u2019s photo and a weaker correlation between a weak or no parental attachment and liking to a stranger\u2019s photo. \nHypotheses\nIf the participant has a moderately strong attachment with their mother and/or father, then it can correlate with their likeability when seeing a neutral or smiling face. If the participant has a strong attachment to their mother and/or father and sees a smiling or neutral face, they will like the stranger in the photo.

In this study, it is expected to see a strong, positive correlation between a strong parental attachment and liking to a stranger\u2019s photo and a weaker correlation between a weak or no parental attachment and liking to a stranger\u2019s photo. \nHypotheses\nIf the participant has a moderately strong attachment with their mother and/or father, then it can correlate with their likeability when seeing a neutral or smiling face. If the participant has a strong attachment to their mother and/or father and sees a smiling or neutral face, they will like the stranger in the photo. If the participant has a moderate,weak, or no relationship with their mother and/or father and sees a neutral face, they will not like the stranger in the photo.", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=hyq94", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "hyq94", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "hyq94", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/etq9h/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "etq9h", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pvfbj/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "pvfbj", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/hyq94/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/hyq94/"}}, {"id": "7naj5", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Prevalence of signs and symptoms of bruxism in children: A systematic review", "description": "Sleep bruxism signs and symptoms differ according to the patient and could include abnormal tooth wear, tongue indentations, line alba along the biting plane, hypertrophy of masseter muscles, grinding of teeth accompanied by a characteristic sound, pain in the masticatory and/or cervical muscles, pain in temporomandibular joint and headache.
