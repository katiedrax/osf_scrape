While state audit institutions are advocated as a solution to waste and corruption, especially in developing countries (Dye and Stapenhurst 1998), they have a mixed record of success. Traditional audits may fail to elicit greater bureaucratic effort (e.g., Litschig and Zamboni 2015) or may displace corruption as officials shift spending away from audited expenses (e.g., Olken 2007). Even where successful, they rely on the strength and autonomy of institutions like the media and judiciary (e.g., Ferraz and Finan 2008), which are often weak in many lower and middle income countries (Helmke and Rios-Figueroa 2011). Other interventions to improve bureaucratic performance employ financial and material incentives (e.g., Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan 2012), but these interventions rarely engage with existing oversight institutions and typically require an ongoing commitment of funds. We hypothesize that voluntary audits might be an effective tool for eliciting effort. Voluntary audits give street-level bureaucrats a choice and opportunity for self-direction, which existing scholarship suggests can increase intrinsic motivation (Ryan and Deci 2000). Separately, voluntary audits could provide bureaucrats with professional and social recognition, which scholars suggest matters for their performance (Pepinsky, Pierskalla, and Sacks 2017; Wilson 1989). If the opportunity to volunteer for an audit increases either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation, then we expect bureaucratic effort to increase and, potentially, outcomes to improve, as well. Our project aims to contribute to the small but growing literature that explores the role of non-financial incentives on pro-social activities and bureaucratic performance and recruitment (Ashraf, Bandiera, and Jack, 2014; Banuri and Keefer 2016; Dal B\u00f3, Finan, and Rossi 2013). We partner with the Provincial Auditing Office (PAO) in Chaco, Argentina, to test whether a new system of voluntary audits improves the performance of school principals in their administration of a free meal program. Our field experiment intervenes in the oversight of a school meal program, in which principals are responsible for school-level implementation (including menu planning and overseeing food preparation). We randomly assign principals to receive an invitation to a voluntary audit or to be part of the control group, which is exposed to the status quo situation, where schools face a small (but non-zero) likelihood of a mandatory audit."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We expect that principals in the treatment group will exert more effort in the implementation of the school meal program compared to the control group. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will measure the following outcomes collected directly from the endline survey of school principals: total number of hours worked, number of \u201cextra\u201d hours worked, and number of hours school principals report devoting to the meal program. We will also check whether any increase in hours comes at expense of time spent in other activities, as well as an index of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and the extent to which principals consider the opinion of the provincial auditing office to be important to them. If the intervention changes school principals\u2019 behavior and/or motivation, we expect the school meal program to improve. Our school-level outcomes include student attendance, which interviews with local experts suggest is linked to the number and quality of meals served, the proportion of days schools offer snack/lunch in a given reporting period, basic composition of the meals (for example, number of unique menus in a given reporting period, and number of meals that contain fresh fruits or vegetables), and number of days a school is closed, because unanticipated school closings may reflect lower principal effort to provide meals. Finally, we will explore if treatment interacts with baseline characteristics, including how embedded a school principal is in the school\u2019s community, parental engagement in the school, and socio-economic composition of the school community. The study will allow us to describe the profile of school principals who accept a voluntary audit, and draw causal inferences on whether (1) voluntary audits generate a direct effect on school principals who receive an invitation to participate in a voluntary audit and, (2) whether the voluntary system generates spillover effects. Our sample includes 188 schools in 13 regions in the province of Chaco. To account for potential spillovers, we employ a two-level randomization. First, we assign the 13 regions to either a high density or low density treatment group.

The general public frequently misinterprets data in journal articles, presentations, and the mass media, and especially struggles with uncertainty about estimated quantities. For example, even a highly educated figure like Chief Justice John Roberts recently referred to his difficulty understanding \u201csocial science gobbledygook\u201d. Scholars and others seeking to communicate uncertainty about data usually turn to visual representations of margin of errors and data variability, since the general public has little understanding of statistical terminology.

(2017), Esteves (2005) elaborated a model of e-services grouped into five dimensions. This model has been adapted to study municipalities in Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela (see Bayona and Morales, 2017; G\u00f3mez, 2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al., 2019). Moreover, the literature identifies a series of factors which determine the success of local e-government, among which are elements related with availability of technology infrastructure (see Alcaide-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2014; Lowatcharin and Menifield,2015), political factors, organisational factors or local administrative capacity (see Andrews and Entwistle, 2015; Andrews et al., 2013; Manoharan, 2013; Norris and Moon, 2005), and population characteristics. Esteves\u2019 e-services model (2005; see also Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al., 2019) contains 15 items grouped into five dimensions to evaluate government Web portals (see Fath-Allah et al., 2017). Salazar et al. (2010) used this model for the Los R\u00edos Region of Chile, while Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al.

This research applies the model for the 345 municipalities in all the regions in Chile.

Firstly, I calculate, describe, and georeference the E-Government Index (EGi). Secondly, I calculate spatial autocorrelation indicators. Finally, I analyse the predictors associated with a high index using spatial econometric models. I use the Moran index (Moran-I), analogous to the Pearson coefficient for spatial units (Goodchild, 2008), in two variants: under the assumption of randomisation and with a Monte Carlo simulation. On one hand, Moran-I under randomisation involves a random permutation of spatial units to obtain spatial autocorrelation and statistical significance values (Celem\u00edn, 2009). On the other hand, The Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC) enables me to know random variables of a sample based on their probability distribution (Jackman, 2004). I carry out 10,000 simulations for each analysis. These Bayesian simulations allow learn about the posterior density by sampling iteration (Jackman, 2004). Specifically, I use the Gibbs sampler, a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Trumbo and Suess, 2014). I have programmed a code in R to elaborate spatial contiguity neighbours\u2019 matrixes with vector data from Territorial Information System of the National Congress Library of Chile (SIIT-BCN in Spanish) in order to calculate Moran-I under randomisation and with MCMC. I work with matrixes of all regions based on the Sphere of Influence (SOI) model, a matrix derived from the Delaunay triangulation of neighbours, where the relation between points is based on Euclidean distance. In the SOI matrixes, triangulation is reduced by removing links that are relatively distant (Bivand et al., 2013).

Fath-Allah et al. (2017; see also Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al., 2019) evaluate 25 recent models found in the academic literature. In line with the stages identified by Fath-Allah et al. (2017), Esteves (2005) elaborated a model of e-services grouped into five dimensions. This model has been adapted to study municipalities in Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela (see Bayona and Morales, 2017; G\u00f3mez, 2007; Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al., 2019). Moreover, the literature identifies a series of factors which determine the success of local e-government, among which are elements related with availability of technology infrastructure (see Alcaide-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2014; Lowatcharin and Menifield,2015), political factors, organisational factors or local administrative capacity (see Andrews and Entwistle, 2015; Andrews et al., 2013; Manoharan, 2013; Norris and Moon, 2005), and population characteristics. Esteves\u2019 e-services model (2005; see also Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al., 2019) contains 15 items grouped into five dimensions to evaluate government Web portals (see Fath-Allah et al., 2017). Salazar et al. (2010) used this model for the Los R\u00edos Region of Chile, while Gonz\u00e1lez-Bustamante et al. (2019) carried out a measurement in 2016 in the five most populated regions in Chile: (i) Metropolitan (40.67% of the national population); (ii) B\u00edo B\u00edo (11.70%); (iii) Valpara\u00edso (10.13%); (iv) La Araucan\u00eda (5,48%); and (v) Coquimbo (4,30%). This research applies the model for the 345 municipalities in all the regions in Chile.

Firstly, I calculate, describe, and georeference the E-Government Index (EGi). Secondly, I calculate spatial autocorrelation indicators. Finally, I analyse the predictors associated with a high index using spatial econometric models. I use the Moran index (Moran-I), analogous to the Pearson coefficient for spatial units (Goodchild, 2008), in two variants: under the assumption of randomisation and with a Monte Carlo simulation. On one hand, Moran-I under randomisation involves a random permutation of spatial units to obtain spatial autocorrelation and statistical significance values (Celem\u00edn, 2009). On the other hand, The Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC) enables me to know random variables of a sample based on their probability distribution (Jackman, 2004). I carry out 10,000 simulations for each analysis. These Bayesian simulations allow learn about the posterior density by sampling iteration (Jackman, 2004). Specifically, I use the Gibbs sampler, a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Trumbo and Suess, 2014). I have programmed a code in R to elaborate spatial contiguity neighbours\u2019 matrixes with vector data from Territorial Information System of the National Congress Library of Chile (SIIT-BCN in Spanish) in order to calculate Moran-I under randomisation and with MCMC. I work with matrixes of all regions based on the Sphere of Influence (SOI) model, a matrix derived from the Delaunay triangulation of neighbours, where the relation between points is based on Euclidean distance. In the SOI matrixes, triangulation is reduced by removing links that are relatively distant (Bivand et al., 2013). First, I fit three Ordinary Least Squares models (OLS), each one with different control variables. These models allow evaluate the spatial autocorrelation in the residuals with Moran-I. If the test is statistically significant at 95%, the residuals are spatially clustered, hence it is necessary to fit spatial econometric models.

Outside of offices with gender quotas, women's candidacy and election into office still lags far behind that of men's-especially in countries that hold highly patriarchal views. In India, for instance, women make up over 33 percent to 50 percent of village-level offices, or gram panchayats, due to gender quotas. Yet, the proportion of female candidates running for higher-levels of federal offices have merely increased from 2.7 percent in 1962 to 7.4 percent in 2014 (Jensenius 2018). In 2014, women only made up 11 percent of the elected Lower House of Parliament or Lok Sabha members (ibid). Though the data suggests that women get elected at higher levels than men upon running for office, Jensenius (2018) finds that the credit ought to go to parties, not voters, who field women in uncompetitive constituencies to win 'soft' seats. Despite these trends, India has had several prominent national- and state-level female leaders, including Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but the electoral field has largely remained male-dominated. This slow pace of growth in India is puzzling alongside two trends in electoral politics. One, the advent of gender quotas in the 1990s have improved perceptions of women as leaders, at least at the local level (Beaman et al. 2009). We would therefore expect improved perceptions of women to coincide with a greater likelihood of women running for and winning political office. Two, the National Election Studies found that the gender gap in voting has all but closed as approximately 66 percent of both men and women participated in elections in 2014. If women's perceptions as leaders are improving and women are increasingly becoming a key part of the electoral process, why are we failing to see more women in politics? To answer the question, I specifically examine how women's role in society impact voters' perception of them as candidates. Specifically, I use a survey experiment to examine whether the prototype of the Indian woman as a housewife, mother, and daughter constricts how voters perceive women who run. I do so by varying two variables: (1) a fictitious female candidate's marital status (married, unmarried, widowed) and (2) whether or not they are a dynastic politician."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "To examine the question, I will implement an online survey experiment on Qualtrics, which will be advertised on Facebook in India to recruit respondents. The survey experiment will manipulate two categories in a fictitious profile of a female candidate running for office: her marital status and her family background. Marital status categories will be unmarried, married, or widowed. Family background categories will be that her family has a background in politics and her family has no background in politics. Together, these two fields are eliciting implicit assumptions respondents make about a candidate profile, and then explicitly informing them about dynastic politics involvement to gauge whether feelings about the candidate change. The hypotheses are listed below: Main effects: H1: Widowed women are viewed as more competent than married and unmarried women, keeping age constant. H2: Voters will state a preference for voting in favor of widowed women over married women and married women over unmarried women, holding age constant. H3: H1-H2 will not change, even if voters state no explicit gender bias in their own attitudes. H4: Explicitly informing voters that a woman\u2019s family background is not in politics will reduce their perception of her competence, but increase their preference for voting for her. Heterogenous effects: I will conduct a subgroup analysis for heterogenous effects for the following variables, but I do not expect to see differences across the groups as I believe the treatment illicits a subconscious response: gender of the respondent, BJP supporter versus non-BJP supporter, and education level (12th grade and below or higher education)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "I will conduct the survey experiment on Qualtrics, for which respondents will be recruited through a Facebook ad to win a smartphone through a drawing.

Using a sample size of approximately 1800 (200 per treatment arm), I will recruit individuals from across the country, with targeted ads in smaller, tier-1 cities, and amongst women to ensure gender balance in the respondents. Given that the survey is online and in English, I do not claim any representativeness of the survey. Instead, it merely seeks to disentangle the effect of marital status on voters' perceptions and the underlying mechanisms.

far exceeded the reality. Outside of offices with gender quotas, women's candidacy and election into office still lags far behind that of men's-especially in countries that hold highly patriarchal views. In India, for instance, women make up over 33 percent to 50 percent of village-level offices, or gram panchayats, due to gender quotas. Yet, the proportion of female candidates running for higher-levels of federal offices have merely increased from 2.7 percent in 1962 to 7.4 percent in 2014 (Jensenius 2018). In 2014, women only made up 11 percent of the elected Lower House of Parliament or Lok Sabha members (ibid). Though the data suggests that women get elected at higher levels than men upon running for office, Jensenius (2018) finds that the credit ought to go to parties, not voters, who field women in uncompetitive constituencies to win 'soft' seats. Despite these trends, India has had several prominent national- and state-level female leaders, including Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but the electoral field has largely remained male-dominated. This slow pace of growth in India is puzzling alongside two trends in electoral politics. One, the advent of gender quotas in the 1990s have improved perceptions of women as leaders, at least at the local level (Beaman et al. 2009). We would therefore expect improved perceptions of women to coincide with a greater likelihood of women running for and winning political office. Two, the National Election Studies found that the gender gap in voting has all but closed as approximately 66 percent of both men and women participated in elections in 2014. If women's perceptions as leaders are improving and women are increasingly becoming a key part of the electoral process, why are we failing to see more women in politics? To answer the question, I specifically examine how women's role in society impact voters' perception of them as candidates. Specifically, I use a survey experiment to examine whether the prototype of the Indian woman as a housewife, mother, and daughter constricts how voters perceive women who run. I do so by varying two variables: (1) a fictitious female candidate's marital status (married, unmarried, widowed) and (2) whether or not they are a dynastic politician.", "q16": "To examine the question, I will implement an online survey experiment on Qualtrics, which will be advertised on Facebook in India to recruit respondents. The survey experiment will manipulate two categories in a fictitious profile of a female candidate running for office: her marital status and her family background. Marital status categories will be unmarried, married, or widowed. Family background categories will be that her family has a background in politics and her family has no background in politics. Together, these two fields are eliciting implicit assumptions respondents make about a candidate profile, and then explicitly informing them about dynastic politics involvement to gauge whether feelings about the candidate change. The hypotheses are listed below: Main effects: H1: Widowed women are viewed as more competent than married and unmarried women, keeping age constant. H2: Voters will state a preference for voting in favor of widowed women over married women and married women over unmarried women, holding age constant. H3: H1-H2 will not change, even if voters state no explicit gender bias in their own attitudes. H4: Explicitly informing voters that a woman\u2019s family background is not in politics will reduce their perception of her competence, but increase their preference for voting for her. Heterogenous effects: I will conduct a subgroup analysis for heterogenous effects for the following variables, but I do not expect to see differences across the groups as I believe the treatment illicits a subconscious response: gender of the respondent, BJP supporter versus non-BJP supporter, and education level (12th grade and below or higher education).", "q17": "I will conduct the survey experiment on Qualtrics, for which respondents will be recruited through a Facebook ad to win a smartphone through a drawing. I opt for Facebook given that this sample will be more targeted than one recruited by Mechanical Turk in India. Using a sample size of approximately 1800 (200 per treatment arm), I will recruit individuals from across the country, with targeted ads in smaller, tier-1 cities, and amongst women to ensure gender balance in the respondents. Given that the survey is online and in English, I do not claim any representativeness of the survey. Instead, it merely seeks to disentangle the effect of marital status on voters' perceptions and the underlying mechanisms. If the method described above on Facebook yields low response rates, I will use mTurk to collect the data.", "q18": "India", "q19": "1800", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Other (describe in text box

constitute only a small minority of elected officials. In this project, this underrepresentation of women in politics serves as the main starting point. More in particular, the role of political gender stereotypes as a source of voter bias is explored. Previous research on political gender stereotypes was mostly set in the context of the United States, where female representatives are rather scarce and concentrated within the Democratic Party. Generally, women were considered as competent in communal areas, such as education and health care, whereas male candidates excel in all other issue domains. Women are also perceived as more leftist than men. However, we cannot simply extrapolate the results of these American studies to other political systems, since the US has a distinct political culture and context. The European context, and List PR-systems in particular, has not been investigated in these matters. In this project, the focus is on Flanders (Belgium). The combination of a highly proportional List-PR system and a stringent quota system results in higher shares of elected women (one of the highest in the world), a very fragmented party system with female politicians relatively equally spread over the different parties, and less focus on individual candidates. These consequences of using a List-PR provide a political context that is more woman-friendly compared to majoritarian systems. Hence, this presents an interesting case to conduct research on the prevalence of political gender stereotypes."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Our aim is to find out whether gender stereotypes are present in the Flemish political sphere. Our expectation is that general gender stereotypes will be reflected in politics in two ways: perceptions that female and male politicians have different issue competences and hold different ideological positions. Regarding the different areas of issue expertise, we expect that women, because they are typically seen as communal and social, will be stereotyped as having more competence in communal issues. Conversely, we expect that women will be perceived as being less competent in agentic issues. For neutral issues, we do not expect differences. This leads us to the following hypotheses: H1a: The perceived general competences of women candidates on agentic issues will be lower than that of men candidates. H1b: The perceived general competences of women candidates on neutral issues will be similar than that of men candidates. H1c: The perceived general competences of women candidates on communal issues will be higher than that of men candidates. Another component of political gender stereotypes is the different perception of the social attitudes and political beliefs of women (Diekman et al., 2002). Although women are more equally spread over the different parties in Flanders, we believe that also there female candidates will be perceived as being more leftist, since they are also seen as possessing communal traits, as more competent to handle communal issues and to write more legislation on women\u2019s issues (Welch & Thomas, 1991). H2: The perceived ideological position of women candidates will be more to the left than that of men candidates. Also list position cues are very important in the Flemish List-PR system. Following interaction theory (Peffley, Hurwitz, & Sniderman, 1997), both gender and list position cues potentially work in tandem to help voters to form coherent impressions (Kundra & Sinclair, 1999). We therefore also want to investigate whether women benefit from a head of list position. From a gender perspective, one could argue that a female candidate may benefit from a head of list position, because the information attached to this high list position (i.e. candidates listed first are highly competent) is deviant from the general impression of female candidates. Moreover, despite stringent quota regulations, the number of female head of list candidates is below that of male head of list candidates. Therefore, voters might have the impression that those female candidates who succeed in obtaining a top list position have to be extremely qualified. H3a: The perceived general competence of female head of list candidates will be higher than that of male head of list candidates. On the other hand, it is plausible to argue that female candidates with a middle of list position will be worse off. Quota regulations are often criticized for leading to the selection of unqualified candidates just to meet the quota standards (see for example J\u00falio & Tavares, 2017; Wauters, Maddens, & Put, 2014; Weeks & Baldez, 2015), which possibly result in lower levels of perceived competence for female middle of list candidates. H3b: The perceived general competence of female middle of list candidates will be lower than that of male middle of list candidates."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "These hypotheses will be tested on the basis of an experimental research design in which hypothetical candidates were presented to respondents in text messages in which only their sex, their position on the list and their policy position on a particular issue were mentioned. We did not mention the party affiliation of the presented candidates and the policy statements all took a centrist position, in order not to influence the assessment of the ideological position of the presented candidates. Our study used a 2x3x6 mixed complete block design. The candidate\u2019s sex (male versus female) and the list position (head of list, position in the middle or no list position mentioned) were manipulated as between-group factors. Six different policy issues were manipulated as within-groups factor. We included two topics that are generally perceived as being communal (health care and education), two agentic topics (defence and finance) and two gender-neutral topics (tourism and climate). This categorization is based on an extensive review of 16 international studies on the assignment of policy issues to men and women by three key actors, i.e. (mass) media, voters and party elites . We also checked whether these findings hold in our Flemish context by exploring literature on portfolio allocations and by looking at the appointment of male and female ministers to these issue domains. Respondents were randomly assigned to six different treatments. After each text message, respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about the presented candidate and message, before continuing to the next profile. The order of the issue domains was randomized in order to control for order effects. There was also a random variation of male and female candidates, and of head of list and middle of list candidates. The hypothetical candidates were presented as \u2018candidate X\u2019. In Dutch, it is possible to indicate the different sex of these candidates (\u2018kandidaat\u2019 for the male candidate and \u2018kandidate\u2019 for the female candidate). Likewise gender-linked pronouns were used in the instructional paragraphs and questions. In all other respects, speeches and questionnaires were identical, in order not to provide any cues to the salience of gender. The presented stimuli included several elements: a text message, an image of the ballot (where we indicated the list position of the candidate) and a facial silhouette of the hypothetical candidate. The inclusion of facial silhouettes is innovative and is a subtle cue to respondents about the sex of the candidate. Previous studies mostly indicated the sex of the presented candidate by presenting him/her with a clear male/female name (e.g. Dolan, 2014; Huddy & Terkildsen, 1993b; Matland, 1994; Rosenwasser et al., 1987), or by including images (see for example Aalberg & Jenssen, 2007; Lammers et al., 2009). However, psychical appearance also impacts on the perception of the presented candidates (Lammers et al., 2009). Furthermore, also names can evoke certain prejudices because they possibly remind respondents of someone with the same name or because they simply (dis)like the name. The text messages were made as centrist as possible, and were based on a mix of the party programs of the four Flemish centre parties (CD&V, Open VLD, N-VA and sp.a), the Flemish government agreement and Flemish parties\u2019 press statements. Manipulation checks were included to verify whether respondents were able to correctly answer questions about the candidate and the content of the message. All respondents had to answer a question about the sex of the presented candidate after the first treatment. Respondents who were not able to correctly answer this question could not further complete the questionnaire and their answers were not taken into account for the data analysis. We also included other manipulation checks, in order not to over-accentuate the importance of the candidate\u2019s sex. Furthermore, respondents were incentivized to read the text messages thoroughly by highlighting that a prize (iPad Air 2 128 GB) would be raffled among those who could answer all the substantive questions correctly. The most important advantage of an experimental approach is the possibility to control for a number of intervening factors. Several measures were taken to ensure that only our key variable (i.e. the sex of the candidate) plays a role in the evaluation made by the respondents. First, the institutional context was held constant by focusing on Flanders. Second, the characteristics of respondents were controlled by randomly assigning them to one of the different treatments and by making comparisons between experimental groups. Third, by using hypothetical candidates without partisan affiliation, we did not intervene in actual discussion nor was there any effect of pre-existing preferences or personal (dis)tastes. Taken together, all these measures offer a methodologically rigid test. The experiment was conducted in March-April 2017. Respondents were drawn from iVOX\u2019s internet-based access panel, which is the largest online panel in Flanders with about 150,000 potential respondents. 11,837 of them actually received an invitation to participate in our study and 4,052 agreed to participate. After discarding respondents who could not correctly answer the question about the sex of the first presented candidate (see above), we retained 2,500 participants. From this sample, we additionally excluded two categories of respondents. First, respondents who completed the survey too fast, and consequently gave random answers, were excluded. These so-called \u2018speeder respondents\u2019 were defined as those who completed the survey in less than half of the average completion time. Second, a question about the possible purpose of this study was included at the end of the survey. Twenty-seven respondents provided an answer that was in line with the purpose of our research. We decided to exclude the answers of those respondents as there might be a social desirability bias in these answers. However, since we also asked them to indicate at what point they found this out (while completing the questions for the first, second,\u2026, sixth candidate), we did not have to exclude all of their answers. The exact number of registered answers varies therefore by policy issue. After excluding these two types of respondents, we maintained a sample of 2,362 respondents (which is a response rate of 19.95 %). The external validity of our experiment is enhanced by conducting the study among a sample of the population, whereas most other studies analyse university students.

In this project, this underrepresentation of women in politics serves as the main starting point. More in particular, the role of political gender stereotypes as a source of voter bias is explored. Previous research on political gender stereotypes was mostly set in the context of the United States, where female representatives are rather scarce and concentrated within the Democratic Party. Generally, women were considered as competent in communal areas, such as education and health care, whereas male candidates excel in all other issue domains. Women are also perceived as more leftist than men. However, we cannot simply extrapolate the results of these American studies to other political systems, since the US has a distinct political culture and context. The European context, and List PR-systems in particular, has not been investigated in these matters. In this project, the focus is on Flanders (Belgium). The combination of a highly proportional List-PR system and a stringent quota system results in higher shares of elected women (one of the highest in the world), a very fragmented party system with female politicians relatively equally spread over the different parties, and less focus on individual candidates. These consequences of using a List-PR provide a political context that is more woman-friendly compared to majoritarian systems. Hence, this presents an interesting case to conduct research on the prevalence of political gender stereotypes.", "q16": "Our aim is to find out whether gender stereotypes are present in the Flemish political sphere. Our expectation is that general gender stereotypes will be reflected in politics in two ways: perceptions that female and male politicians have different issue competences and hold different ideological positions. Regarding the different areas of issue expertise, we expect that women, because they are typically seen as communal and social, will be stereotyped as having more competence in communal issues. Conversely, we expect that women will be perceived as being less competent in agentic issues. For neutral issues, we do not expect differences. This leads us to the following hypotheses: H1a: The perceived general competences of women candidates on agentic issues will be lower than that of men candidates. H1b: The perceived general competences of women candidates on neutral issues will be similar than that of men candidates. H1c: The perceived general competences of women candidates on communal issues will be higher than that of men candidates. Another component of political gender stereotypes is the different perception of the social attitudes and political beliefs of women (Diekman et al., 2002). Although women are more equally spread over the different parties in Flanders, we believe that also there female candidates will be perceived as being more leftist, since they are also seen as possessing communal traits, as more competent to handle communal issues and to write more legislation on women\u2019s issues (Welch & Thomas, 1991). H2: The perceived ideological position of women candidates will be more to the left than that of men candidates. Also list position cues are very important in the Flemish List-PR system. Following interaction theory (Peffley, Hurwitz, & Sniderman, 1997), both gender and list position cues potentially work in tandem to help voters to form coherent impressions (Kundra & Sinclair, 1999). We therefore also want to investigate whether women benefit from a head of list position. From a gender perspective, one could argue that a female candidate may benefit from a head of list position, because the information attached to this high list position (i.e. candidates listed first are highly competent) is deviant from the general impression of female candidates. Moreover, despite stringent quota regulations, the number of female head of list candidates is below that of male head of list candidates. Therefore, voters might have the impression that those female candidates who succeed in obtaining a top list position have to be extremely qualified. H3a: The perceived general competence of female head of list candidates will be higher than that of male head of list candidates. On the other hand, it is plausible to argue that female candidates with a middle of list position will be worse off. Quota regulations are often criticized for leading to the selection of unqualified candidates just to meet the quota standards (see for example J\u00falio & Tavares, 2017; Wauters, Maddens, & Put, 2014; Weeks & Baldez, 2015), which possibly result in lower levels of perceived competence for female middle of list candidates. H3b: The perceived general competence of female middle of list candidates will be lower than that of male middle of list candidates.", "q17": "These hypotheses will be tested on the basis of an experimental research design in which hypothetical candidates were presented to respondents in text messages in which only their sex, their position on the list and their policy position on a particular issue were mentioned. We did not mention the party affiliation of the presented candidates and the policy statements all took a centrist position, in order not to influence the assessment of the ideological position of the presented candidates. Our study used a 2x3x6 mixed complete block design. The candidate\u2019s sex (male versus female) and the list position (head of list, position in the middle or no list position mentioned) were manipulated as between-group factors. Six different policy issues were manipulated as within-groups factor. We included two topics that are generally perceived as being communal (health care and education), two agentic topics (defence and finance) and two gender-neutral topics (tourism and climate). This categorization is based on an extensive review of 16 international studies on the assignment of policy issues to men and women by three key actors, i.e. (mass) media, voters and party elites . We also checked whether these findings hold in our Flemish context by exploring literature on portfolio allocations and by looking at the appointment of male and female ministers to these issue domains. Respondents were randomly assigned to six different treatments. After each text message, respondents were asked to complete a questionnaire about the presented candidate and message, before continuing to the next profile. The order of the issue domains was randomized in order to control for order effects. There was also a random variation of male and female candidates, and of head of list and middle of list candidates. The hypothetical candidates were presented as \u2018candidate X\u2019. In Dutch, it is possible to indicate the different sex of these candidates (\u2018kandidaat\u2019 for the male candidate and \u2018kandidate\u2019 for the female candidate). Likewise gender-linked pronouns were used in the instructional paragraphs and questions. In all other respects, speeches and questionnaires were identical, in order not to provide any cues to the salience of gender. The presented stimuli included several elements: a text message, an image of the ballot (where we indicated the list position of the candidate) and a facial silhouette of the hypothetical candidate. The inclusion of facial silhouettes is innovative and is a subtle cue to respondents about the sex of the candidate.

The literature on legislative productivity and bureaucratic delegation collectively suggest that legislators engage in the statutory discretion in legislation to pursue credit claiming opportunities and minimize bureaucratic oversight.

I argue that an increase in a legislator\u2019s electoral competition results in an increase in statutory discretion. I utilize a within-subject natural experiment in California to test the effect of a change in a California State Senate district\u2019s party registration and president\u2019s vote share on the State Senator\u2019s statutory discretion in introductory legislation before and after the California Citizens Redistricting Commission\u2019s inaugural release of the California Senate district maps in 2011 and 2012.

Empirical test: Paired difference-in-means t-test for the subgroup to determine effect of last year in elected office as a lame duck legislator; unpaired difference-in-means t-tests to compare lame duck legislators in their last term or last year to legislators running for reelection or election. H2 (Higher office): If a legislator is running for election to higher office, the legislator will grant less statutory discretion to the bureaucracy. Empirical test: Unpaired difference-in-means t-test to compare legislators running for reelection or election to the same type of elected office compared to legislators running for reelection or election to higher office; paired and unpaired difference-in-means t-test to test interaction effect by election year (i.e., whether running for a higher office in 2012 or not.) H3 (Electoral competition): If a legislator is subject to an increase in electoral competition, the legislator will grant more statutory discretion to the bureaucracy. Empirical test: Paired difference-in-means t-test by categorical measure of electoral competition in current and future legislative districts; regression analysis with categorical/continuous measure of electoral competition in current and future legislative districts with individual member fixed effects. H4 (Electoral competition \u2013 future district): If a legislator is subject to an increase in electoral competition in their future district (i.e., the district he/she will run in the next election), the legislator will grant more statutory discretion to the bureaucracy. Empirical test: (Same empirical test as H3, but focus on future district variables to determine legislators\u2019 past or future-oriented behavior.) Paired difference-in-means t-test by categorical measure of electoral competition in current and future legislative districts; regression analysis with categorical/continuous measure of electoral competition in current and future legislative districts with individual member fixed effects; paired and unpaired difference-in-means t-test to test interaction effect by election year (i.e., whether running for a higher office in 2012 or not.) H5 (Election year): If a legislator running for election or reelection to elected office in an election year, the legislator will grant more statutory discretion to the bureaucracy. Empirical test: Unpaired difference-in-means t-test to compare legislators running for reelection or election in an election year (2012) to legislators running for reelection or election not in an election year."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "Approximately 40 California State Senators; 1600 introduced bills"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Since this is a natural experiment, the \"intervention\" was carried out by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission's release of the 2012 State Senate district maps in spring/summer 2011."}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "D72, D78"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections", "Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Do Electorally-Vulnerable Legislators Grant More or Less Statutory Discretion?", "q2": "Mona Vakilifathi", "q3": "20180211AA", "q4": "02/11/2018 - 13:09", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher analysis of outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "2/10/18", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "What is the effect of electoral competition on statutory discretion? The literature on legislative productivity and bureaucratic delegation collectively suggest that legislators engage in the statutory discretion in legislation to pursue credit claiming opportunities and minimize bureaucratic oversight. If legislators are single-minded seekers of reelection, it is necessary to determine the effect of individual electoral competition on statutory discretion. I argue that an increase in a legislator\u2019s electoral competition results in an increase in statutory discretion. I utilize a within-subject natural experiment in California to test the effect of a change in a California State Senate district\u2019s party registration and president\u2019s vote share on the State Senator\u2019s statutory discretion in introductory legislation before and after the California Citizens Redistricting Commission\u2019s inaugural release of the California Senate district maps in 2011 and 2012.
