In intentional vignettes, response options clearly mention the character's intentions, and refer to specific actions that the character might take.

"}}}, "recommended-hypothesis": {"value": {"question4a": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "question5a": {"extra": [], "value": "Rationale:\nHuman beings make rapid social judgments about how trustworthy a person is on the basis of their facial appearance (Bar, Neta, &amp; Linz, 2006; Todorov, 2013; Todorov, Said, Engell, &amp; Oosterhof, 2008). These \u201cfirst impressions\u201d have been shown to have significant effects on subsequent behavior, including decisions about whom to trust in an economic game and which politician one will vote for in an election (Falvello, Vinson, Ferrari, &amp; Todorov, 2015; Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010). Inferences about trustworthiness of a face with a neutral expression appear to be related to mechanisms for detecting emotional facial expressions (more trustworthy faces tend to appear more happy, while more untrustworthy faces tend to appear more angry); it has thus been suggested that face-based judgments of trustworthiness thus serve the function of anticipating people\u2019s behavioral intentions (Ames, Fiske, &amp; Todorov, 2011; Todorov, 2008; Westra, 2017). This idea has very significant implications for our understanding of other socio-cognitive processes that involve the attribution of intentions, especially moral cognition (Greene et al., 2009; Leslie, Knobe, &amp; Cohen, 2006): it suggests that we use people\u2019s faces to inform our judgments about their moral behavior. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested, and it is unclear whether the effects of facial trustworthiness on social behavior reflect substantive predictions about intentions, or simple affective preferences.\nThe primary aim of this study is to examine how social judgments based on facial appearance affect our expectations about people\u2019s moral decision-making. Specifically, we will investigate whether participants are inclined to expect that a person with a \u201ctrustworthy\u201d face will make moral choices, and that of a person with an \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d face will make immoral choice. To do this, we will present participants with vignettes paired with computer-generated images of male faces created with the program FaceGen (https://facegen.com/) that have been previously shown to elicit strong judgments of trustworthiness (Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008). Trustworthy, untrustworthy, and neutral faces will be randomly paired with vignettes in which an agent is faced with a moral decision, and participants will be asked to attribute positive or negative moral intentions to them. We expect to find a main effect of facial trustworthiness on moral intention attributions.\nIn Study 1, we found that facial appearance did indeed have a significant effect on whether participants attributed positive or negative moral intentions to an agent: the more untrustworthy a face appeared, the moral likely participants were to judge that the protagonist in the vignette had immoral intentions. \nHowever, it is possible that participants in this earlier study were simply associating trustworthy faces with positive outcomes and untrustworthy faces with negative outcomes. To control for this alternative \u201cvalence-matching\u201d hypothesis and to replicate our original results, the current study will introduce a new set of 30 \"unintentional\" control vignettes (replacing the 30 distractor vignettes from the survey in study 1), in which participants are asked to make predictions about whether a positive or negative event will befall the protagonist. If the \u201cvalence-matching\u201d hypothesis is correct, we should expect to find comparable effects of facial trustworthiness in both the intentional and unintentional control trials; however, if our original hypothesis is correct, we should expect to find a significant effect of facial trustworthiness in our moral intention trials, but not in our control trials. \n\n\nReferences:\nAmes, D.

Crucially, participants\u2019 responses were biased toward attributing positive moral intentions to characters with trustworthy facial features (z = 4.06, p &lt; .001) and negative moral intentions to characters with untrustworthy features (z = 5.58, p &lt; .001). Participants\u2019 attributions toward neutral faces were not biased one way or the other (z = .10, p = .691).\"\nH2: If the valence-matching explanation of this previous finding is correct, and participants were simply mapping positive faces onto positive outcomes and negative faces onto negative outcomes, rather than making inferences about the characters' underlying intentions based on their facial features, then we should expect a similar effect of face type on negative/positive responses  as observed in study 1 in both the intentional and unintentional trials. If however the intentions-based account is correct, then we should expect to replicate the effect of face type observed in study 1 in the intentional trials only.", "description-hypothesis.question2a": "A further prediction of the intention-attribution hypothesis is that we might observe an interaction between Face Type and Trial Type, such that the effect of face type on predicted outcomes is significantly different in intentional and unintentional trials. The shape of this interaction could however take many forms, however. \n1. It could be that there is no effect of face-type in unintentional trials. This would suggest that participants do not view facial trustworthiness as relevant to questions about whether good or bad things happen to an agent. This would be fairly clear evidence against the valence-matching hypothesis.\n2. It could also be that the effect of face type on outcomes in unintentional trials is similar in shape to the effect of that we expect to observe in intentional trials (if study 1's results are replicated), albeit significantly weaker. This would suggest that valence-matching contributed to the effects observed in study 1, but that intention-tracking affected outcome choices over and above valence-matching. \n3. We might also observe a significant effect of face-type in the unintentional conditions, albeit with a shape that is distinct from (or even the inverse of) the effect observed in study 1 (e.g. participants might be more likely to predict that positive outcomes will befall people with untrustworthy or neutral faces, and that negative outcomes will befall people with trustworthy faces). Such an interaction effect would count as evidence against the valence-matching explanation of the findings in study 1.", "description-hypothesis.question3a": "Our manipulation of facial trustworthiness is based on pre-validated stimuli provided by Alexander Todorov. See Oosterhof, N. N., &amp; Todorov, A. (2008). The functional basis of face evaluation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 105, 11087-11092.\n\nIn this study, we introduced a new variable: trial type (intentional vs. unintentional). For several reasons, a manipulation check is not appropriate for a study with this design.\n1. In intentional vignettes, response options clearly mention the character's intentions, and refer to specific actions that the character might take. In unintentional vignettes, outcomes are always the product of forces beyond the character's control, and the character's intentions are never mentioned. The relevance of intentions in the different trials is very clear. \n2. Trial type is manipulated within-subjects. All participants will see both types of trial.\n3. To ensure that intentional and unintentional trials are otherwise well-matched, test trials were selected via a norming procedure in two separate pilot studies (one for intentional vignettes and one of unintentional vignettes). Vignettes were presented to MTurkers in the absence of facial trustworthiness information, and vignettes that strong positive or negative response biases were eliminated. To be included in the study, vignettes had to have a mean response score of 0 (i.e. no response bias towards negative or positive outcomes). ", "recommended-hypothesis.question4a": [], "recommended-hypothesis.question5a": "Rationale:\nHuman beings make rapid social judgments about how trustworthy a person is on the basis of their facial appearance (Bar, Neta, &amp; Linz, 2006; Todorov, 2013; Todorov, Said, Engell, &amp; Oosterhof, 2008). These \u201cfirst impressions\u201d have been shown to have significant effects on subsequent behavior, including decisions about whom to trust in an economic game and which politician one will vote for in an election (Falvello, Vinson, Ferrari, &amp; Todorov, 2015; Olivola &amp; Todorov, 2010). Inferences about trustworthiness of a face with a neutral expression appear to be related to mechanisms for detecting emotional facial expressions (more trustworthy faces tend to appear more happy, while more untrustworthy faces tend to appear more angry); it has thus been suggested that face-based judgments of trustworthiness thus serve the function of anticipating people\u2019s behavioral intentions (Ames, Fiske, &amp; Todorov, 2011; Todorov, 2008; Westra, 2017). This idea has very significant implications for our understanding of other socio-cognitive processes that involve the attribution of intentions, especially moral cognition (Greene et al., 2009; Leslie, Knobe, &amp; Cohen, 2006): it suggests that we use people\u2019s faces to inform our judgments about their moral behavior. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested, and it is unclear whether the effects of facial trustworthiness on social behavior reflect substantive predictions about intentions, or simple affective preferences.\nThe primary aim of this study is to examine how social judgments based on facial appearance affect our expectations about people\u2019s moral decision-making. Specifically, we will investigate whether participants are inclined to expect that a person with a \u201ctrustworthy\u201d face will make moral choices, and that of a person with an \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d face will make immoral choice. To do this, we will present participants with vignettes paired with computer-generated images of male faces created with the program FaceGen (https://facegen.com/) that have been previously shown to elicit strong judgments of trustworthiness (Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008). Trustworthy, untrustworthy, and neutral faces will be randomly paired with vignettes in which an agent is faced with a moral decision, and participants will be asked to attribute positive or negative moral intentions to them. We expect to find a main effect of facial trustworthiness on moral intention attributions.\nIn Study 1, we found that facial appearance did indeed have a significant effect on whether participants attributed positive or negative moral intentions to an agent: the more untrustworthy a face appeared, the moral likely participants were to judge that the protagonist in the vignette had immoral intentions. \nHowever, it is possible that participants in this earlier study were simply associating trustworthy faces with positive outcomes and untrustworthy faces with negative outcomes. To control for this alternative \u201cvalence-matching\u201d hypothesis and to replicate our original results, the current study will introduce a new set of 30 \"unintentional\" control vignettes (replacing the 30 distractor vignettes from the survey in study 1), in which participants are asked to make predictions about whether a positive or negative event will befall the protagonist. If the \u201cvalence-matching\u201d hypothesis is correct, we should expect to find comparable effects of facial trustworthiness in both the intentional and unintentional control trials; however, if our original hypothesis is correct, we should expect to find a significant effect of facial trustworthiness in our moral intention trials, but not in our control trials. \n\n\nReferences:\nAmes, D.
