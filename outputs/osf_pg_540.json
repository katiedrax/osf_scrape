graded membership. Three dimensions of prototypicality have been proposed: intentionality, task relatedness, and the most recent addition, constraint (also known as the freely-moving thoughts dimension). In the current study, we examined whether changes in task dif\ufb01culty would in\ufb02uence the rate of constrained versus unconstrained thoughts. Prior work has shown that mind wandering varies with task-dif\ufb01culty and has been interpreted as resulting from either an executive resource trade-off or a failure in executive control. Here, we examine the influence of task difficulty on the thought constraint dimension of mind wandering.\n\nIn a prior experiment we showed increases in freely-moving thoughts in an easy versus difficult task. We however, did not measure task-relatedness and it is possible that the change in rates of freely-moving thoughts merely reflects changes in task-unrelated thoughts.\n\nHere, we manipulated task dif\ufb01culty via working memory load using an n-back task (e.g., Baird et al., 2012; Konishi, McLaren, Engen, &amp; Smallwood, 2015; Smallwood et al., 2011). Participants viewed a series of numbers indicating whetheratargetwasevenorodd. In the\u201ceasy\u201dgroup,participants would indicate whether the currently presented number was even or odd (0-back) and in the \u201chard\u201d task, participants had to indicate whether the number presented two trials ago was even or odd (2-back). Periodically throughout the task we asked participants to indicate whether their thoughts were currently freely-moving or not. Finally, O\u2019Neill et al. (2019) suggested that the constraint dimension might, in some way, be related to the concept of a \u201c\ufb02ow state\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2014) or \u201cdeep effortless concentration\u201d (Marty-Dugas &amp; Smilek, 2019). We therefore, included a brief survey at the end of the experiment to determine whether rates of unconstrained thoughts correspond with reports of effortless concentration or \u201c\ufb02ow\u201d.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesized that the proportion of freely-moving thoughts will be higher in the easy and difficult tasks during both task-related and task-unrelated mind wandering."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Three dimensions of prototypicality have been proposed: intentionality, task relatedness, and the most recent addition, constraint (also known as the freely-moving thoughts dimension). In the current study, we examined whether changes in task dif\ufb01culty would in\ufb02uence the rate of constrained versus unconstrained thoughts. Prior work has shown that mind wandering varies with task-dif\ufb01culty and has been interpreted as resulting from either an executive resource trade-off or a failure in executive control. Here, we examine the influence of task difficulty on the thought constraint dimension of mind wandering.\n\nIn a prior experiment we showed increases in freely-moving thoughts in an easy versus difficult task. We however, did not measure task-relatedness and it is possible that the change in rates of freely-moving thoughts merely reflects changes in task-unrelated thoughts.\n\nHere, we manipulated task dif\ufb01culty via working memory load using an n-back task (e.g., Baird et al., 2012; Konishi, McLaren, Engen, &amp; Smallwood, 2015; Smallwood et al., 2011). Participants viewed a series of numbers indicating whetheratargetwasevenorodd. In the\u201ceasy\u201dgroup,participants would indicate whether the currently presented number was even or odd (0-back) and in the \u201chard\u201d task, participants had to indicate whether the number presented two trials ago was even or odd (2-back). Periodically throughout the task we asked participants to indicate whether their thoughts were currently freely-moving or not. Finally, O\u2019Neill et al. (2019) suggested that the constraint dimension might, in some way, be related to the concept of a \u201c\ufb02ow state\u201d (Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2014) or \u201cdeep effortless concentration\u201d (Marty-Dugas &amp; Smilek, 2019). We therefore, included a brief survey at the end of the experiment to determine whether rates of unconstrained thoughts correspond with reports of effortless concentration or \u201c\ufb02ow\u201d.\n", "q4": "We hypothesized that the proportion of freely-moving thoughts will be higher in the easy and difficult tasks during both task-related and task-unrelated mind wandering.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

characterize cognitive impairment due to taxane chemotherapy in terms of memory, executive function, processing of information, concentration, verbal memory, and depression.\n\u2022\tTo summarize cognitive outcomes in breast cancer patients receiving taxanes chemotherapy.\nSearches\nWe will use numerous resources to identify records for inclusion in this systematic review. \n\nElectronic searches\nThe following databases will be searched:\n\u2022\tThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); \n\u2022\tMEDLINE All (through OvidSP) to date;\n\u2022\tPsycINFO (through OvidSP) to date;\n\u2022\tEmbase (through OvidSP) to date;\n\u2022\tSCOPUS \n\u2022\tCINAHL (through EBSCO) to date.\nWe will search the databases for publications from 1980, the year when studies showing cognitive impairments as a result of chemotherapy began to appear in the literature (Ahles 2012) and taxane started to be widely used as chemotherapy.\n\nWe will put the search strategy for MEDLINE in here when it\u2019s finalized.\n\n\nSearching other resources \nReference lists\nWe will  examine reference lists of all included records to find additional relevant citations. We will also read reference lists of pertinent reviews or clinical guidelines for related records. Additionally, we also examine papers citing our included papers or pertinent reviews or clinical guidelines.\nTrial registers\nWe will also search the following trial registries in order to identify unpublished studies: \n\u2022\tClinicalTrials.gov https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ \n\u2022\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/).\n\u2022\tThese registries will be consulted with a search combining cancer terms, taxane terms, and cognitive terms.\n\nConference papers, dissertations, and theses will not be sought and will not be included. \nTypes of study to be included\nWe will include randomized controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), observational studies, chart reviews\nIn the data analysis we will consider if study designs were high quality or not, and subgroup analysis will be used to determine if conclusions from research with high quality and non-high quality designs are equivalent.\n\nCondition or domain being studied\nCognitive impairment and breast cancer.\nParticipants/population\nInclusion criteria:\n\u2022\tAdult patients with breast cancer, at any stage, with the exception of patients with brain metastases \n\u2022\tMinimum age18 and maximum age 69.\n\u2022\tPatients who had received taxane treatment (alone or in combination with other treatments);\n\u2022\tPatients who were tested for any cognitive impairment following the taxane treatment of their breast cancer;\n\u2022\tPatients who completed standard-dose taxane at least 6 months prior to assessment of cognitive impairment. Six months after treatment was chosen as a cutoff point to exclude assessment of the acute effects of chemotherapy.   \n.   Exclusion criteria:\n\n\u2022\tStage IV patients with brain metastasis will be excluded because of the direct effect of the tumor on the brain and consequently cognitive function;\n\u2022\tWe will exclude research literature involving children, teenagers and adolescents. \n\nIntervention(s), exposure(s)\nTaxane therapy is the intervention/exposure.

The search will have three concepts, each one operationalized with both keywords and controlled vocabulary (in the databases where controlled vocabulary is available): cognitive function, breast cancer, and taxanes. Some limits will be used in the search: a date limit excluding papers published before 1980 and a language limit excluding papers not published in English. Additionally, articles whose indexing makes clear that they address only children or that they are not eligible study designs will be excluded from the screening set. The complete search strategy for MEDLINE is attached to this protocol registration. All the searches will be posted on an Open Science Framework project.\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently screen titles and abstracts for relevancy in Covidence. In the full text screening stage, EI and ME will inspect the full texts of potentially-relevant records independently to judge on the eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion will be documented. \nThe authors (BC and BEE) will resolve any disagreement between the two review authors. We will include a PRISMA flow-diagram to display the screening process (Liberati 2009).\n\nData extraction and management\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently extract data from the included studies. Hereto, a data extraction form will be set up in accordance with the checklist proposed by Cochrane (Higgins 2011) and the CReDECI 2-guideline (M\u00f6hler 2015). Where possible, the following data will be obtained from every study:\n\u2022\tStudy information: authors, publication year, source of publication.\n\u2022\tMethods: study design, study duration, type of randomization, types of controls\n\u2022\tIntervention: Duration and frequency of taxane therapy\n\u2022\tOutcomes: primary and secondary outcome(s) domains and , time points, screening or assessment tool/methodology, timing of assessment in relation to completion of therapy.\n\u2022\tStudy results: sample size (number assigned to the intervention and control group), mean age of sample, education of the sample, concurrent radiation, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy regimen, cancer stage, results of primary outcomes relevant to the review focus, results of secondary outcomes relevant to the review focus.\n\u2022\tEvaluation of potential bias: sample size calculation, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, reporting on outcome data, other sources of bias (e.g. interventions being insufficiently well-delivered; the conduct of the study is affected by interim results; recruiting additional participants from a subgroup showing more benefit; an insensitive instrument is used to measure outcomes).\nIn case of disagreement, discussion will take place to reach consensus or an additional review author will be involved (EI, ME, BEE, BC, SM). When any of the record information is missing or unclear, we will attempt to contact the authors of the study to obtain further details.\nRisk of bias (quality) assessment\nAll references to tables and figures are to those in the full protocol in The Cochrane handbook.\n\nAssessment of risk bias in included studies \nRandomized studies\nTwo reviewers (EI and ME) will independently assess the risk of bias of included RCTs by using Cochrane's tool for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins 2011). \nEach of the domains of potential bias will be labelled as \u2018high risk\u2019, \u2018low risk\u2019 or \u2018unclear risk\u2019.\n \n\nStrategy for data synthesis\nData synthesis\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe will only perform meta-analysis if a group of studies is satisfactorily homogeneous to provide a significant summary. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by estimation of the I2 statistic, \nWe will determine pooled estimates in different subgroups of studies to determine their consistency. \nWe will investigate and report possible reasons for any substantial statistical heterogeneity.\nAssessment of reporting biases\nFunnel plot will be produced in order to assess the publication bias. If any asymmetry of were found, it will be tested statistically.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe will conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strength of our findings by, for instance, re-running analyses without studies believed to have a high risk of bias. \nAnalysis of subgroups or subsets\nWe will conduct the following subgroup analyses (whenever possible):\n\u2022\tcancer stage;\n\u2022\ttype of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tduration of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tage;\n\u2022\teducation;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment method;\n\u2022\tcognitive function domains;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment cutoffs.\nStudies with a RCT design and studies with a NRCT design will be considered as two subgroups in the analysis of results. If there is agreement in the conclusions resulting from RCTs and NRCTs, one conclusion on the effect of taxanes on cognition will be taken into account.\n\nIf considerable heterogeneity in outcome is found within these two subgroups of studies, we will try to explain the heterogeneity by assessing potential differences in clinical characteristics as age, co-morbidities, education, socio-economic status. If we find that several studies are focused on these specific characteristics, we will perform subgroup-analyses. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution given that multiple statistical analyses may generate spurious results. \n\n\nContact details for further information\nEiman Ibrahim eiman.ibrahim@yale.edu \nBarbara Ehrlich barbara.ehrlich@yale.edu\nOrganisational affiliation of the review\nThe Cochrane Collaboration\nhttp://www.cochrane.org/\nReview team members and their organizational affiliations\nEiman Ibrahim, MD.

Additionally, we also examine papers citing our included papers or pertinent reviews or clinical guidelines.\nTrial registers\nWe will also search the following trial registries in order to identify unpublished studies: \n\u2022\tClinicalTrials.gov https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ \n\u2022\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/).\n\u2022\tThese registries will be consulted with a search combining cancer terms, taxane terms, and cognitive terms.\n\nConference papers, dissertations, and theses will not be sought and will not be included. \nTypes of study to be included\nWe will include randomized controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), observational studies, chart reviews\nIn the data analysis we will consider if study designs were high quality or not, and subgroup analysis will be used to determine if conclusions from research with high quality and non-high quality designs are equivalent.\n\nCondition or domain being studied\nCognitive impairment and breast cancer.\nParticipants/population\nInclusion criteria:\n\u2022\tAdult patients with breast cancer, at any stage, with the exception of patients with brain metastases \n\u2022\tMinimum age18 and maximum age 69.\n\u2022\tPatients who had received taxane treatment (alone or in combination with other treatments);\n\u2022\tPatients who were tested for any cognitive impairment following the taxane treatment of their breast cancer;\n\u2022\tPatients who completed standard-dose taxane at least 6 months prior to assessment of cognitive impairment. Six months after treatment was chosen as a cutoff point to exclude assessment of the acute effects of chemotherapy.   \n.   Exclusion criteria:\n\n\u2022\tStage IV patients with brain metastasis will be excluded because of the direct effect of the tumor on the brain and consequently cognitive function;\n\u2022\tWe will exclude research literature involving children, teenagers and adolescents. \n\nIntervention(s), exposure(s)\nTaxane therapy is the intervention/exposure.

The search will have three concepts, each one operationalized with both keywords and controlled vocabulary (in the databases where controlled vocabulary is available): cognitive function, breast cancer, and taxanes. Some limits will be used in the search: a date limit excluding papers published before 1980 and a language limit excluding papers not published in English. Additionally, articles whose indexing makes clear that they address only children or that they are not eligible study designs will be excluded from the screening set. The complete search strategy for MEDLINE is attached to this protocol registration. All the searches will be posted on an Open Science Framework project.\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently screen titles and abstracts for relevancy in Covidence. In the full text screening stage, EI and ME will inspect the full texts of potentially-relevant records independently to judge on the eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion will be documented. \nThe authors (BC and BEE) will resolve any disagreement between the two review authors. We will include a PRISMA flow-diagram to display the screening process (Liberati 2009).\n\nData extraction and management\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently extract data from the included studies. Hereto, a data extraction form will be set up in accordance with the checklist proposed by Cochrane (Higgins 2011) and the CReDECI 2-guideline (M\u00f6hler 2015). Where possible, the following data will be obtained from every study:\n\u2022\tStudy information: authors, publication year, source of publication.\n\u2022\tMethods: study design, study duration, type of randomization, types of controls\n\u2022\tIntervention: Duration and frequency of taxane therapy\n\u2022\tOutcomes: primary and secondary outcome(s) domains and , time points, screening or assessment tool/methodology, timing of assessment in relation to completion of therapy.\n\u2022\tStudy results: sample size (number assigned to the intervention and control group), mean age of sample, education of the sample, concurrent radiation, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy regimen, cancer stage, results of primary outcomes relevant to the review focus, results of secondary outcomes relevant to the review focus.\n\u2022\tEvaluation of potential bias: sample size calculation, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, reporting on outcome data, other sources of bias (e.g. interventions being insufficiently well-delivered; the conduct of the study is affected by interim results; recruiting additional participants from a subgroup showing more benefit; an insensitive instrument is used to measure outcomes).\nIn case of disagreement, discussion will take place to reach consensus or an additional review author will be involved (EI, ME, BEE, BC, SM). When any of the record information is missing or unclear, we will attempt to contact the authors of the study to obtain further details.\nRisk of bias (quality) assessment\nAll references to tables and figures are to those in the full protocol in The Cochrane handbook.\n\nAssessment of risk bias in included studies \nRandomized studies\nTwo reviewers (EI and ME) will independently assess the risk of bias of included RCTs by using Cochrane's tool for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins 2011). \nEach of the domains of potential bias will be labelled as \u2018high risk\u2019, \u2018low risk\u2019 or \u2018unclear risk\u2019.\n \n\nStrategy for data synthesis\nData synthesis\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe will only perform meta-analysis if a group of studies is satisfactorily homogeneous to provide a significant summary. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by estimation of the I2 statistic, \nWe will determine pooled estimates in different subgroups of studies to determine their consistency. \nWe will investigate and report possible reasons for any substantial statistical heterogeneity.\nAssessment of reporting biases\nFunnel plot will be produced in order to assess the publication bias. If any asymmetry of were found, it will be tested statistically.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe will conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strength of our findings by, for instance, re-running analyses without studies believed to have a high risk of bias. \nAnalysis of subgroups or subsets\nWe will conduct the following subgroup analyses (whenever possible):\n\u2022\tcancer stage;\n\u2022\ttype of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tduration of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tage;\n\u2022\teducation;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment method;\n\u2022\tcognitive function domains;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment cutoffs.\nStudies with a RCT design and studies with a NRCT design will be considered as two subgroups in the analysis of results. If there is agreement in the conclusions resulting from RCTs and NRCTs, one conclusion on the effect of taxanes on cognition will be taken into account.\n\nIf considerable heterogeneity in outcome is found within these two subgroups of studies, we will try to explain the heterogeneity by assessing potential differences in clinical characteristics as age, co-morbidities, education, socio-economic status. If we find that several studies are focused on these specific characteristics, we will perform subgroup-analyses. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution given that multiple statistical analyses may generate spurious results. \n\n\nContact details for further information\nEiman Ibrahim eiman.ibrahim@yale.edu \nBarbara Ehrlich barbara.ehrlich@yale.edu\nOrganisational affiliation of the review\nThe Cochrane Collaboration\nhttp://www.cochrane.org/\nReview team members and their organizational affiliations\nEiman Ibrahim, MD.

Additionally, we also examine papers citing our included papers or pertinent reviews or clinical guidelines.\nTrial registers\nWe will also search the following trial registries in order to identify unpublished studies: \n\u2022\tClinicalTrials.gov https://ClinicalTrials.gov/ \n\u2022\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/).\n\u2022\tThese registries will be consulted with a search combining cancer terms, taxane terms, and cognitive terms.\n\nConference papers, dissertations, and theses will not be sought and will not be included. \nTypes of study to be included\nWe will include randomized controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), observational studies, chart reviews\nIn the data analysis we will consider if study designs were high quality or not, and subgroup analysis will be used to determine if conclusions from research with high quality and non-high quality designs are equivalent.\n\nCondition or domain being studied\nCognitive impairment and breast cancer.\nParticipants/population\nInclusion criteria:\n\u2022\tAdult patients with breast cancer, at any stage, with the exception of patients with brain metastases \n\u2022\tMinimum age18 and maximum age 69.\n\u2022\tPatients who had received taxane treatment (alone or in combination with other treatments);\n\u2022\tPatients who were tested for any cognitive impairment following the taxane treatment of their breast cancer;\n\u2022\tPatients who completed standard-dose taxane at least 6 months prior to assessment of cognitive impairment. Six months after treatment was chosen as a cutoff point to exclude assessment of the acute effects of chemotherapy.   \n.   Exclusion criteria:\n\n\u2022\tStage IV patients with brain metastasis will be excluded because of the direct effect of the tumor on the brain and consequently cognitive function;\n\u2022\tWe will exclude research literature involving children, teenagers and adolescents. \n\nIntervention(s), exposure(s)\nTaxane therapy is the intervention/exposure.

The search will have three concepts, each one operationalized with both keywords and controlled vocabulary (in the databases where controlled vocabulary is available): cognitive function, breast cancer, and taxanes. Some limits will be used in the search: a date limit excluding papers published before 1980 and a language limit excluding papers not published in English. Additionally, articles whose indexing makes clear that they address only children or that they are not eligible study designs will be excluded from the screening set. The complete search strategy for MEDLINE is attached to this protocol registration. All the searches will be posted on an Open Science Framework project.\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently screen titles and abstracts for relevancy in Covidence. In the full text screening stage, EI and ME will inspect the full texts of potentially-relevant records independently to judge on the eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion will be documented. \nThe authors (BC and BEE) will resolve any disagreement between the two review authors. We will include a PRISMA flow-diagram to display the screening process (Liberati 2009).\n\nData extraction and management\nTwo review authors (EI and ME) will independently extract data from the included studies. Hereto, a data extraction form will be set up in accordance with the checklist proposed by Cochrane (Higgins 2011) and the CReDECI 2-guideline (M\u00f6hler 2015). Where possible, the following data will be obtained from every study:\n\u2022\tStudy information: authors, publication year, source of publication.\n\u2022\tMethods: study design, study duration, type of randomization, types of controls\n\u2022\tIntervention: Duration and frequency of taxane therapy\n\u2022\tOutcomes: primary and secondary outcome(s) domains and , time points, screening or assessment tool/methodology, timing of assessment in relation to completion of therapy.\n\u2022\tStudy results: sample size (number assigned to the intervention and control group), mean age of sample, education of the sample, concurrent radiation, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy regimen, cancer stage, results of primary outcomes relevant to the review focus, results of secondary outcomes relevant to the review focus.\n\u2022\tEvaluation of potential bias: sample size calculation, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, reporting on outcome data, other sources of bias (e.g. interventions being insufficiently well-delivered; the conduct of the study is affected by interim results; recruiting additional participants from a subgroup showing more benefit; an insensitive instrument is used to measure outcomes).\nIn case of disagreement, discussion will take place to reach consensus or an additional review author will be involved (EI, ME, BEE, BC, SM). When any of the record information is missing or unclear, we will attempt to contact the authors of the study to obtain further details.\nRisk of bias (quality) assessment\nAll references to tables and figures are to those in the full protocol in The Cochrane handbook.\n\nAssessment of risk bias in included studies \nRandomized studies\nTwo reviewers (EI and ME) will independently assess the risk of bias of included RCTs by using Cochrane's tool for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins 2011). \nEach of the domains of potential bias will be labelled as \u2018high risk\u2019, \u2018low risk\u2019 or \u2018unclear risk\u2019.\n \n\nStrategy for data synthesis\nData synthesis\n\nAssessment of heterogeneity\nWe will only perform meta-analysis if a group of studies is satisfactorily homogeneous to provide a significant summary. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by estimation of the I2 statistic, \nWe will determine pooled estimates in different subgroups of studies to determine their consistency. \nWe will investigate and report possible reasons for any substantial statistical heterogeneity.\nAssessment of reporting biases\nFunnel plot will be produced in order to assess the publication bias. If any asymmetry of were found, it will be tested statistically.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nWe will conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strength of our findings by, for instance, re-running analyses without studies believed to have a high risk of bias. \nAnalysis of subgroups or subsets\nWe will conduct the following subgroup analyses (whenever possible):\n\u2022\tcancer stage;\n\u2022\ttype of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tduration of chemotherapy;\n\u2022\tage;\n\u2022\teducation;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment method;\n\u2022\tcognitive function domains;\n\u2022\tcognitive status assessment cutoffs.\nStudies with a RCT design and studies with a NRCT design will be considered as two subgroups in the analysis of results. If there is agreement in the conclusions resulting from RCTs and NRCTs, one conclusion on the effect of taxanes on cognition will be taken into account.\n\nIf considerable heterogeneity in outcome is found within these two subgroups of studies, we will try to explain the heterogeneity by assessing potential differences in clinical characteristics as age, co-morbidities, education, socio-economic status. If we find that several studies are focused on these specific characteristics, we will perform subgroup-analyses. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution given that multiple statistical analyses may generate spurious results. \n\n\nContact details for further information\nEiman Ibrahim eiman.ibrahim@yale.edu \nBarbara Ehrlich barbara.ehrlich@yale.edu\nOrganisational affiliation of the review\nThe Cochrane Collaboration\nhttp://www.cochrane.org/\nReview team members and their organizational affiliations\nEiman Ibrahim, MD.

If there is agreement in the conclusions resulting from RCTs and NRCTs, one conclusion on the effect of taxanes on cognition will be taken into account.\n\nIf considerable heterogeneity in outcome is found within these two subgroups of studies, we will try to explain the heterogeneity by assessing potential differences in clinical characteristics as age, co-morbidities, education, socio-economic status. If we find that several studies are focused on these specific characteristics, we will perform subgroup-analyses. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution given that multiple statistical analyses may generate spurious results. \n\n\nContact details for further information\nEiman Ibrahim eiman.ibrahim@yale.edu \nBarbara Ehrlich barbara.ehrlich@yale.edu\nOrganisational affiliation of the review\nThe Cochrane Collaboration\nhttp://www.cochrane.org/\nReview team members and their organizational affiliations\nEiman Ibrahim, MD.

Date\t1/7/2020\nResearchers\tAshley J. Thomas, Rebecca Saxe, Elizabeth Spelke\nLogic and Hypothesis\tInfants recognize affiliation. Previous studies have suggested that infants recognize several signals of affiliation\u2014they infer affiliation when they see others imitating, synchronizing, speaking a common language, or comforting one another. For example, 4 and 5-month-old infants expect that an individual who imitates someone will approach them later (Powell &amp; Spelke, 2016). Seven-month-old infants expect that individuals who synchronize their actions, by facing one another and moving in a circle, will move in the same pattern later (Powell &amp; Spelke, 2013). Nine-month-olds expect that people who speak the same language will act friendly toward one another (Liberman, Woodward, &amp; Kinzler, 2017). And 15-month-old infants expect that two individuals who are comforted by a common one, will affiliate with one another by touching and synchronizing their actions (Spokes &amp; Spelke, 2017).\nAffiliation affects how infants feel about others. There is also evidence that when infants observe affiliative behaviors, they positively evaluate those who perform the affiliative behaviors. In a previous study we found that when infants observe novel others, they prefer those who imitate others over those who do not imitate others and those who are not imitated by others over those who are imitated by others (Thomas, Saxe, Spelke, in prep). This could be because infants prefer those who may be good social partners, and being imitated does not give infants information to that end. (For example, one can be imitated without even knowing it).\nIn the current study we ask whether infants prefer those who are imitated by their caregivers, which may tell the infant that that individual is part of their social group, or liked by their caregiver. In other words, infants may implicitly think \u2018my caregiver likes that person, so should I\u2019\nSample Size\tN = 30 participants, or until we have tested at least 16 infants and have a Bayes Factor of 8 for the reaching preference in the caregiver condition.\n\nThis number is based on results in a previous study we conducted, where we found a positive result testing ~28 infants. We also tested a small pilot sample of participants (see tables below).\nParticipant Age\tFull-term infants who are between the ages of 11.5 and 12.5 months\nMethods and Design\tThis study investigates how infants evaluate individuals they see their caregivers affiliate with. We are using imitation as a cue of affiliation. Each infant will see one vignette with their caregiver interacting with puppets and another vignette with another infant\u2019s caregiver interacting with puppets. When possible, we will match the caregivers on ethnicity and gender.\n\nGeneral Procedure\nTrial Structure: Familiarization (5x); Visual Preference Test; Reaching Preference Test\nFirst, each infant sees one of the two videos (repeated five times), followed by a visual preference test and a manual preference test. Then, they will see other video (repeated five times), again, followed by a visual preference test, and a manual preference test. Each infant will see one set of videos in which their caregiver interacts with puppets and another set of videos in which another caregiver interacts with puppets, whether the infant sees their caregiver, or another caregiver first will be counterbalanced across participants (See Figure 1).\n \nFigure 1. Schematic Diagram of General Procedure, with an example of a possible pairing of videos.\n\nDuring the familiarization trials, infants see the same video repeated five times, with an attention-grabbing animation between each trial (A star that rotates and makes a noise). If the baby looks away for more than half of the trial on the 4th trial, the procedure will be cut short and we will move on to the choice procedure.\nDuring the preferential looking test, each puppet from the video appears on opposite sides of the screen for two 10 second intervals for a total of 20 seconds. There is a knocking sound at the beginning of each interval to get the infant\u2019s attention.\nDuring the manual preference test, an experimenter, blind to condition, brings out the two puppets from the video and holds them in front of the screen. She says, \u2018Hi!\u2019 to get the attention of the baby, while still holding them in front of the screen. Then she says, \u2018look!\u2019 and brings the puppets together in front of the baby but out of reach of the participant. When the experimenter says \u2018look\u2019 the puppets disappear from the screen (controlled by a second experimenter hidden from the infant\u2019s view). She holds this position until the baby looks at both puppets. Then, she pushes the puppets toward the baby and says \u2018who do you like?\u2019. While presenting the two puppets to the infant, the experimenter holds the puppets approximately 12\u201d apart. If the baby does not make a choice after the experimenter counts 10 seconds in her head, she further prompts the baby by saying, \u2018Which one do you like\u201d or saying, \u2018Its ok to choose one\u2019. She does this every ten seconds until the baby chooses one or she does it three times. If the baby has still not made a choice after three times she will repeat the whole choice procedure up to three times. If the infant reaches for both puppets at the same time, the choice will be coded as \u2018both\u2019 and will not be included in the analysis, if the infant fails to reach for either puppet after three attempts, the choice will be coded as \u2018none\u2019.\nThroughout the experiment, there will be a live coder who is coding whether the infant is watching the screen or not. This coding will be used later to determine whether an infant will be excluded due to inattentiveness (see exclusion criteria below).\n\nIf infants become inattentive (if they look away for more than 50% of a trial) during the familiarization trials, and the infant has seen at least 3 trials, the experimenter will skip to the preferential looking and reaching task. We do not anticipate this happening very often given our previous study and pilot results.\n\nDescription of Vignette\nOne puppet is imitated by caregiver, one puppet is not.\nHere we investigate whether infants prefer the targets of imitation and if it matters whether their caregiver or another caregiver is doing the imitation. First, one puppet will make a noise (e.g. \u2018whoop whoop\u2019). Then, the caregiver will either imitate the first puppet by making the same noise, or the caregiver will make a different noise. Then, the other puppet will make a new noise (e.g. \u2018eee eee\u2019) and the caregiver will either imitate it by making the same noise or will make a different noise.  Half of the infants will see videos where their caregiver interacts with a purple and green puppet (half of which will see their caregiver imitate the purple puppet, and half of which will see their caregiver imitate the green puppet). And half of the infants will see videos where their caregiver interacts with an orange and blue puppet (half of which will see their caregiver imitate the blue puppet and half of which will see their caregiver imitate the orange puppet). (See Figure 2)\n\n\n \nFigure 2 One puppet is imitated, one puppet is not imitated.\n\nExperimenter blinding: The experimenter who will present the puppets to the infants for the reaching preference procedure will be blind to condition. The live coder, and the coder who will code the looking preference will also be blind to these conditions.\n\nThe caregivers will also be blind to which puppet they imitated. The videos are made by caregivers using their webcams at home and following audio instructions. Then the puppets are \u2018cropped\u2019 into the video so it looks like they are interacting. Therefore, the caregivers will not know which puppet they imitated and which puppet they did not imitate.\n\t\nDV s\tThe primary dependent measures are preferential looking and reaching.\nPreferential Reaching: Infants will also be presented with both puppets from the experiment and which puppet they reach for will be recorded on video tape. These will be recorded at the time of the experiment (by entering into a spreadsheet), and will be coded by a blind experimenter who will review the videos. If there are disagreements, a 3rd experimenter, who will be blind to the condition, will settle the dispute.\nWe will also measure preferential looking as a secondary dependent measure: We will measure how much time infants look at each puppet in a preferential looking test after familiarization. To do this, infants will be presented with the two puppets on the sides of the screen, and after the experiment, a coder blind to condition will record how much time the infant spends looking at the two puppets.\nPrimary analysis\tWe will also use a Bayesian contingency table in JASP to calculate a Bayes Factor which will compare the likelihood that the two conditions have different proportions of infants choosing one puppet or another, or that they have the same proportion of infants choosing one puppet or another. We will perform a 1-sided test with the hypothesis being that the children are more likely to choose the puppet who was imitated by the caregiver in the caregiver condition.\n\nWe will use one-sided binomial tests to measure whether infants prefer to reach for one puppet more than the other. Again, we will use JASP to calculate p-values for a frequentist binomial test (two-tailed) and to calculate bayes factors for a bayesian proportion test. The priors for the proportion test will be a beta distribution with a=1 and b=1.\nSecondary analysis\tTo analyze infants\u2019 looking preference for one puppet or the other we will use t-tests to compare the proportion of time that infants look at the imitated puppet versus the other puppet in a preference test that will be conducted after the infants watch the familiarization trials. We will use JASP (JASP team, 2016) to perform both Bayesian and frequentist t-tests. The priors for the t-test will be a Cauchy prior, centered at 0 with a width of .707 (which is the default value in JASP).\nInterpretation of possible outcomes\tBelow are possible outcomes and how we would interpret these outcomes (preference here could be looking preference, reaching preference or both).\nInfants may prefer those who are imitated by their caregivers, but not those who are imitated by other caregivers.\nWe hypothesize that infants will use their caregivers as a \u2018social reference\u2019 when evaluating the two puppets. If infants see imitation as a cue of affiliation and prefer those who their caregivers affiliate with over those that they don\u2019t, they should prefer the puppet who is imitated by their caregiver over the puppet who is not imitated by their caregiver. This should not be the case when they are evaluating the puppets who are imitated and not imitated by another caregiver.\nWe anticipate that we will find reaching preferences, but not looking preferences. This is based on the previous study we did with novel individuals. However, we will report all findings in the final manuscript. We don\u2019t predict that these two measures will disagree, but if they do (i.e. if they reach more for one puppet but look more at another puppet), it could suggest an \u2018interest\u2019 in one puppet, but a willingness to interact with the other. Thus, a reaching preference will be interpreted as a stronger indicator of preference than the preferential looking measure.\nPilot results\tNo pilot data will be included in the final sample. The pilot data is included below.\nExclusion criteria\tParticipant exclusion:\nDecisions about whether a participant is excluded will be determined before their preference measures are coded.\nParticipants will be excluded based on the following criteria:\n\u25cf\tFussiness, as determined by the experimenter or caregiver, that ends the study prior to the test trial.\n\u25cf\tParental interference: peeks at stimuli during test, directs participant\u2019s attention to/away from the screen during test, does not wish to comply with instructions to close their eyes but still wishes to participate, interferes with baby\u2019s attention (by saying something during the experiment or doing something that is excessively distracting like trying to put a pacifier in the babies mouth repeatedly).\n\u25cf\tTechnical failure (e.g with the video recording or with the stimuli presentation)\n\u25cf\tInattentive: if infants do not watch at least 3 familiarization trials (as defined by watching 85% of the video)\nTest trial Exclusions:\nInfants will need to watch at least 85% of 3 familiarization trials to be included in the analysis. It is possible that an infant\u2019s data will be included for one of the conditions but not the other (e.g. if an infant misses the critical portion of a trial during the caregiver videos for more than 3 familiarization trials, but watched all of the non-caregiver videos ).\nFor the reaching preference, if the infant chooses both puppets at the same time or neither puppet, they will not be included in the analysis for reaching, but their looking preference data will still be coded and included.\nExclusion decisions\tParticipants will be excluded and replaced as the experiment is actively running if they meet any of the above criteria, either determined live at the time of the study or when reviewed after the experiment (again by a blind coder).\nOther analysis details\tResearchers will view videos of the test sessions at earlier points to check for exclusionary criteria or to collect reliability data. To check for reliability, we will select a subset of videotaped test sessions for a reliability coder to re-code. The coder will be unaware of the hypotheses of the study and the events seen by infants.\nPilot Data\t\n\n\nParticipant\tMom's name\tBaby Name\tCaregiver Video\tContrast\tcaregiver first?\tChoice\tCondition\n4\tMelissa\tHolly\tPickuBum\tWhoopCricka\tyes\tAnti\tCaregiver\n11\tAmanda\tShea\tWhoop Cricka\tBumKazaa\tyes\tAnti\tCaregiver\n4\tMelissa\tHolly\tPickuBum\tWhoopCricka\tyes\tAnti\tNon-Caregiver\n5\tMicheal?\tMason\tPickuBum\tCrickaEEE\tyes\tAnti\tNon-Caregiver\n8\tMarcia\tAbigail\tCrickaEEE\tBumKazaa\tno\tAnti\tNon-Caregiver\n10\tAnsh\tRipley\tPickuBum\tCrickaEEE\tno\tAnti\tNon-Caregiver\n2\tSophia\tMaya\tWhoopCricka\tPickuBum\tno\tNA\tNon-Caregiver\n6\tKathleen F.\tgenevieve\tBumKazaa\tCrickaEEE\tno\tNA\tNon-Caregiver\n9\tLindsey\tSilas\tWhoop Cricka\tPickuBum\tyes\tNA\tNon-Caregiver\n11\tAmanda\tShea\tWhoop Cricka\tBumKazaa\tyes\tAnti\tNon-Caregiver\n2\tSophia\tMaya\tWhoopCricka\tPickuBum\tno\tPro\tCaregiver\n3\tElise\tBrighton\tBumKazaa\tWhoopCricka?\tno\tPro\tCaregiver\n5\tMicheal?\tMason\tPickuBum\tCrickaEEE\tyes\tPro\tCaregiver\n6\tKathleen F.\tgenevieve\tBumKazaa\tCrickaEEE\tno\tPro\tCaregiver\n8\tMarcia\tAbigail\tCrickaEEE\tBumKazaa\tno\tPro\tCaregiver\n13\tYuncheng\tHannah\tBumKazaa\tWhoopCricka\tyes\tPro\tCaregiver\n14\tTyler/Stella\tElitza\tCrickaEEE\t\tyes\tPro\tCaregiver\n3\tElise\tBrighton\tBumKazaa\tWhoopCricka?\tno\tPro\tNon-Caregiver\n13\tYuncheng\tHannah\tBumKazaa\tWhoopCricka\tyes\tPro\tNon-Caregiver\n14\tTyler/Stella\tElitza\tCrickaEEE\t\tno\tPro\tNon-Caregiver\n9\tLindsey\tSilas\tWhoop Cricka\tPickuBum\tyes\tPro\tCaregiver\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Caregiver Pre-Registration.pdf"}, "nodeId": "z8r7t", "sha256": "fc02d12ced3a5f870432a7aac05a46931caac35cb9fbc42434c429f4fff76d2f", "viewUrl": "/project/z8r7t/files/osfstorage/5e14a7d0573419021e8082af", "selectedFileName": "Caregiver Pre-Registration.pdf"}], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"summary": "\nTitle\tDo infants prefer those who affiliate with their caregivers?\nStart Date\t1/7/2020\nResearchers\tAshley J.

It is possible that an infant\u2019s data will be included for one of the conditions but not the other (e.g. if an infant misses the critical portion of a trial during the caregiver videos for more than 3 familiarization trials, but watched all of the non-caregiver videos ).\nFor the reaching preference, if the infant chooses both puppets at the same time or neither puppet, they will not be included in the analysis for reaching, but their looking preference data will still be coded and included.\nExclusion decisions\tParticipants will be excluded and replaced as the experiment is actively running if they meet any of the above criteria, either determined live at the time of the study or when reviewed after the experiment (again by a blind coder).\nOther analysis details\tResearchers will view videos of the test sessions at earlier points to check for exclusionary criteria or to collect reliability data. To check for reliability, we will select a subset of videotaped test sessions for a reliability coder to re-code. The coder will be unaware of the hypotheses of the study and the events seen by infants.\nPilot Data\t\n\n\nParticipant\tMom's name\tBaby Name\tCaregiver Video\tContrast\tcaregiver

Providing Intensive Mentoring and \u201cWraparound\u201d Supports for Disengaged Chicago Youth", "description": "This project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Youth Advocate Programs\u2019 (YAP) community-based intensive mentorship and \u201cwraparound\u201d support program. YAP\u2019s year-long programming helps at-risk youth in Chicago re-engage in school and avoid contact with the criminal justice system. The program pairs youth with a dedicated mentor (\u201cadvocate\u201d) who is on call 24/7 to provide mentoring and \u201cwraparound\u201d support services. These services are aimed at helping youth meet basic needs (transportation, clothes, etc.), helping them reconnect with school and succeed in the classroom, and providing motivation and direction toward completing larger goals such as employment or college.
