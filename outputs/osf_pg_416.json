Other studies have shown, however, that diminished responsiveness may be driven not by the the racial identity of the constituent per se, but by whether constituents and representatives share similar identities, such as coethnicity (McClendon, 2016; Broockman, 2013). In previous work, we conducted an audit experiment with state legislators to determine the drivers of discrimination against racial minorities (Gell-Redman et al., 2016). We found that constituent race, rather than nativity or latent propensity to vote, was the main driver of responsiveness. We revisit that work here, using a novel data set of state legislator racial characteristics. Specifically, we test whether that data we collected in our experiment contains not only evidence of bias towards racial out-groups but also evidence of bias based on coethnicity.

Recent experimental work has focused on how the responsiveness of elected and appointed officials might be influenced by out-group bias (Butler and Broockman, 2011; Gell-Redman et al., 2016; White, Nathan and Faller, 2015; Hughes et al., 2016). Other studies have shown, however, that diminished responsiveness may be driven not by the the racial identity of the constituent per se, but by whether constituents and representatives share similar identities, such as coethnicity (McClendon, 2016; Broockman, 2013). In previous work, we conducted an audit experiment with state legislators to determine the drivers of discrimination against racial minorities (Gell-Redman et al., 2016). We found that constituent race, rather than nativity or latent propensity to vote, was the main driver of responsiveness. We revisit that work here, using a novel data set of state legislator racial characteristics. Specifically, we test whether that data we collected in our experiment contains not only evidence of bias towards racial out-groups but also evidence of bias based on coethnicity. The remainder of this document describes the data, experimental design, and proposed analysis.", "q16": "Using new data on the race of U.S. state legislators, the proposed study will extend our prior work by examining two treatment effects. First, we will estimate the effect of race on responsiveness, conditional on the state legislator\u2019s own ethnicity.

This suggests that they are influenced not only by their immediate kinship networks (Sircar, 2015), but also by local actors beyond their kinship network. In rural India, a whole array of local characters plays such a role during electoral campaigns (Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Chauchard, 2016), as candidates and party networks rely on a variety of locally known, influential citizens to draw crowds to meetings, canvass and eventually attempt to convince voters. These individuals also play a role between elections, as they serve as intermediaries between elected officials and citizens, assisting citizens access the state and assisting elected officials with the mobilization of citizens and with the implementation of their policies. While they have sometimes been clubbed under one label, as \"brokers\" or \"intermediaries\", these local-level actors are astonishingly diverse. The literatures on distributive politics, \"claim-making\" and electoral campaigns in India (Manor, 2000; Krishna 2002; Auerbach, 2013; Dunning and Nilekani, 2013; Bussell, 2014; Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Kruks-Wisner, 2015; Chauchard, 2016) suggest that these actors may be elected or unelected, partisan or non-partisan, that they may belong to a variety of caste and ethnic groups, and that they may be more or less proximate to voters on a number of different dimensions. As a result of this diversity, we still know very little about the identity, the role and the relative ability of these crucial actors. In light of this lack of data, and in light of the diversity of these individuals, this project has several objectives, which we will likely explore in several different papers (or more likely, in several different chapters of a book manuscript): 1. Generate descriptive data on the profile of these local actors. 2. Document the role that these different types of locally influential actors play in village life. Specifically: (a) Determine which influencers better know villagers. Relatedly, determine which villagers does each type of local influencers know best and which villagers does each type of influencer have information on. (b) Make inferences as to which villagers each of these local actors are willing to help and assist in their interactions with the state. 3. Finally and most importantly, determine which of these influencers are better at mobilizing and persuading citizens. That is, determine which individual-level characteristics of these local \"influencers\" makes them the most effective at mobilizing and persuading citizens, and in reverse, from which kinds of influencers voters are most likely to take their cues at the local level (This also allows us to determine the kinds of voters that different subtypes of influencers are likely to be able to mobilize and/or persuade). The attached PAP details our research strategy to make inferences on all of these questions. The \"hypotheses\" section below outlines specific hypotheses relevant to the more causal and quantitative parts of the project, i.e. points 2a, 2b and 3 above."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "See

This suggests that they are influenced not only by their immediate kinship networks (Sircar, 2015), but also by local actors beyond their kinship network. In rural India, a whole array of local characters plays such a role during electoral campaigns (Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Chauchard, 2016), as candidates and party networks rely on a variety of locally known, influential citizens to draw crowds to meetings, canvass and eventually attempt to convince voters. These individuals also play a role between elections, as they serve as intermediaries between elected officials and citizens, assisting citizens access the state and assisting elected officials with the mobilization of citizens and with the implementation of their policies. While they have sometimes been clubbed under one label, as \"brokers\" or \"intermediaries\", these local-level actors are astonishingly diverse. The literatures on distributive politics, \"claim-making\" and electoral campaigns in India (Manor, 2000; Krishna 2002; Auerbach, 2013; Dunning and Nilekani, 2013; Bussell, 2014; Bj\u00f6rkman, 2014; Kruks-Wisner, 2015; Chauchard, 2016) suggest that these actors may be elected or unelected, partisan or non-partisan, that they may belong to a variety of caste and ethnic groups, and that they may be more or less proximate to voters on a number of different dimensions. As a result of this diversity, we still know very little about the identity, the role and the relative ability of these crucial actors. In light of this lack of data, and in light of the diversity of these individuals, this project has several objectives, which we will likely explore in several different papers (or more likely, in several different chapters of a book manuscript): 1. Generate descriptive data on the profile of these local actors. 2. Document the role that these different types of locally influential actors play in village life. Specifically: (a) Determine which influencers better know villagers. Relatedly, determine which villagers does each type of local influencers know best and which villagers does each type of influencer have information on. (b) Make inferences as to which villagers each of these local actors are willing to help and assist in their interactions with the state. 3. Finally and most importantly, determine which of these influencers are better at mobilizing and persuading citizens. That is, determine which individual-level characteristics of these local \"influencers\" makes them the most effective at mobilizing and persuading citizens, and in reverse, from which kinds of influencers voters are most likely to take their cues at the local level (This also allows us to determine the kinds of voters that different subtypes of influencers are likely to be able to mobilize and/or persuade). The attached PAP details our research strategy to make inferences on all of these questions.

Three short videos for each issue were produced and screened in rural Uganda, where these issues are prominent social concerns. The video vignettes were inserted in commercial breaks during films that were presented free of charge during a four-week film festival during November-December of 2015. Our experimental sample contains fifty-six village clusters that were assigned to seven different treatment arms: 3 pairs of messages, 3 single-message treatments, and one pure control.

The residual group are those who, according to their endline survey reports, neither attended nor have direct family or friendship ties to those who attended. We hypothesize that treatment effects become steadily weaker as we move from Compliers to Indirect Compliers to Others.

Or do they resist the facts when the evidence is politically uncongenial? A growing literature seeks to answer these questions, which have important implications for citizen competence and political accountability (e.g., Hochschild and Einstein 2015). One set of studies finds that people are often highly resistant to unwelcome information. For instance, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find that corrective information in mock news articles frequently fails to reduce salient misperceptions among ideologically vulnerable groups. Other studies that use relatively balanced formats have also found stiff resistance to uncongenial claims (Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013; Garrett, Nisbet, and Lynch 2013; Garrett and Weeks 2013). More notably, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find in two of five analyses that exposure to corrective information can increase the prevalence of misperceptions among vulnerable groups compared to those who read an article with no correction - a \u201cbackfire effect.\u201d However, other studies find that fact-checks or other forms of corrective information are at least somewhat successful at reducing misperceptions, with subjects accepting the correction provided to them (e.g., Weeks 2015; Nyhan and Reifler N.d.; Wood and Porter N.d.).[fn]Complicating matters further, Nyhan et al. (2014) and Nyhan and Reifler (2015) find that corrections about vaccine side effects reduce misperceptions even among people with less favorable attitudes toward vaccines, but also reduce their self-reported intention to vaccinate themselves or their children in the future.[\\fn] These studies, which may use less salient controversies and/or more one-sided stimuli, find that people - at least in some contexts or on some issues - are willing to update their beliefs. Most notably, Wood and Porter (2016) test for backfire effects across 32 issue areas and observe only one instance of backfire (the Iraq WMD item from Nyhan and Reifler 2010), but show that this result is sensitive to question wording. However, Wood and Porter do find widespread evidence of motivated reasoning - the effects of corrective information varied by respondent ideology for approximately 80% of the issues tested (i.e., correction effects were larger for ideologically agreeable factual corrections). In contrast, Nyhan and Reifler (N.d.), who largely test more obscure state-level fact-checks, find no evidence that respondents were more willing to update their beliefs in response to uncongenial fact-checks than for those that were favorable to their point of view. A third possibility is that people are willing to update their beliefs dispassionately, but interpret those facts in a belief-consistent manner. Using panel data from the Iraq War, Gaines et al. (2007) find that both Democrats and Republicans updated their beliefs as the facts changed, but that interpretations of the facts sharply diverged between the parties. In their telling, for instance, both groups recognized that WMD had not been found, but Democrats simply said that WMD did not exist, while Republicans explained that Saddam Hussein might have moved or destroyed the weapons or hidden them successfully from U.S. forces. We thus have three different accounts of how people\u2019s beliefs change (or not) in response to corrective information that we will test in the study described below. In the motivated resistance account, citizens strongly resist information that conflicts with their partisan or ideological commitments and may even double down on their misperceptions. By contrast, the belief updating account suggests that people generally accept new information and update their beliefs to be at least somewhat more accurate, though differences in responsiveness to corrective information based on prior attitudes may persist. Finally, the interpretations account proposes that citizens update their beliefs as new facts are presented to them but instead interpret those facts along partisan lines. However, the research described above neglects the role that elites can play in cultivating resistance to factual information. Research shows that elites wield disproportionate influence over mass attitudes (e.g., Zaller 1992; Lenz 2012). Can they cultivate public resistance to unwelcome information from neutral sources as well? Such a possibility would provide an alternate account for why corrections are often seemingly ineffective at changing persistent misperceptions over controversial issues. We will therefore also consider whether elite messages increase motivated resistance to unwelcome factual information and/or belief-consistent interpretations of that information. Moreover, we stage our experiment at the peak of the presidential election, when partisan commitments are strongest and the influence of partisan leaders is therefore likely to be strongest. Finally, this study will consider potential differences in respondent behavior across online panels that might affect the conclusions of studies of misperceptions. Though studies have found that Mechanical Turk workers provide valid survey data (e.g., Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012) and that the relationships between workers\u2019 characteristics and their attitudinal outcomes closely reflects those observed in more expensive traditional surveys (Druckman et al. 2016), concerns continue about social desirability bias in surveys conducted by interviewers who pay and evaluate respondents (e.g., Clifford and Jerit 2015). This concern may be particularly severe for studies of misperceptions. Respondents may be inclined to endorse corrective information provided during a study on Mechanical Turk to demonstrate that they read the stimuli assigned to them and/or were paying attention. This study will therefore consider whether the results differ between Mechanical Turk and the online panels such as SSI from which Morning Consult draws its respondents, providing vital guidance to future researchers seeking to exploit Mechanical Turk to measure factual receptivity."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "In this study, we will randomly assign respondents to one of five conditions. In a control condition, respondents will read a placebo article intended to provide a baseline for estimating experimental effects. Participants in the treatment conditions will instead read a version of a mock news article featuring a real factual misstatement by Donald Trump about crime rates from the current (2016) presidential campaign. In one treatment condition, participants will read an article that omits corrective information, allowing us to test the effect of exposure to misleading information alone. Others will be randomly assigned to a second treatment condition in which they read a version of the article that includes neutral corrective information from the FBI, allowing us to test its effects versus a no-correction version of the article as well as the control condition. Finally, two other treatment conditions will test whether elite political actors can cultivate resistance to factual information by randomizing whether the correction is followed by a statement by a partisan elite disparaging the validity of the information (the third treatment condition) or statements by the elite both disparaging the validity of the information and attributing a political motive to the source of the information (the fourth treatment condition, which uses the Hillary Clinton email scandal to question the motives of the FBI). Hypotheses: To recap, we seek to evaluate three theoretical approaches to understanding how voters respond to incongruent factual information, using support for Trump as the relevant prior attitude that affects respondents\u2019 propensity to engage in directionally motivated reasoning: H1: Motivated resistance Under H1, respondents are expected to resist unwelcome facts about controversial issues through mechanisms such as counterargument and source derogation. As a result, people exposed to attitude-inconsistent corrective information will not come to hold more accurate views. In some cases, their views could even become more inaccurate. If this hypothesis is correct, the correction provided in our study will not make Trump supporters more likely to correctly answer that crime has decreased over the past ten years. It could even make them more likely to say crime has increased over the previous ten years. Trump supporters who are exposed to corrective information should also be more likely to question the accuracy of crime statistics as well as the accuracy and fairness of the article (we intend to test the effect of treatments on these potential mechanisms directly). Motivated resistance to unwelcome corrective information is likely to become more severe when elites attack the source of the information or endorse a conspiracy theory about its origins. We therefore expect higher levels of misperceptions and more counterargument and source derogation when the accuracy of the information is questioned and its source is attacked. (H1 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.) H2: Differential acceptance Under H2, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts and update their beliefs to become more accurate, though the extent to which they update their beliefs may vary based on their prior attitude. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to generally reduce misperceptions, though acceptance of such information may vary by Trump support. We would similarly not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument under H3. However, when elites cultivate resistance to corrective information, it may undermine this pattern, especially among those respondents for whom rejecting the corrective information is politically congenial. (H2 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.) H3: Attitude-consistent interpretation Under H3, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts, but to instead adapt their interpretation of these facts to make them more consistent with their political commitments. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to decrease misperceptions but to observe increases in the extent to which people adopt politically congenial interpretations of the factual beliefs that they hold. We would not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument. (H3 does not offer clear expectations about how people will respond to elite arguments against corrective information.) We will also examine the following research questions where we have weaker priors: RQ1. Are respondents on Mechanical Turk more willing to update their beliefs in response to corrective information than respondents recruited from other online panels? RQ2. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect the salience of the issue or change people\u2019s policy views on the issue? RQ3. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect evaluations of the incumbent president (Obama), the candidate whose statement is questioned (Trump), or the candidate who is invoked in an elite attack on the correction (Clinton)?"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants: Participants will be U.S. residents age 18+ who agree to take part in the study as part of a Morning Consult survey (our module will be embedded within their poll) or workers on Mechanical Turk who agree to take part in this study. The Mechanical Turk survey has a target sample size of 3,000 respondents. The non-Mechanical Turk survey will be administered by Morning Consult, an online polling firm that works with academics, elected officials and media organizations. The Morning Consult sample, which is drawn from a number of online survey panel providers such as SSI and Research Now, will include up to 2,000 respondents (sample size TBD - depends on the number of Morning Consult respondents who consent to participate). Randomization approach: The study begins with a series of standard demographic questions (some of these will be omitted on Morning Consult if they are asked earlier in the survey), including respondent partisanship, ideology, candidate preference, political knowledge, and the importance of the issue of crime. Participants will then read one randomly assigned news article about either the ongoing presidential campaign or a beauty pageant (described further below). Randomized assignment to condition occurs via a randomizer within the Qualtrics survey environment. After randomization and exposure to treatment, subjects will be asked to share their perspective on the crime rate in the United States. Finally, participants will be informed that the news article was not real and that this research has no affiliation with any electoral candidate or political party and has received no financial support from any candidate or party. The complete text of both surveys is appended to this document. The experimental design used in the study is based on real news articles from July 2016 covering the Republican National Convention and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In his speech accepting the Republicans Party's nomination for president, Trump described an America ridden by increasing crime. His depictions did not appear to accord with the F.B.I. crime data, which tell a story of long-term secular decline. Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman at the time, was pressed about this discrepancy. Manafort responded by questioning the validity of the F.B.I. statistics and suggesting that the F.B.I. could not be trusted given their decision not to indict Hillary Clinton in her email scandal. We constructed our five experimental conditions, which are described below, to capture these events. All treatment articles are approximately the same length. Respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to one of the five conditions. Condition Crime Claim FBI Stats Correction Manafort Rejection HRC Conspiracy Placebo No No No No Trump Yes No No No Trump Correction Yes Yes No No Trump Correction/ Source Rejection Yes Yes Yes No Trump Correction/ Source/Conspiracy Yes Yes Yes Yes \u25cf Subjects in the Placebo condition are shown an article about birdwatching. \u25cf Subjects in the Trump condition are shown a news article on his claims about crime \u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction condition are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime and a correction based on F.B.I. statistics. \u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction/Source Rejection are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, and a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics. \u25cf Subjects in Trump Correction/Source/Conspiracy are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics, and Manafort's contention that the F.B.I. was not to be trusted because of their failure to indict Clinton. After reading their assigned article, subjects will answer two questions measuring respondents\u2019 recall of its content. They will then be asked if crime today is higher or lower than it was ten years ago and then asked if it somewhat or a lot higher/lower. Respondents will then be asked why the change they believe took place occurred. If subjects affirm that crime has decreased, they will be asked to choose among potential explanations for this decline; likewise, if subjects assert that crime has increased, they will also be asked to choose among explanations. In each case, we present subjects with several interpretations of the proposed change that will vary in how congenial they will be to respondents. These questions provide subjects a chance to interpret the facts as they understand them. Specifically, we expect that for respondents who believe that crime has gone down, the viewpoint-consistent interpretation for conservatives will be \u201cTougher policing and longer prison sentences,\u201d while the liberal choice will be \u201cThe improved economy and reduced unemployment.\u201d For those who believe that crime has gone up, the viewpoint-consistent conservative interpretation will be \u201cThe decline in morals and values\u201d and the liberal interpretation will be \u201cIncreased economic inequality and helplessness.\u201d Respondents are later asked to provide an additional post-treatment measure of the importance of crime, another potential way to interpret the study in a belief-consistent manner. Subjects will also be asked to evaluate the accuracy of federal crime statistics, the extent to which the article they read was accurate in its reporting of federal crime statistics, and whether they believe the article they read is biased or unfair. All of these represent potential mechanisms of counterargument for respondents who are resistant to the corrective information that was presented to them. Finally, respondents will be asked to provide their policy opinions on a series of issues including those related to crime and criminal justice and to evaluate a series of politicians including Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Outcome measures Primary outcome measures: Factual beliefs and interpretations Our primary factual belief outcome measures come from the following questions: We now would like to ask you some factual political questions.Would you say that, compared to ten years ago, the violent crime rate has gone up, stayed about the same, or gone down? - Gone up - Stayed about the same - Gone down If \u201cGone up\u201d is selected Compared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone up a lot or only somewhat? -Gone up a lot -Gone up somewhat If \u201cGone down\u201d is Selected Compared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone down a lot or only somewhat? -Gone down a lot -Gone down somewhat From these, we construct two outcome variables coded as follows where higher values indicate greater misperceptions: Scale: Binary: Gone down a lot (1) Gone down/Stayed the same (0) Gone down somewhat (2) Gone up (1) Stayed about the same (3) Gone up somewhat (4) Gone up a lot (5) To assess the interpretation hypothesis, we ask these questions. If \u201cGone down\u201d is selected: What would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone down? -Tougher policing and longer prison sentences -The improved economy and reduced unemployment -Some other reason -Don't know If \u201cGone up\u201d is selected: What would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone up? -The decline in morals and values -Increased economic inequality and helplessness -Some other reason -Don't know These questions are combined into a single variable coded as follows that distinguishes liberal and conservative interpretations of factual beliefs: -Crime up/inequality or Crime down/unemployment (-1) -Crime up/down for some other reason/don\u2019t know or crime unchanged (0) -Crime up/moral decline or Down/tougher policing (1) Secondary outcome measures: Source derogation, counterargument, and politician/candidate evaluation Higher values indicate greater source derogation and counterargument for these variables: In your view, how accurate are federal crime statistics? - Extremely accurate (1) -Somewhat accurate (2) -Not very accurate (3) - Not at all accurate (4) In your view, how accurate was the article you read in reporting federal crime statistics? -Extremely accurate (1) -Somewhat accurate (2) -Not very accurate (3) -Not at all accurate (4) (Due to an error in the survey instrument, this question was answered by respondents in the placebo condition. We may therefore omit this group from our analyses.) In your opinion, how fair was the article you read? - Extremely fair (1) -Somewhat fair (2) -Not very fair (3) -Not at all fair (4) We will construct a bias scale from the following questions: Would you say the article you read was biased or not biased? -Yes, biased -No, not biased If \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected Would you say the article had a liberal bias, a conservative bias, or some other bias? -Liberal -Conservative -Other If \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected Would you say the article was extremely biased, somewhat biased, or slightly biased? -Extremely biased -Somewhat biased -Slightly biased From these three questions about bias, we will construct a single outcome measure measuring the direction and extent of perceived bias. Extremely biased liberal (-3) Somewhat biased liberal (-2) Slightly biased liberal (-1) Not biased/biased-other (0) Slightly biased conservative (1) Somewhat biased conservative (2) Extremely biased conservative (3) Finally, we will evaluate evaluations of candidates and politicians using the following questions. Do you approve or disapprove of how Barack Obama is handling his job as president? -Strongly approve (5) -Somewhat approve (4) -Neither approve nor disapprove (3) -Somewhat disapprove (2) -Strongly disapprove (1) We ask the question \u201cDo you feel favorable or unfavorable toward each of these individuals?\u201d about Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and George W. Bush. Each is coded as follows: -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Statistical analyses: All models will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors. (Regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit.) Data from the Morning Consult and Mechanical Turk will be reported and analyzed separately. Each model will be estimated using this specification (no other covariates will be included): DVi,j = b0,j+b1,jTrump supporti + b2,jTrump messagei + b3,jTrump correctioni + b4,jTrump correction/source rejectioni + b5,jTrump correction/source/conspiracyi + b6,jTrump supporti*Trump messagei + b7,jTrump supporti*Trump correctioni + b8,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source rejectioni + b9,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source/conspiracyi + e Due to the relatively small number of voters who decline to support Trump or Clinton in our binary vote choice question and the unclear nature of their directional preferences, we plan to omit this group from our main estimates (but will report models that include them and includes appropriate interactions with the treatment conditions in an appendix). The omitted category for the Trump support indicator variable is thus Clinton support. We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities as described below, including the marginal effect of each treatment for the subgroup in question as well as well as the difference in marginal effects between subgroups. Unless otherwise specified, all tests will consider the effects of the treatments with respect to the uncorrected condition in which respondents are only exposed to Trump\u2019s message. In the models above, however, the reference category is the placebo condition (though we may estimate identical models that omit the placebo condition for expositional clarity and report these models in an appendix). We will also compute and report estimates with respect to the placebo condition, but consider such findings to be secondary outcome measures rather than direct tests of our hypotheses. (The reason is that the effect of the corrective conditions compared to the placebo is double-barrelled - subjects have been exposed to Trump\u2019s message and a correction.) These models will be estimated for the outcome variables defined above: factual beliefs about changes in crime (full scale and binary); interpretations of changes in crime; source derogation and counterargument (crime statistics, accuracy of reporting about crime statistics, fairness, and bias); importance of crime and policy preferences (harshness and spending); and politician evaluation (Obama approval and favorability of Obama, Clinton, and Trump). H1: Motivated resistance To evaluate H1, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is null or positive for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. In addition, we will conduct all of the tests described above for the outcome measures measuring source derogation and counterargument. H2: Differential acceptance To evaluate H2, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. H3: Attitude-consistent interpretation To evaluate H3, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for both Clinton and Trump supporters. We will also test whether interpretations are more likely to be viewpoint-consistent among respondents who receive corrective information than among those who don\u2019t. (We plan to additionally consider descriptive statistics on crime interpretations for the subgroups of those who say crime has gone up or down and to consider how those interpretations differ between Clinton and Trump supporters.) As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. RQ1. Differences in receptivity between Mechanical Turk and other online panel providers To evaluate RQ1, we will compare the results obtained in evaluating H1, H2, and H3 in both the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples per above, contrasting the treatment effects obtained across the two samples. We will also estimate pooled models for each model proposed to test H1, H2, and H3 that allow us to directly evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effects between samples conditional on Trump support and sample of origin. Given likely differences between the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples, we will estimate these models with indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge and report these results as well if they differ from those with covariates omitted. RQ2. Correction effects on issue salience and policy views To evaluate RQ2, we will estimate the marginal effect of correction exposure on the importance of crime and respondent policy preferences on the issue for both Clinton and Trump supporters (we will also estimate whether the marginal effects differ between them). As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. (In evaluating RQ2, we may also report a composite measure of crime preferences constructed from a principal components factor analysis if the measures scale together. We may also report an additional model for the post-treatment crime importance measure in which we control for the prior perceived importance of crime using a principal components factor analysis of pre-treatment questions asked about the issue.) RQ3. Correction effects on candidate/politician evaluations To evaluate RQ3, we will estimate the marginal effect of correction exposure on evaluations of Obama, Clinton, and Trump for both Clinton and Trump supporters (we will also estimate whether the marginal effects differ between them). As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. Additional notes: -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample as well as measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including both response timing data and accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the treatment articles. -All experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.). -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Note: We may estimate models that include a standard set of demographic covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge) if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models would be reported."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States of America"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "~1200 (Morning Consult), ~3000 (Mechanical Turk)"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "GW #081618, Dartmouth STUDY00029776, Exeter (no number), OSU #2016B0313"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "Dartmouth 8/24/16, Exeter 9/6/16, GW 9/21/16, OSU 9/29/16"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers, Morning Consult"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e38475457427b01650c524c", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fycaz/providers/osfstorage/5e38475457427b01650c524c", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fycaz/providers/osfstorage/5e38475457427b01650c524c", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fycaz/providers/osfstorage/5e38475457427b01650c524c?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/fycaz/providers/osfstorage/5e38475457427b01650c524c"}, "attributes": {"etag": "4f5d2a763c22a8e9c9bad97dd23c92bd98e596a316ee44bfc112fb3fb1cb12ba", "kind": "file", "name": "20161011AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e38475457427b01650c524c", "size": 238369, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "a6fb6036cfee382b5cdd9a90fd730389", "sha256": "9bab801f713c8057b7c0803a7bb5c98ce9fedf47f474cb2d9d09f8d3dca636dc"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 238369, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:16:20.789669+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "fycaz", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20161011AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:16:20+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "fycaz", "sha256": "9bab801f713c8057b7c0803a7bb5c98ce9fedf47f474cb2d9d09f8d3dca636dc", "viewUrl": "/project/fqh39/files/osfstorage/5e38475afa39b701691db94b/", "selectedFileName": "20161011AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20161011AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Factual Corrections During A Presidential Election", "q2": "Brendan Nyhan | Ethan Porter | Jason Reifler | Thomas J.

Or do they resist the facts when the evidence is politically uncongenial? A growing literature seeks to answer these questions, which have important implications for citizen competence and political accountability (e.g., Hochschild and Einstein 2015). One set of studies finds that people are often highly resistant to unwelcome information. For instance, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find that corrective information in mock news articles frequently fails to reduce salient misperceptions among ideologically vulnerable groups. Other studies that use relatively balanced formats have also found stiff resistance to uncongenial claims (Nyhan, Reifler, and Ubel 2013; Garrett, Nisbet, and Lynch 2013; Garrett and Weeks 2013). More notably, Nyhan and Reifler (2010) find in two of five analyses that exposure to corrective information can increase the prevalence of misperceptions among vulnerable groups compared to those who read an article with no correction - a \u201cbackfire effect.\u201d However, other studies find that fact-checks or other forms of corrective information are at least somewhat successful at reducing misperceptions, with subjects accepting the correction provided to them (e.g., Weeks 2015; Nyhan and Reifler N.d.; Wood and Porter N.d.).[fn]Complicating matters further, Nyhan et al. (2014) and Nyhan and Reifler (2015) find that corrections about vaccine side effects reduce misperceptions even among people with less favorable attitudes toward vaccines, but also reduce their self-reported intention to vaccinate themselves or their children in the future.[\\fn] These studies, which may use less salient controversies and/or more one-sided stimuli, find that people - at least in some contexts or on some issues - are willing to update their beliefs. Most notably, Wood and Porter (2016) test for backfire effects across 32 issue areas and observe only one instance of backfire (the Iraq WMD item from Nyhan and Reifler 2010), but show that this result is sensitive to question wording. However, Wood and Porter do find widespread evidence of motivated reasoning - the effects of corrective information varied by respondent ideology for approximately 80% of the issues tested (i.e., correction effects were larger for ideologically agreeable factual corrections). In contrast, Nyhan and Reifler (N.d.), who largely test more obscure state-level fact-checks, find no evidence that respondents were more willing to update their beliefs in response to uncongenial fact-checks than for those that were favorable to their point of view. A third possibility is that people are willing to update their beliefs dispassionately, but interpret those facts in a belief-consistent manner. Using panel data from the Iraq War, Gaines et al. (2007) find that both Democrats and Republicans updated their beliefs as the facts changed, but that interpretations of the facts sharply diverged between the parties. In their telling, for instance, both groups recognized that WMD had not been found, but Democrats simply said that WMD did not exist, while Republicans explained that Saddam Hussein might have moved or destroyed the weapons or hidden them successfully from U.S. forces. We thus have three different accounts of how people\u2019s beliefs change (or not) in response to corrective information that we will test in the study described below. In the motivated resistance account, citizens strongly resist information that conflicts with their partisan or ideological commitments and may even double down on their misperceptions. By contrast, the belief updating account suggests that people generally accept new information and update their beliefs to be at least somewhat more accurate, though differences in responsiveness to corrective information based on prior attitudes may persist. Finally, the interpretations account proposes that citizens update their beliefs as new facts are presented to them but instead interpret those facts along partisan lines. However, the research described above neglects the role that elites can play in cultivating resistance to factual information. Research shows that elites wield disproportionate influence over mass attitudes (e.g., Zaller 1992; Lenz 2012). Can they cultivate public resistance to unwelcome information from neutral sources as well? Such a possibility would provide an alternate account for why corrections are often seemingly ineffective at changing persistent misperceptions over controversial issues. We will therefore also consider whether elite messages increase motivated resistance to unwelcome factual information and/or belief-consistent interpretations of that information. Moreover, we stage our experiment at the peak of the presidential election, when partisan commitments are strongest and the influence of partisan leaders is therefore likely to be strongest. Finally, this study will consider potential differences in respondent behavior across online panels that might affect the conclusions of studies of misperceptions. Though studies have found that Mechanical Turk workers provide valid survey data (e.g., Berinsky, Huber, and Lenz 2012) and that the relationships between workers\u2019 characteristics and their attitudinal outcomes closely reflects those observed in more expensive traditional surveys (Druckman et al. 2016), concerns continue about social desirability bias in surveys conducted by interviewers who pay and evaluate respondents (e.g., Clifford and Jerit 2015). This concern may be particularly severe for studies of misperceptions. Respondents may be inclined to endorse corrective information provided during a study on Mechanical Turk to demonstrate that they read the stimuli assigned to them and/or were paying attention. This study will therefore consider whether the results differ between Mechanical Turk and the online panels such as SSI from which Morning Consult draws its respondents, providing vital guidance to future researchers seeking to exploit Mechanical Turk to measure factual receptivity.", "q16": "In this study, we will randomly assign respondents to one of five conditions. In a control condition, respondents will read a placebo article intended to provide a baseline for estimating experimental effects. Participants in the treatment conditions will instead read a version of a mock news article featuring a real factual misstatement by Donald Trump about crime rates from the current (2016) presidential campaign. In one treatment condition, participants will read an article that omits corrective information, allowing us to test the effect of exposure to misleading information alone. Others will be randomly assigned to a second treatment condition in which they read a version of the article that includes neutral corrective information from the FBI, allowing us to test its effects versus a no-correction version of the article as well as the control condition. Finally, two other treatment conditions will test whether elite political actors can cultivate resistance to factual information by randomizing whether the correction is followed by a statement by a partisan elite disparaging the validity of the information (the third treatment condition) or statements by the elite both disparaging the validity of the information and attributing a political motive to the source of the information (the fourth treatment condition, which uses the Hillary Clinton email scandal to question the motives of the FBI). Hypotheses: To recap, we seek to evaluate three theoretical approaches to understanding how voters respond to incongruent factual information, using support for Trump as the relevant prior attitude that affects respondents\u2019 propensity to engage in directionally motivated reasoning: H1: Motivated resistance Under H1, respondents are expected to resist unwelcome facts about controversial issues through mechanisms such as counterargument and source derogation. As a result, people exposed to attitude-inconsistent corrective information will not come to hold more accurate views. In some cases, their views could even become more inaccurate. If this hypothesis is correct, the correction provided in our study will not make Trump supporters more likely to correctly answer that crime has decreased over the past ten years. It could even make them more likely to say crime has increased over the previous ten years. Trump supporters who are exposed to corrective information should also be more likely to question the accuracy of crime statistics as well as the accuracy and fairness of the article (we intend to test the effect of treatments on these potential mechanisms directly). Motivated resistance to unwelcome corrective information is likely to become more severe when elites attack the source of the information or endorse a conspiracy theory about its origins. We therefore expect higher levels of misperceptions and more counterargument and source derogation when the accuracy of the information is questioned and its source is attacked. (H1 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.) H2: Differential acceptance Under H2, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts and update their beliefs to become more accurate, though the extent to which they update their beliefs may vary based on their prior attitude. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to generally reduce misperceptions, though acceptance of such information may vary by Trump support. We would similarly not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument under H3. However, when elites cultivate resistance to corrective information, it may undermine this pattern, especially among those respondents for whom rejecting the corrective information is politically congenial. (H2 does not offer clear expectations about how people interpret their factual beliefs.) H3: Attitude-consistent interpretation Under H3, respondents are expected to accept unwelcome facts, but to instead adapt their interpretation of these facts to make them more consistent with their political commitments. If this hypothesis is correct, we would expect corrective information to decrease misperceptions but to observe increases in the extent to which people adopt politically congenial interpretations of the factual beliefs that they hold. We would not expect corrective information to increase source derogation and counterargument. (H3 does not offer clear expectations about how people will respond to elite arguments against corrective information.) We will also examine the following research questions where we have weaker priors: RQ1. Are respondents on Mechanical Turk more willing to update their beliefs in response to corrective information than respondents recruited from other online panels? RQ2. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect the salience of the issue or change people\u2019s policy views on the issue? RQ3. Does exposure to corrective information about crime affect evaluations of the incumbent president (Obama), the candidate whose statement is questioned (Trump), or the candidate who is invoked in an elite attack on the correction (Clinton)?", "q17": "Eligibility and exclusion criteria for participants: Participants will be U.S. residents age 18+ who agree to take part in the study as part of a Morning Consult survey (our module will be embedded within their poll) or workers on Mechanical Turk who agree to take part in this study. The Mechanical Turk survey has a target sample size of 3,000 respondents. The non-Mechanical Turk survey will be administered by Morning Consult, an online polling firm that works with academics, elected officials and media organizations. The Morning Consult sample, which is drawn from a number of online survey panel providers such as SSI and Research Now, will include up to 2,000 respondents (sample size TBD - depends on the number of Morning Consult respondents who consent to participate). Randomization approach: The study begins with a series of standard demographic questions (some of these will be omitted on Morning Consult if they are asked earlier in the survey), including respondent partisanship, ideology, candidate preference, political knowledge, and the importance of the issue of crime. Participants will then read one randomly assigned news article about either the ongoing presidential campaign or a beauty pageant (described further below). Randomized assignment to condition occurs via a randomizer within the Qualtrics survey environment. After randomization and exposure to treatment, subjects will be asked to share their perspective on the crime rate in the United States. Finally, participants will be informed that the news article was not real and that this research has no affiliation with any electoral candidate or political party and has received no financial support from any candidate or party. The complete text of both surveys is appended to this document. The experimental design used in the study is based on real news articles from July 2016 covering the Republican National Convention and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In his speech accepting the Republicans Party's nomination for president, Trump described an America ridden by increasing crime. His depictions did not appear to accord with the F.B.I. crime data, which tell a story of long-term secular decline. Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman at the time, was pressed about this discrepancy. Manafort responded by questioning the validity of the F.B.I. statistics and suggesting that the F.B.I. could not be trusted given their decision not to indict Hillary Clinton in her email scandal. We constructed our five experimental conditions, which are described below, to capture these events. All treatment articles are approximately the same length. Respondents were randomly assigned with equal probability to one of the five conditions. Condition Crime Claim FBI Stats Correction Manafort Rejection HRC Conspiracy Placebo No No No No Trump Yes No No No Trump Correction Yes Yes No No Trump Correction/ Source Rejection Yes Yes Yes No Trump Correction/ Source/Conspiracy Yes Yes Yes Yes \u25cf Subjects in the Placebo condition are shown an article about birdwatching. \u25cf Subjects in the Trump condition are shown a news article on his claims about crime \u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction condition are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime and a correction based on F.B.I. statistics. \u25cf Subjects in the Trump Correction/Source Rejection are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, and a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics. \u25cf Subjects in Trump Correction/Source/Conspiracy are shown a news article summarizing his claims about crime, a correction based on F.B.I. statistics, a quotation from Manafort rejecting the F.B.I. statistics, and Manafort's contention that the F.B.I. was not to be trusted because of their failure to indict Clinton. After reading their assigned article, subjects will answer two questions measuring respondents\u2019 recall of its content. They will then be asked if crime today is higher or lower than it was ten years ago and then asked if it somewhat or a lot higher/lower. Respondents will then be asked why the change they believe took place occurred. If subjects affirm that crime has decreased, they will be asked to choose among potential explanations for this decline; likewise, if subjects assert that crime has increased, they will also be asked to choose among explanations. In each case, we present subjects with several interpretations of the proposed change that will vary in how congenial they will be to respondents. These questions provide subjects a chance to interpret the facts as they understand them. Specifically, we expect that for respondents who believe that crime has gone down, the viewpoint-consistent interpretation for conservatives will be \u201cTougher policing and longer prison sentences,\u201d while the liberal choice will be \u201cThe improved economy and reduced unemployment.\u201d For those who believe that crime has gone up, the viewpoint-consistent conservative interpretation will be \u201cThe decline in morals and values\u201d and the liberal interpretation will be \u201cIncreased economic inequality and helplessness.\u201d Respondents are later asked to provide an additional post-treatment measure of the importance of crime, another potential way to interpret the study in a belief-consistent manner. Subjects will also be asked to evaluate the accuracy of federal crime statistics, the extent to which the article they read was accurate in its reporting of federal crime statistics, and whether they believe the article they read is biased or unfair. All of these represent potential mechanisms of counterargument for respondents who are resistant to the corrective information that was presented to them. Finally, respondents will be asked to provide their policy opinions on a series of issues including those related to crime and criminal justice and to evaluate a series of politicians including Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Outcome measures Primary outcome measures: Factual beliefs and interpretations Our primary factual belief outcome measures come from the following questions: We now would like to ask you some factual political questions.Would you say that, compared to ten years ago, the violent crime rate has gone up, stayed about the same, or gone down? - Gone up - Stayed about the same - Gone down If \u201cGone up\u201d is selected Compared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone up a lot or only somewhat? -Gone up a lot -Gone up somewhat If \u201cGone down\u201d is Selected Compared to ten years ago, has the violent crime rate gone down a lot or only somewhat? -Gone down a lot -Gone down somewhat From these, we construct two outcome variables coded as follows where higher values indicate greater misperceptions: Scale: Binary: Gone down a lot (1) Gone down/Stayed the same (0) Gone down somewhat (2) Gone up (1) Stayed about the same (3) Gone up somewhat (4) Gone up a lot (5) To assess the interpretation hypothesis, we ask these questions. If \u201cGone down\u201d is selected: What would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone down? -Tougher policing and longer prison sentences -The improved economy and reduced unemployment -Some other reason -Don't know If \u201cGone up\u201d is selected: What would you say is the main reason violent crime has gone up? -The decline in morals and values -Increased economic inequality and helplessness -Some other reason -Don't know These questions are combined into a single variable coded as follows that distinguishes liberal and conservative interpretations of factual beliefs: -Crime up/inequality or Crime down/unemployment (-1) -Crime up/down for some other reason/don\u2019t know or crime unchanged (0) -Crime up/moral decline or Down/tougher policing (1) Secondary outcome measures: Source derogation, counterargument, and politician/candidate evaluation Higher values indicate greater source derogation and counterargument for these variables: In your view, how accurate are federal crime statistics? - Extremely accurate (1) -Somewhat accurate (2) -Not very accurate (3) - Not at all accurate (4) In your view, how accurate was the article you read in reporting federal crime statistics? -Extremely accurate (1) -Somewhat accurate (2) -Not very accurate (3) -Not at all accurate (4) (Due to an error in the survey instrument, this question was answered by respondents in the placebo condition. We may therefore omit this group from our analyses.) In your opinion, how fair was the article you read? - Extremely fair (1) -Somewhat fair (2) -Not very fair (3) -Not at all fair (4) We will construct a bias scale from the following questions: Would you say the article you read was biased or not biased? -Yes, biased -No, not biased If \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected Would you say the article had a liberal bias, a conservative bias, or some other bias? -Liberal -Conservative -Other If \u201cYes, biased\u201d Is Selected Would you say the article was extremely biased, somewhat biased, or slightly biased? -Extremely biased -Somewhat biased -Slightly biased From these three questions about bias, we will construct a single outcome measure measuring the direction and extent of perceived bias. Extremely biased liberal (-3) Somewhat biased liberal (-2) Slightly biased liberal (-1) Not biased/biased-other (0) Slightly biased conservative (1) Somewhat biased conservative (2) Extremely biased conservative (3) Finally, we will evaluate evaluations of candidates and politicians using the following questions. Do you approve or disapprove of how Barack Obama is handling his job as president? -Strongly approve (5) -Somewhat approve (4) -Neither approve nor disapprove (3) -Somewhat disapprove (2) -Strongly disapprove (1) We ask the question \u201cDo you feel favorable or unfavorable toward each of these individuals?\u201d about Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and George W. Bush. Each is coded as follows: -Very favorable (5) -Somewhat favorable (4) -Neither favorable nor unfavorable (3) -Somewhat unfavorable (2) -Very unfavorable (1) Statistical analyses: All models will be estimated using OLS with robust standard errors. (Regression results for binary dependent variables will be verified for robustness using probit. Regression results for individual ordered dependent variables will be verified for robustness using ordered probit. Regression results for ordered scales constructed from multinomial data will be verified for robustness using multinomial logit or multinomial probit.) Data from the Morning Consult and Mechanical Turk will be reported and analyzed separately. Each model will be estimated using this specification (no other covariates will be included): DVi,j = b0,j+b1,jTrump supporti + b2,jTrump messagei + b3,jTrump correctioni + b4,jTrump correction/source rejectioni + b5,jTrump correction/source/conspiracyi + b6,jTrump supporti*Trump messagei + b7,jTrump supporti*Trump correctioni + b8,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source rejectioni + b9,jTrump supporti*Trump correction/source/conspiracyi + e Due to the relatively small number of voters who decline to support Trump or Clinton in our binary vote choice question and the unclear nature of their directional preferences, we plan to omit this group from our main estimates (but will report models that include them and includes appropriate interactions with the treatment conditions in an appendix). The omitted category for the Trump support indicator variable is thus Clinton support. We will compute and report appropriate auxiliary quantities as described below, including the marginal effect of each treatment for the subgroup in question as well as well as the difference in marginal effects between subgroups. Unless otherwise specified, all tests will consider the effects of the treatments with respect to the uncorrected condition in which respondents are only exposed to Trump\u2019s message. In the models above, however, the reference category is the placebo condition (though we may estimate identical models that omit the placebo condition for expositional clarity and report these models in an appendix). We will also compute and report estimates with respect to the placebo condition, but consider such findings to be secondary outcome measures rather than direct tests of our hypotheses. (The reason is that the effect of the corrective conditions compared to the placebo is double-barrelled - subjects have been exposed to Trump\u2019s message and a correction.) These models will be estimated for the outcome variables defined above: factual beliefs about changes in crime (full scale and binary); interpretations of changes in crime; source derogation and counterargument (crime statistics, accuracy of reporting about crime statistics, fairness, and bias); importance of crime and policy preferences (harshness and spending); and politician evaluation (Obama approval and favorability of Obama, Clinton, and Trump). H1: Motivated resistance To evaluate H1, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is null or positive for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. In addition, we will conduct all of the tests described above for the outcome measures measuring source derogation and counterargument. H2: Differential acceptance To evaluate H2, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for Trump supporters and whether the difference in treatment effects is significant versus Clinton supporters. As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. We will also test directly whether the marginal effect of the elite resistance messages on misperceptions is greater than the effect of the neutral correction condition for Trump supporters and whether this effect differs from Clinton supporters. H3: Attitude-consistent interpretation To evaluate H3, we will test whether the marginal effect of exposure to the correction conditions on misperceptions about changes in crime is negative for both Clinton and Trump supporters. We will also test whether interpretations are more likely to be viewpoint-consistent among respondents who receive corrective information than among those who don\u2019t. (We plan to additionally consider descriptive statistics on crime interpretations for the subgroups of those who say crime has gone up or down and to consider how those interpretations differ between Clinton and Trump supporters.) As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. RQ1. Differences in receptivity between Mechanical Turk and other online panel providers To evaluate RQ1, we will compare the results obtained in evaluating H1, H2, and H3 in both the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples per above, contrasting the treatment effects obtained across the two samples. We will also estimate pooled models for each model proposed to test H1, H2, and H3 that allow us to directly evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effects between samples conditional on Trump support and sample of origin. Given likely differences between the Mechanical Turk and Morning Consult samples, we will estimate these models with indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge and report these results as well if they differ from those with covariates omitted. RQ2. Correction effects on issue salience and policy views To evaluate RQ2, we will estimate the marginal effect of correction exposure on the importance of crime and respondent policy preferences on the issue for both Clinton and Trump supporters (we will also estimate whether the marginal effects differ between them). As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. (In evaluating RQ2, we may also report a composite measure of crime preferences constructed from a principal components factor analysis if the measures scale together. We may also report an additional model for the post-treatment crime importance measure in which we control for the prior perceived importance of crime using a principal components factor analysis of pre-treatment questions asked about the issue.) RQ3. Correction effects on candidate/politician evaluations To evaluate RQ3, we will estimate the marginal effect of correction exposure on evaluations of Obama, Clinton, and Trump for both Clinton and Trump supporters (we will also estimate whether the marginal effects differ between them). As noted above, these marginal effects will be calculated with respect to the Trump message condition but we will also consider effects with respect to the placebo condition. Additional notes: -We will also compute and report summary statistics for our sample as well as measures of respondent attention and comprehension, including both response timing data and accuracy of answers to manipulation check questions about the treatment articles. -All experimental effect estimates will be unweighted per Franco et al. (N.d.). -The order of hypotheses and analyses in the final manuscript may be altered for expositional clarity. -Note: We may estimate models that include a standard set of demographic covariates (indicators for gender, age groups, race, and political knowledge) if including those demographic measures has a substantively important effect on the precision of our treatment effect estimates. In that case, however, both models would be reported.", "q18": "United States of America", "q19": "~1200 (Morning Consult), ~3000 (Mechanical Turk)", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "",
