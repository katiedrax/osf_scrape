In this project, I will examine the relative importance of election pledge fulfillment to evaluations of government performance and party choice, in comparison to the most commonly used performance criteria: the economy and policy output.

Using a conjoint experiment with unlabelled former government parties, the relative importance of the most important indicators of government performance is estimated in isolation of disturbances found in the real world, but in confrontation with each other.

Based on classic literature on representative democracy (e.g., Dahl, 1991; Downs, 1957) the extent to which government parties fulfill their election pledge should play an important role in how voters evaluate government performance, and their vote choice. In this study, this hypothesis is considered valid if the relative contribution of election pledge fulfillment to the probability of respondents choosing a party profile/or to the evaluation ratings of party profiles is equal to or exceeds that of any of the other included attributes. However, based on different strands of the retrospective voting literature other factors should be more important determinants of evaluations of government performance, and vote choice. According to the economic voting literature, it should be the state or development of the economy that is most important. Either on a societal level (sociotropic), or individual level (egotropic/pocketbook). Thus, an important competing hypothesis is that economic indicators are more important than pledge fulfillment as such. In this study, this hypothesis is considered valid if the relative contribution of both of the economic attributes to the probability of respondents choosing a party profile and to the evaluations rating of party profiles exceeds that of the election pledge fulfillment attribute. According to the wider retrospective voting literature, performance in other policy areas may be equally important (cf. Healy & Malhotra, 2013). Thus, another competing hypothesis is that the favorability of policy output \u2013 either on a societal level, or individual level, is deemed more important than pledge fulfillment as such. In this study, this hypothesis is considered valid if the relative contribution of both of the policy output attributes to the probability of respondents choosing a party profile and to the evaluations rating of party profiles exceeds that of the election pledge fulfillment attribute. I will also examine a potential interaction effect between election pledge fulfillment and individual favorability of policy output. It is to be expected that respondents view the fulfillment of pledges as positive when the produced policy is favored by them; but as negative when the policy is not favored by them (see Naurin et al., 2019)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The experiment consists of a conjoint analysis of combined discrete-choice and ranking tasks that the respondents are confronted with. The basic setup is that respondents are asked to choose between two fictional, unlabelled political parties based on a set of five attributes with randomly assigned values.

In total, 243 unique party profiles are available \u2013 which puts the number of possible combinations of profiles at almost 30,000. As it would be completely unfeasible to have all possible pairs of profiles assessed by at least one respondent, a fractional factorial design was elected. To avoid primacy and ordering effects, the order of the attributes was randomized per respondent. Before the experiment commences, the respondents are shown a screen with a short introduction to the experiment, telling them about the study, what sort of task to expect, and what they should do. On the next screen, respondents are then shown two competing profiles (Party A and Party B) containing randomly-assigned values for these five attributes, per screen. They are then shown three questions that form the dependent variables of this study. First, the respondents are asked which of these two parties they would choose if they had to vote for either. Then, they are asked to evaluate each party\u2019s time in office based on the descriptions provided, on a scale ranging from very bad (1) to very good (7).

Nevertheless, \u201clegality\u201d is often an ambiguous state. Immigration laws are complex and even immigration authorities are often uncertain about immigrants\u2019 statuses (Menj\u00edvar 2006). Given the uncertainty surrounding \u2018illegality,\u2019 how do immigration officers and the public identify individuals they believe to be \u2018illegal\u2019? We posit that people rely on social stereotypes to infer \u2018illegality\u2019. Building off work on the social construction of race (Omi and Winant 1994; Saperstein, Penner and Light 2013), gender (West and Zimmerman 1987), and other social categories (Berger and Luckmann 1966), we develop and test a theoretical model for the social construction of \u2018illegality\u2019. Prior research, which hints at the influence of social class and national origin in shaping perceived illegality, has consisted of qualitative studies of one or two communities. Understanding the attributes that shape public suspicions of illegality is important because individuals perceived to be illegal, regardless of their actual legal status, might experience negative repercussions. Managers or landlords may decide not to hire or rent to them out of fear of breaking the law or because they have strong negative feelings about illegality. Perceived illegality may also increase law enforcement scrutiny. In some jurisdictions, authorities have the power to stop individuals that they suspect of being undocumented (Flores 2017; Menj\u00edvar and Abrego 2012). Officers are not supposed to use race or national origin as indicators of undocumented status. Nevertheless, authorities\u2019 own perceptions may be shaped by ethnic and class-based stereotypes, which could explain why low-income Latin Americans are disproportionately deported (Golash-Boza 2015). Perceived illegality may also help explain why Latinos receive lower call back rates from landlords than non-Hispanic whites or even Asians (Ghoshal and Gaddis 2015) or why they receive worse health care treatment (Asad and Claire 2017) and face more precarious working conditions than other ethnic groups (Ribas 2016). To understand the social construction of \u2018illegality\u2019 and understand its likely consequences, we ask: do individual attributes like national origin, social class, criminal record, and occupation shape perceived undocumented status in the U.S.?

Based on prior literature, we hypothesize that the following characteristics will increase the levels of perceived illegality among our respondents: Latin American national origin, low occupational status, low education level, male, young, few years in the U.S., with a criminal record, and recipient of government services. In addition, we will conduct two interaction tests.

The individual traits are: national origin, occupation, education level, English proficiency, gender, age, years in the U.S., criminal record, and receipt of government benefits.

The TGCC pilot is being implemented in Chipata District, one of eight districts of Zambia\u2019s Eastern Province, from late summer 2014 through the end of 2016. TGCC is a global program created by USAID to explore the relationship between secure resource tenure and the achievement of climate change adaptation and mitigation goals. In Zambia, TGCC will support activities that increase tenure security at the chiefdom, village, and household levels, while also supporting agroforestry extension services, primarily at the village level.

The TGCC interventions that comprise the impact evaluation\u2019s (IE\u2019s) focus are: Agroforestry extension in villages to facilitate tree planting adoption and survivorship on smallholder farms; and A village-level land tenure intervention consisting of participatory mapping, village headperson land administration support, provision of land information and dispute resolution training, including the facilitation of customary land use certificates for households. The primary objective of the IE is to determine whether the village and household land tenure interventions under TGCC strengthen the security of land tenure and resource rights for smallholders, thereby increasing farmer investment in sustainable agroforestry and uptake of other CSA practices.
