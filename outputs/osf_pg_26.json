words matter, especially the words we use to describe a deadly virus. Calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese virus\" is a disturbing example of classical conditioning theory, which was discovered by Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936). Pavlov won a Nobel Prize in 1904 for his research on the role of saliva in digestion, but that is not what he is most famous for. Pavlov was studying digestion in dogs, and he noticed that the dogs started salivating at the mere sight of the food pail. Pavlov tested whether other stimuli (e.g., hearing the sound of a bell) could also be associated with food, and found similar effects. Based on his findings, Pavlov developed classical condition theory.\n\nClassical conditioning theory begins with the premise that an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., food) will produce an unconditioned response (salivation). The neutral stimulus (e.g., the sight of a food pail, sound of a bell) initially does not produce any response. Through repeated pairing, however, the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus, which can produce the same response as the unconditioned stimulus, called a conditioned response.\n\nIn this example, the unconditioned stimulus is the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which produces the unconditioned response of negative feelings (e.g., fear, panic). The neutral stimulus is China. But repeatedly pairing China with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by calling it the \"Chinese virus\" may make China a conditioned stimulus. The net result is that calling coronavirus disease (COVID-19) the \"Chinese virus\" can produce negative feelings toward people from China and other East Asian countries.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-17T02:37:41.641819", "date_modified": "2020-04-16T15:37:57.053481", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Lanier Holt", "Brad Bushman", "Sophie Kjaervik"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "31ad0ba2c74a655883433c800fa55a597125bb4df218f88a6d6e36d1801f434fb495dd02ad2501ca50a57195d2f96ca35604255d2acef702cb28aadbe86e13c54da5abb7dc3bd5d3db85ee6a693071f086640b2b70714f260f8eb4ca5b3cf71775c4d61bcbb89d9106f3cdf911caf88bda17d40fb210f4755b4208e4e003947e280a430f8415ab451d24382f4f977104", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-17T02:37:41.616718", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Brad J.

The Anti-Asian Stereotype scale will be used to measure participants\u2019 attitudes regarding stereotypes about Asian people (Lin, Kwan, Cheung, &amp; Fiske, 2005).\n4. The Attitudes Towards Asians Scale will be used to measure attitudes about Asian people (Ho &amp; Jackson, 2001)\n5.

I will be conducting a secondary data analysis of approximately 200 healthy aging individuals, whose data was made available by the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center at the University of Kansas Medical Center. The goal of my thesis is to examine the relationship between neuroimaging and behavioral measures of these inhibition networks. My secondary focus will be to examine how this relates to aging among an aging population. I expect to bridge the gap in literature regarding inhibition and healthy aging. The inhibition deficit hypothesis states that, \u201colder adults are less able to suppress or ignore irrelevant thoughts and actions than young adults are\u201d (Rey-Mermet &amp; Gade, 2017). However, results from studies have revealed mixed results, with a meta-analysis by Rey-Mermet and Gade (2017) questioning the generalizability of the hypothesis.

There is a difference, however, between the will to provide a better future and the belief that one can. The theory of the revolutionary mentality argues that throughout history there is a clearly identifiable and continuous state of mind present in some individuals called the revolutionary mentality, in which one finds oneself apt to reshape society by political means (de Carvalho, 2007). As such, the individuals with this mentality find themselves as the carrier of the better future, representing ideals that are above any judgement by those who do not hold them. The result of this state of mind is a series of mental inversions, being the one addressed in this research the inversion of morality. This specific inversion refers to the idea that means justify the ends, that is, if one finds oneself apt of achieving the utopian future, every measure taken for it is automatically justified as being good in nature. The hypothesis that being a change activist is positively correlated with anger comes from the predictions of the revolutionary mentality theory, that is, anger is a psychological state clearly related to immorality and change activists face much higher states of revolutionary mentality. The second hypothesis - that social influencers and organizations will be negatively correlated to anger - originated from the notion that when one has a lot of influence, it is common for one to hide negative aspects. For example, politicians and NGO's representatives will show their negative side on public less than an \"unknown\" person would.

There is a difference, however, between the will to provide a better future and the belief that one can. The theory of the revolutionary mentality argues that throughout history there is a clearly identifiable and continuous state of mind present in some individuals called the revolutionary mentality, in which one finds oneself apt to reshape society by political means (de Carvalho, 2007). As such, the individuals with this mentality find themselves as the carrier of the better future, representing ideals that are above any judgement by those who do not hold them. The result of this state of mind is a series of mental inversions, being the one addressed in this research the inversion of morality. This specific inversion refers to the idea that means justify the ends, that is, if one finds oneself apt of achieving the utopian future, every measure taken for it is automatically justified as being good in nature. The hypothesis that being a change activist is positively correlated with anger comes from the predictions of the revolutionary mentality theory, that is, anger is a psychological state clearly related to immorality and change activists face much higher states of revolutionary mentality. The second hypothesis - that social influencers and organizations will be negatively correlated to anger - originated from the notion that when one has a lot of influence, it is common for one to hide negative aspects. For example, politicians and NGO's representatives will show their negative side on public less than an \"unknown\" person would.
