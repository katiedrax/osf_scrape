The acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will result in increased stress and lower mood\n\nacute phase of the COVID-19 crisis - the crisis surrounding the acute phase of the COVID-19 virus outbreak will act as a naturalistic stressor (Time 1). We define the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis as the period (March and April 2020 in Austria) during which there are government restrictions on:\n\n- people\u2019s ability to leave their homes and interact with people who do not live in their household. In Austria, people are only allowed to leave their homes for the following reasons: to buy food or other essentials (e.g. medicines), help someone, exercise either alone or with people who live in the same household, or to work if it is not possible to work from home. People are also required to keep at least 1 metre between themselves and others when in public (social distancing). \n\n- the opening of workplaces, places of learning (e.g. kindergartens, schools, universities), shops, restaurants, public spaces, sportsgrounds, and playgrounds. During the study period in Austria all but essential shops and services (e.g. supermarkets, healthcare services) are closed (except for the period April 14 onwards when some shops, e.g. those under 400 m2 were allowed to reopen, but under tight regulations).\n\nWe will use a (partial) repeated measures design whereby we will ask the same participants to take part in the study again once the crisis is over (Time 2). We aim for this to be in 12 months when there are no longer the above outlined government restrictions. For example, people can leave their homes, work, study and interact with others as before the crisis. Those participants who took part at Time 1 but who do not take part at Time 2 will be replaced by similar participants to ensure comparable sample sizes. We will ensure that both samples are matched on key demographic variables, such as age, gender, nationality, country of residence, people in the household, and working status (see Appendix 1). \n\n\n1B. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the presence of psychiatric symptoms and loneliness\n\n- screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, eating disorder, and alcoholism - modified versions of Patient Health Questionnaire (Spitzer, Kroenke &amp; Williams, 1999) and Structured clinical interview (Wittchen et al., 1997)\n\n- perceived stress - perceived stress scale (Klein et. al., 2016; 10 items)\n\n- loneliness - UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russel, Peplau &amp; Cutrona, 1980; 20 items)\n\n\n1C. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the people\u2019s attitudes towards the crisis\n\n- risk of infection for self \u2013 participants are asked about the probability that you will be infected with the virus within the next two months (VAS definitely not \u2013 definitely)\n\n- risk of infection for close other \u2013 participants are asked about the probability that a person close to them (e.g. partner, child, parent, good friend) will be infected with the virus within the next two months (VAS definitely not \u2013 definitely)\n\n- health risk for self \u2013 participants will be asked whether they agree with the statement \u201cI am concerned about the effects of the virus on my health.\u201d (VAS Slider: do not agree at all, strongly agree)\n\n- health risk for close others \u2013 participants will be asked whether they agree with the statement \u2013 \u201cI am concerned about the impact of the virus on the health of the most important people in my life.

Increased stress and lower mood will be related to increased \u201cwanting\u201d and increased consumption of rewards\n\n- reward consumption \u2013 at each EMA participants will be asked to indicate which rewards they have consumed since the last assessment (or since waking if it is the first assessment of the day), such as salty or fatty foods, alcohol, and cigarettes (see Appendix 1 for the full list of the rewards).\n\n- \u201cwanting\u201d - at each EMA, participants will be asked to indicate on a VAS how much they desire to consume the rewards at that moment (see Appendix 1 for the full list of rewards)\n\n\n2B. Increased stress and lower mood will not be related to changes in the \u201cliking\u201d of rewards\n\n- reward \u201cliking\u201d \u2013 if participants indicate that they consumed a reward (e.g. fatty or salty food, alcohol, cigarettes, etc.) during an EMA, for each reward they must indicate how much they enjoyed this reward on a VAS from 0 to 100.\n\n\n2C The relationship between stress and mood and the consumption of rewards will be modulated by the frequency and nature of social exchanges during the crisis\n\nSee 2A and 4A \n\n***************\n\n(3) Stress, mood, and music listening\n\n3A. Music listening will be related to reduced stress and increased mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nmusic listening \u2013 at each EMA participants must indicate whether they are currently listening to music (yes/no) or if they have listening to music since the last EMA (or since getting up if it is the first entry of the day)\n\n\n3B. Musical and situational factors will modulate the relationship between music listening and mood and stress\n\n- Liking of music listening - VAS\n- Valence of the music - VAS (sad - happy) \n- Arousal of the music - VAS (calming \u2013 energising)\n- Main reason for listening to the music: Relaxation / Activation / Distraction / Against boredom / Other reason\n\n***************\n\n(4) Stress, mood, and social interactions\n\n4A. The frequency and nature of social exchanges will be bidirectionally related to reduced stress and improved mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\n- Frequency of social exchanges \u2013 at each EMA participants will be asked to indicate the number of social exchanges (of more than 2 minutes) they had since the last EMA (or since waking up)\n\n- Frequency of face-to-face social exchanges \u2013 participants will be asked to indicate how many of these social exchanges were in person (\u201cface-to-face\u201d)\n\n- Nature of social exchanges \u2013 at each EMA participants will be asked to think about their last social exchange and asked to indicate:\n          - the number of people in the exchange (2 people / more than 2 people)\n          - who this was with (e.g. partner, child, parent, friend)\n          - how close they are to this person (VAS: not close at all  - very close)\n          - how pleasant the exchange was (VAS: not pleasant at all - very pleasant)\n          - how long is was (e.g. &lt; 5 mins, 5-20 mins, 21-45 mins, &gt; 45 mins)\n          - how they communicated (in person, voice call, video call, text-based)\n\n\n4B. The relationship between stress and mood and social exchanges will be modulated by how much people enjoy socialising and social interactions\n\nThe extent to which people enjoy socialising and enjoy social interactions will be measured using the Sociability and Prosocial Interactions subscales from the Social Reward Questionnaire (Foukles et al., 2014) \n\n***************\n\n(5) Stress, mood, and prosocial behaviour\n\n\n5A. Stress and mood will be related to changes in prosocial behaviour\n\n- prosocial behaviour \u2013 at each EMA participants will be asked whether they supported or helped someone since the last assessment and whether this person lives in their household or not\n\n\n5B. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by trait prosocialness\n\n- prosocialness will be measured with the Prosocial Scale (Caprara et al., 2005)\n\n\n5C. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by effort\n\n- effort \u2013 at each EMA if participants reported helping behaviour, they will be asked to indicate how much effort was involved (VAS none - very much)"}, "question3b": {"extra": [], "value": "outlined above"}}}, "procedure": {"value": {"question10b": {"extra": [], "value": "We will implement a repeated measures design using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach.

The acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will result in increased stress and lower mood\n\nDuring the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis people are facing many well-established stressors (Holmes and Rahe, 1967), such as concerns about their own health and the health of family members, disruptions to their employment status and family life, and feelings of uncontrollability and uncertainty about the future. We predict the crisis (and the associated restrictions) will result in lower mood and increased stress, as measured by self report and hair cortisol, compared to at follow up when the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis is over. \n\n1B. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the presence of psychiatric symptoms and loneliness\n\nWe predict that individuals who score high on loneliness and who display symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g. chronic stress, depression, anxiety) will be more affected by the crisis in terms of their stress and mood. \n\n1C. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the people\u2019s attitudes towards the crisis\n\nWe predict that people\u2019s perceptions of (1) the risk of infection to themselves, (2) the risk of infection to close others, and, the (3) health, (4) financial, and (5) social consequences of the crisis, will modulate the impact of the crisis on mood and stress. \n\n1D. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by demographic information\n\nWe will conduct an exploratory analysis to determine which demographic information (e.g. age, gender, physical and mental health status, number of people in household, country of residence, working situation, socioeconomic status) can best predict those individuals whose stress and mood are most affected by the crisis.\n\n***************\n\n(2) Stress, mood, and reward seeking \n\n2A. Increased stress and lower mood will be related to increased \u201cwanting\u201d and increased consumption of rewards\n\nStress results in increased activity in the brain\u2019s dopaminergic \u201creward system\u201d making rewards more salient (Pruessner et al., 2004). We predict that this will result in increased \u201cwanting\u201d (incentive salience) of rewards, such as high caloric foods, alcohol and other drugs, and will result in those participants reporting more stress also reporting greater reward consumption. \n\n2B. Increased stress and lower mood will not be related to changes in the \u201cliking\u201d of rewards\n\nEnjoyment (or \u201cliking\u201d) of rewards is mediated by the opioid system and is independent from the \u201cwanting\u201d system, which is mainly controlled by the dopaminergic transmission (Lemmens et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been shown that stress induces an increase in \u201cwanting\u201d of rewards, which is not followed by a higher pleasurable sensation (Pool et al., 2015). Thus, \u201cliking\u201d (hedonic aspect) of the reward will not be linked to increased stress.\n\n2C The relationship between stress and mood and the consumption of rewards will be modulated by the frequency and nature of social exchanges during the crisis\n\nThe frequency and nature of social exchanges will modulate the bidirectional relationship between reward consumption and stress. While rewards in general could temporarily relieve stress created by social deprivation, social exchanges can address an underlying unmet need (Matthews &amp; Tye, 2019) and thus \u201cbuffer\u201d the effects of stress on consumption of other rewards. We further expect that the size of this effect will depend on the medium (face-to-face, video/audio call or texting) and the valence of the social exchanges. \n\n***************\n\n(3) Stress, mood, and music listening\n\n3A. Music listening will be related to reduced stress and increased mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nWe predict that music listening will be related to increased mood (valence, calmness, energetic arousal) and reduced stress levels (Groarke &amp; Hogan, 2019; Helsing et al., 2016; Linnemann et al., 2015). During the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis there will be reduced access to other forms of stress regulation (e.g. social support, outdoor activities) so the relationship between music listening and reduced stress and increased mood will be stronger during this period than at follow up when the crisis is over.\n\n3B. Musical and situational factors will modulate the relationship between music listening and mood and stress\n\nPersonal, musical, and situational factors should be considered when examining the health benefits of music (Juslin et al., 2008; Linnemann et al., 2018; Linnemann et al., 2015; Randall &amp; Rickard, 2017). We predict that musical factors (valence, arousal) and situational factors (reasons for music listening, duration of music listening, liking of music listening) will modulate the relationship between music listening and mood and stress.\n\n***************\n\n(4) Stress, mood, and social interactions\n\n4A. The frequency and nature of social exchanges will be bidirectionally related to reduced stress and improved mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nSocial contact and social support have been shown to buffer the effects of adverse events on stress and mood (Lin, Dean &amp; Ensel, 2013). We predict that more frequent social exchanges will be bidirectionally related to reduced stress and improved mood. Second, we predict that the nature of these social exchanges, such as their medium (e.g. face-to-face, audio, text; Dunbar, 2012), valence (positive, negative), and who they were with (e.g. family, stranger), will also be bidirectionally related to stress and mood. We predict that during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis the relationship between social exchanges and altered stress and mood will be stronger than at follow up, as during the corona-crisis many people\u2019s opportunities for social interaction will be limited or disrupted. Thus, the stress buffering effects of social interactions will be stronger.\n\n4B. The relationship between stress and mood and social exchanges will be modulated by how much people enjoy socialising and social interactions\n\nThe relationship between stress and mood and social exchanges will be modulated by how much people enjoy socialising (e.g. spending time with others, going to parties) and having kind, reciprocal relationships (Foukles et al., 2014). That is, the stress buffering effects of social exchanges will be strongest in those who find social interaction and socialising more rewarding. \n\n***************\n\n(5) Stress, mood, and prosocial behaviour\n\n5A. Stress and mood will be related to changes in prosocial behaviour\n\nFor this hypothesis we will pit two theories against each other. The \u201cfight or flight\u201d hypothesis argues that stress can lead to an increased urge to self-preserve resulting in reduced prosocial behaviour (Mawson, 2005). Whereas, the \u201ctend and befriend\u201d hypothesis argues that stress can have prosocial consequences (e.g. increased helping) and this increased prosociality reduces individuals\u2019 own stress and improves their mood (Taylor et al., 2000) - thus, the relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour is bidirectional. Both extremes in prosociality have been reported in the media during the crisis (e.g. \u201cpanic buying\u201d vs. helping elderly neighbours).\n\n5B. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by trait prosocialness\n\nPeople\u2019s reactions towards others during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will vary. One explanation for this could be that stress precipitates habitual behaviours (Schwabe and Wolf, 2009). We predict that individuals who score high on trait prosocialness (Caprara et al., 2005), for whom prosocial behaviour is a \u201cdefault\u201d, will show an increase in prosocial behaviour when stressed.\n\n5C. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by effort\n\nPrevious studies have shown that stress can lead to increased prosociality, such as more sharing with others (van Dawans et al., 2012). However, in such studies, participants did not need to exert any significant effort to help another person. Prosocial behaviour reduces when we need to exert significant effort to help others (Lockwood et al., 2017). We predict that, if stress and mood changes lead to increased prosocial behaviour, this will only hold for behaviour associated with low effort.\n\n\n******************************************\n\nExploratory analyses\n\nWe also pursue several exploratory questions:\n\n(1) The Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (IOS; Aron et. al., 1992) will measure how connected participants feel to the person they feel closest to and whether this person lives in the same household as them. We aim to investigate, whether:\n- there are differences in how connected participants feel towards this person during and after the crisis\n- this feeling is modulated by different levels of proximity (e.g., same household during the self-isolation, same household without self-isolation, not the same household) \n- certain individual differences measures can predict these outcomes \n\n(2) With the Inclusion of Community in the Self Scale (ICS; Mashek et al., 2007) we want to investigate the fluidity of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cthe community\u201d-connectedness during and after the crisis. For example, do participants will feel more connected to the worldwide population during the crisis compared to after?

We will collect EMA data until the end of April 2020. ", "description-hypothesis.question1a": "All hypotheses are confirmatory unless stated otherwise.\n\n***************\n\n(1) Stress, mood and the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\n1A. The acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will result in increased stress and lower mood\n\nDuring the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis people are facing many well-established stressors (Holmes and Rahe, 1967), such as concerns about their own health and the health of family members, disruptions to their employment status and family life, and feelings of uncontrollability and uncertainty about the future. We predict the crisis (and the associated restrictions) will result in lower mood and increased stress, as measured by self report and hair cortisol, compared to at follow up when the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis is over. \n\n1B. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the presence of psychiatric symptoms and loneliness\n\nWe predict that individuals who score high on loneliness and who display symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g. chronic stress, depression, anxiety) will be more affected by the crisis in terms of their stress and mood. \n\n1C. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by the people\u2019s attitudes towards the crisis\n\nWe predict that people\u2019s perceptions of (1) the risk of infection to themselves, (2) the risk of infection to close others, and, the (3) health, (4) financial, and (5) social consequences of the crisis, will modulate the impact of the crisis on mood and stress. \n\n1D. The effect of the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis on stress and mood will be modulated by demographic information\n\nWe will conduct an exploratory analysis to determine which demographic information (e.g. age, gender, physical and mental health status, number of people in household, country of residence, working situation, socioeconomic status) can best predict those individuals whose stress and mood are most affected by the crisis.\n\n***************\n\n(2) Stress, mood, and reward seeking \n\n2A. Increased stress and lower mood will be related to increased \u201cwanting\u201d and increased consumption of rewards\n\nStress results in increased activity in the brain\u2019s dopaminergic \u201creward system\u201d making rewards more salient (Pruessner et al., 2004). We predict that this will result in increased \u201cwanting\u201d (incentive salience) of rewards, such as high caloric foods, alcohol and other drugs, and will result in those participants reporting more stress also reporting greater reward consumption. \n\n2B. Increased stress and lower mood will not be related to changes in the \u201cliking\u201d of rewards\n\nEnjoyment (or \u201cliking\u201d) of rewards is mediated by the opioid system and is independent from the \u201cwanting\u201d system, which is mainly controlled by the dopaminergic transmission (Lemmens et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been shown that stress induces an increase in \u201cwanting\u201d of rewards, which is not followed by a higher pleasurable sensation (Pool et al., 2015). Thus, \u201cliking\u201d (hedonic aspect) of the reward will not be linked to increased stress.\n\n2C The relationship between stress and mood and the consumption of rewards will be modulated by the frequency and nature of social exchanges during the crisis\n\nThe frequency and nature of social exchanges will modulate the bidirectional relationship between reward consumption and stress. While rewards in general could temporarily relieve stress created by social deprivation, social exchanges can address an underlying unmet need (Matthews &amp; Tye, 2019) and thus \u201cbuffer\u201d the effects of stress on consumption of other rewards. We further expect that the size of this effect will depend on the medium (face-to-face, video/audio call or texting) and the valence of the social exchanges. \n\n***************\n\n(3) Stress, mood, and music listening\n\n3A. Music listening will be related to reduced stress and increased mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nWe predict that music listening will be related to increased mood (valence, calmness, energetic arousal) and reduced stress levels (Groarke &amp; Hogan, 2019; Helsing et al., 2016; Linnemann et al., 2015). During the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis there will be reduced access to other forms of stress regulation (e.g. social support, outdoor activities) so the relationship between music listening and reduced stress and increased mood will be stronger during this period than at follow up when the crisis is over.\n\n3B. Musical and situational factors will modulate the relationship between music listening and mood and stress\n\nPersonal, musical, and situational factors should be considered when examining the health benefits of music (Juslin et al., 2008; Linnemann et al., 2018; Linnemann et al., 2015; Randall &amp; Rickard, 2017). We predict that musical factors (valence, arousal) and situational factors (reasons for music listening, duration of music listening, liking of music listening) will modulate the relationship between music listening and mood and stress.\n\n***************\n\n(4) Stress, mood, and social interactions\n\n4A. The frequency and nature of social exchanges will be bidirectionally related to reduced stress and improved mood and this relationship will be more pronounced during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis\n\nSocial contact and social support have been shown to buffer the effects of adverse events on stress and mood (Lin, Dean &amp; Ensel, 2013). We predict that more frequent social exchanges will be bidirectionally related to reduced stress and improved mood. Second, we predict that the nature of these social exchanges, such as their medium (e.g. face-to-face, audio, text; Dunbar, 2012), valence (positive, negative), and who they were with (e.g. family, stranger), will also be bidirectionally related to stress and mood. We predict that during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis the relationship between social exchanges and altered stress and mood will be stronger than at follow up, as during the corona-crisis many people\u2019s opportunities for social interaction will be limited or disrupted. Thus, the stress buffering effects of social interactions will be stronger.\n\n4B. The relationship between stress and mood and social exchanges will be modulated by how much people enjoy socialising and social interactions\n\nThe relationship between stress and mood and social exchanges will be modulated by how much people enjoy socialising (e.g. spending time with others, going to parties) and having kind, reciprocal relationships (Foukles et al., 2014). That is, the stress buffering effects of social exchanges will be strongest in those who find social interaction and socialising more rewarding. \n\n***************\n\n(5) Stress, mood, and prosocial behaviour\n\n5A. Stress and mood will be related to changes in prosocial behaviour\n\nFor this hypothesis we will pit two theories against each other. The \u201cfight or flight\u201d hypothesis argues that stress can lead to an increased urge to self-preserve resulting in reduced prosocial behaviour (Mawson, 2005). Whereas, the \u201ctend and befriend\u201d hypothesis argues that stress can have prosocial consequences (e.g. increased helping) and this increased prosociality reduces individuals\u2019 own stress and improves their mood (Taylor et al., 2000) - thus, the relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour is bidirectional. Both extremes in prosociality have been reported in the media during the crisis (e.g. \u201cpanic buying\u201d vs. helping elderly neighbours).\n\n5B. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by trait prosocialness\n\nPeople\u2019s reactions towards others during the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will vary. One explanation for this could be that stress precipitates habitual behaviours (Schwabe and Wolf, 2009). We predict that individuals who score high on trait prosocialness (Caprara et al., 2005), for whom prosocial behaviour is a \u201cdefault\u201d, will show an increase in prosocial behaviour when stressed.\n\n5C. The relationship between stress and mood and prosocial behaviour will be modulated by effort\n\nPrevious studies have shown that stress can lead to increased prosociality, such as more sharing with others (van Dawans et al., 2012). However, in such studies, participants did not need to exert any significant effort to help another person. Prosocial behaviour reduces when we need to exert significant effort to help others (Lockwood et al., 2017). We predict that, if stress and mood changes lead to increased prosocial behaviour, this will only hold for behaviour associated with low effort.\n\n\n******************************************\n\nExploratory analyses\n\nWe also pursue several exploratory questions:\n\n(1) The Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale (IOS; Aron et. al., 1992) will measure how connected participants feel to the person they feel closest to and whether this person lives in the same household as them. We aim to investigate, whether:\n- there are differences in how connected participants feel towards this person during and after the crisis\n- this feeling is modulated by different levels of proximity (e.g., same household during the self-isolation, same household without self-isolation, not the same household) \n- certain individual differences measures can predict these outcomes \n\n(2) With the Inclusion of Community in the Self Scale (ICS; Mashek et al., 2007) we want to investigate the fluidity of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cthe community\u201d-connectedness during and after the crisis. For example, do participants will feel more connected to the worldwide population during the crisis compared to after? We will conduct an exploratory analysis to investigate which factors predict ICS scores.\n\n(3) Following the EMA period participants will complete a post-monitoring questionnaire, which asks participants how they coped with the study and any difficulties they encountered. As we are conducting a large EMA study, we will conduct an exploratory analysis to see whether demographic information is related to difficulties associated with the completion of the EMA. \n\n(4) We will conduct an exploratory analysis to investigate the relationship between the size of participants\u2019 social networks (i.e. the number of friends they report having; see Appendix 2) and their stress and mood during and after the crisis. \n\n\n", "description-hypothesis.question2a": "outlined above", "description-hypothesis.question3a": "The acute phase of the COVID-19 virus outbreak will act as a naturalistic stressor.

In addition, we will measure hair cortisol from a subset of at least 80 participants (or more depending on availability) in order to collect a biological marker of chronic stress (Stalder &amp; Kirschbaum, 2012). Participants will be instructed to cut several thin strands of  hair near the scalp from the posterior vertex region and send them to our lab. Due to the growth rate of 1 cm per month, we will be able to analyse accumulated hair cortisol for the time period during as well as before the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, respectively. Hair cortisol will also be collected at follow-up, representing chronic biological stress after termination of the acute crisis. \n\n- mood \u2013 this will be measured using a validated measure of mood for EMA studies (Wilhelm &amp; Schoebi, 2007).

The acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis will result in increased stress and lower mood\n\nacute phase of the COVID-19 crisis - the crisis surrounding the acute phase of the COVID-19 virus outbreak will act as a naturalistic stressor (Time 1). We define the acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis as the period (March and April 2020 in Austria) during which there are government restrictions on:\n\n- people\u2019s ability to leave their homes and interact with people who do not live in their household. In Austria, people are only allowed to leave their homes for the following reasons: to buy food or other essentials (e.g. medicines), help someone, exercise either alone or with people who live in the same household, or to work if it is not possible to work from home. People are also required to keep at least 1 metre between themselves and others when in public (social distancing). \n\n- the opening of workplaces, places of learning (e.g. kindergartens, schools, universities), shops, restaurants, public spaces, sportsgrounds, and playgrounds. During the study period in Austria all but essential shops and services (e.g. supermarkets, healthcare services) are closed (except for the period April 14 onwards when some shops, e.g. those under 400 m2 were allowed to reopen, but under tight regulations).\n\nWe will use a (partial) repeated measures design whereby we will ask the same participants to take part in the study again once the crisis is over (Time 2). We aim for this to be in 12 months when there are no longer the above outlined government restrictions. For example, people can leave their homes, work, study and interact with others as before the crisis. Those participants who took part at Time 1 but who do not take part at Time 2 will be replaced by similar participants to ensure comparable sample sizes. We will ensure that both samples are matched on key demographic variables, such as age, gender, nationality, country of residence, people in the household, and working status (see Appendix 1). \n\n\n1B.
