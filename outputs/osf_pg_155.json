Berger, Anna Solmeyer, Muizz Alaradi, Weston Merrick, Mikaela Binsfeld, Benjamin Nguyen, Ian Williamson"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "The late 1990s saw an increase in the number of healthcare providers prescribing opioid pain relievers, as well as an increase in the number of pills that were prescribed. This culminated in the early 2010s, when the opioid prescribing rate in the United States reached 81.2 prescriptions per 100 people (1). With numerous opioid pain relievers available, opioid overdose rates began spiking across the United States. In 2016, 11.5 million Americans ages 12 or older reported misusing prescription opioids (2). By 2017, 68% of drug overdose deaths involved opioids (3). \n\nIn recent years there have been a number of federal and state policy responses to the opioid abuse crisis. Federal responses have included increasing access to addiction treatment, ensuring overdose-reversing drugs are available to high-risk populations, strengthening public health data reporting and collection, supporting research to understand the problem and find solutions, and advancing pain management and evidence-based pain care (7). The federal government has also streamlined the efforts of several agencies to coordinate responses and address priority areas (8). Strategies include expanded access to naloxone and allowing qualified primary care practitioners, who obtain a waiver, to provide medication-assisted treatment for up to 275 patients (9). \n\nWithin this broader national response, states have begun to implement their own plans and programs to address problematic opioid use and opioid harm within their communities. State-level responses are uniquely important because they are better able to target regional and cultural contributors to community crises. State-responses can be less one-size-fits-all than federal policies, and thus may more effectively address the opioid crisis for citizens of that state. In addition to greater policy specificity, states can encourage social change through the passage of policies, independent of the specific actions of the policies. Because citizens are more directly affected by state-level policies and programs, the passage of policies at the state level provides a signal to the community about the state\u2019s priorities and changes to its social environment. The adoption of a program may encourage changes in community behavior before the program is even initiated as citizens of the state respond to the perceived shift in state priorities. \n\nProminent examples of state-level approaches that have been shown to impact opioid abuse and harm include provisions for Good Samaritan immunity (10), increased availability of rescue drugs, healthcare provider training, and licensing and regulation of pain management facilities (11). Of the variety of state policy responses, two common approaches have focused on moderating opioid prescribing in order to address problems specifically related to prescription opioid drugs (12). \n\nThe earliest state policy responses aimed at moderating opioid prescribing established enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to track prescribing behavior and prescription utilization trends. PDMPs gather electronic information about a patient's history of prescriptions, and potential for misuse, from prescribers and pharmaceutical dispensaries when a prescription is issued. While the utility and impact of PDMPs should not be understated, most state PDMPs were established before the scope and importance of the national opioid crisis was evident. However, many states made an array of changes, including tightening up requirements around use before prescribing, requiring course treatments, and expanding the contexts under which the PDMP must be used. Establishment of PDMPs has been associated with a reduction in opioid poisoning and healthcare admissions for opioid-related treatment (13). States with strict PDMP utilization requirements (specifically, those that have a mandatory requirement that physicians check before issuing at least some opioid prescriptions) have also seen a reduction in opioid prescribing (14). \n\nA second approach directly targeting prescription opioids is the adoption of regulatory limits on opioid prescribing. The Centers for Disease Control's 2016 Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain noted that long-term use often begins with treating acute pain, but a three- to seven-day supply is usually enough for severe pain (15). Shortly after the release of these guidelines, Massachusetts became the first state to adopt a seven-day statutory limit on initial opioid prescriptions (16). At least 33 states enacted legislative opioid prescribing limits, including both limits on all first-time opioid prescriptions and limits affecting only certain prescriptions (e.g., prescriptions for dental or ophthalmologic pain), by October 2018 (17). \n\nPrescribing limits provide an important opportunity to understand the impact of state-level signaling of a crisis response through the implementation of legislation. Because of broad public awareness of the opioid crisis by 2016, state-level adoption of prescribing limits had a greater potential for public visibility than typical state legislation. These policies also specifically targeted the prescription opioid crisis, and thus provided a concrete signal of a state\u2019s intent to change problematic prescribing behavior. Finally, because these policies were implemented at the state level (and not all states have implemented such policies) there is an opportunity to understand how the signaling of a state-level response to a national problem impacts the residents of those states. \n\nThe purpose of this evaluation is to estimate the causal effect of the passage of state-level opioid monitoring programs (i.e., prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use) and prescription limiting legislation on the volume of prescribing for opioid drugs and the rate of fatal opioid poisonings. This evaluation will provide policy makers with an understanding of national trends in opioid prescribing, opioid-related death rates, and the role that state legislation has played in shaping those trends. \n\nPrimary Research Question: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level Medicaid opioid prescription rate, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nSecondary Research Question 1: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level drug poisoning death rate for prescription opioids, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nSecondary Research Question 2: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level drug poisoning death rate for all types of opioids, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nExploratory Research Questions: We will examine several potential moderators of the association between legislative action and prescription rates and drug poisoning deaths due to opioids. These include: the state\u2019s baseline rate of Medicaid opioid prescribing, the state\u2019s baseline rate of drug poisoning deaths due to opioids, and the state\u2019s demographic characteristics."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1: In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level Medicaid will tend towards lower prescribing rates, compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n\nHypothesis 2: In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level opioid drug-poisoning death rates (due to prescription opioids) will tend towards lower death rates, compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n\nHypothesis 3:  In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level opioid drug-poisoning death rates (due to all types of opioids) will tend towards lower death rates compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

No states adopted PDMP laws requiring physicians to review PDMP records before Nevada, in 2007. Massachusetts passed the first opioid prescribing limits in 2016. Many states adopted similar policies following these states' lead. \n\nThe identification strategy is a generalized difference-in-differences approach, using event study methodology, that includes a linear two-way (state and time period) fixed effects regression with leads and lags of treatment (18). We will estimate the time-varying effect of adopting each policy during the year of adoption, and one, two, and three or more years after adoption. Levels of opioid prescribing and drug poisoning death rates in each state at each time period will be compared to outcomes in other states that either had not yet adopted similar policies or did not adopt similar policies before the end of the study period. As of the fall of 2019, six states have adopted neither a prescriber mandate for PDMP use nor statutory prescription limits. As recently as the beginning of 2017, seventeen states had not adopted either policy. Categorical state, year, and (when appropriate) quarter fixed effects, as well as fixed effects for state-level time-varying confounders including both annual demographic and economic characteristics, and state-level policies such as marijuana liberalization and Medicaid expansion, will be used to control for fixed and time-varying confounding effects. \n\nThe event study specification makes three essential assumptions (19) that must be satisfied for causal effect identification: \n\n1. Parallel baseline trends are independent of exposure status. In counterfactual notation, the conditional exchangeability assumption can be written as Ya\u2aebA|L, which is to say that the outcome a state would have experienced (Y), at any given time with any given combination of state opioid policies (a), is independent (\u2aeb) of the actual set of state opioid policies that the state had at that time (A), given the identified confounding variables (L). This assumption is untestable in any difference-in-difference analysis, because states are not randomized to receive the policies. However, the absence of pre-policy differential trends lends support to the assumption that post-policy trends would have been parallel if the policies had not been adopted. \n\n2. No anticipatory behavior prior to treatment. This is an extension of the parallel trends assumption. It holds that for all lead periods l&lt;0, the effect of approaching treatment \u03bc_l is 0. This is most plausible for random (exogenous) exposures. While it is reasonable to assume that prescribers and/or opioid users would not change their behavior in anticipation of upcoming legislation, it would not be unreasonable for states with worsening opioid-related outcomes to adopt more stringent controls. Either reason for pre-trends would bias estimated effects. We did not find evidence of differential trends in policy adopting states in the years prior to policy adoption. \n\n3. Treatment effect homogeneity. For each \"cohort\" of policy implementations, the effect \u03bc_l of being in a relative timing lag period l\u22650 is homogeneous regardless of absolute timing t. This assumption can only be tested in the final analysis. The presence of heterogeneous treatment effects does not invalidate results, but rather results in a weighted average of time-varying treatment effects. Several important differences exist between state-years with policies and state-years without policies (see Figure 1 for a Directed Acyclic Graph displaying these variables). As an impact evaluation seeking to estimate the causal effect of state opioid policies on opioid prescribing and opioid-related deaths, this evaluation depends on an assumption of conditional exchangeability between states that did, and did not, adopt opioid policies of interest. According to this assumption, no unmeasured confounding variables are directly associated with state opioid policies and the outcome of interest, conditional on the measured confounding variables. \n\nSeveral unmeasured time-invariant characteristics of each state (labeled \"V\" in Figure 1) may be linked to the outcome after policy change. For example, each state has a fixed baseline rate of the outcome that is associated with the outcome at any follow-up time. We include state fixed effects to account for these characteristics.\n\nWithin states, changes in the age structure of the population, the racial/ethnic composition of the population, the prevailing unemployment rate and employment in the manufacturing sector, and the passage of other relevant laws, such as marijuana liberalization, Medicaid expansion, and opioid-related policies such as Good Samaritan laws and naloxone access laws, may be associated both with the adoption of relevant policies and with either prescriber behavior or the risk of opioid-related mortality. \n\nFinally, national trends across time (labeled \"U\" in Figure 1), such as changing levels of opioid prescribing and mortality may also be linked to the outcome after policy change. We include year fixed effects to account for these national trends. Because national trends are not neatly summarized with a linear or quadratic trend, we will include a categorical year fixed effect.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Figure 1.

Further, our research questions (as stated above) are focused on the impact of individual state policies within the states that enacted them. As such, the study population is fixed and adjustments to study sample sizes to improve statistical power are not possible. However, it is still informative to understand the expected power of the study as it is implemented, as this provides context for interpreting results regardless of statistical significance. Additionally, a power analysis provides an illustration of the minimum detectable effects (MDE) within each study period of interest to our work."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "We performed our power analysis via simulation using the \u201csimstudy\u201d (27) package in R to generate artificial data from estimates of the population distribution around the parameters to be fit by our event study model. We used these estimates to simulate realistic variance around the parameters of a data generating function (in this case our statistical model), introduced a defined policy effect to a particular event period, and then used our model to test for the presence of the effect. For each introduced effect, we simulated 1000 possible experiments, drawing data from the estimated distributions, and calculated power as the proportion of those simulations where effects were correctly detected.\n\nOur study is concerned with the change in opioid-related outcomes after states enact legislation targeting the opioid problem. We therefore used the data collected in our study for the event periods prior to the policy event to estimate the expected means and variances (in absence of a policy effect) after the policy was enacted. The implicit assumption made by this approach is that event periods after the policy has been enacted will only differ from periods before the policy is enacted if there is a policy effect. Introduced effects were standardized and scaled between -0.6 to 0.6 (i.e., making no assumptions about effect direction). \n\nTo provide the most parsimonious and interpretable estimate of a minimum detectable effect, we only introduced an effect in one event period at a time, keeping effects in all other simulated event periods fixed at zero. This choice was made to limit the number of conditions that needed to be simulated (a combinatorial grid search of all possible effect sizes in all possible event periods quickly becomes computationally intractable), as well as in recognition of the fact that effects in multiple event periods are cumulative (though not linearly) in terms of the model\u2019s ability to detect an effect. Thus, a small effect in a single event period (with all others held at zero) represents the worst-case scenario for our model\u2019s ability to detect an effect in the data. Importantly, the situation where an effect exists in one event period to the exclusion of all others is highly unlikely in practice and would be difficult to interpret in the context of our study. An example of an isolated simulated experiment for an effect introduced in event period \u201cLead1\u201d can be seen in Figure 2 above (Illustrated Effect Test). Note that event period \u201cLag1\u201d is set as the intercept of our model (and thus effects and variance are scaled to this event period), and that effects and variance in event periods prior to \u201cLag1\u201d are measured from our study data. \n\nFigure 3 above (Power Analysis and MDE) illustrates the results of our power analysis for the prescription rate outcome, with curves showing the relationship between effect size and power for effects in each event period after a policy is introduced. Vertical dashed lines (colored) isolate the minimum detectable effect for a given event period at a required power of 0.8. Curves are not exactly symmetric, as prescribing trends prior to policy events are non-zero. Small to medium effects are more difficult to detect for event periods that are further away in time from the period of policy enactment. This makes sense, as the sample size decreases further from the event periods as many states have only enacted policies recently. \n\nIt is important to highlight that our investigation of power and MDE in this study is not a calculation of post-hoc power. It is well known that post-hoc power is a largely uninformative statistical measure that provides little additional information beyond the result of the statistical test used in a study. Here, we do not use any data from states after a policy has been implemented to estimate our distribution in the simulation. By only using data collected prior to policy implementation, we are implicitly treating those years before a policy is implemented as a pilot study for the years after a policy is implemented. We then adopt an assumption that state's prescribing after a policy is passed is well modeled by their behavior before the policy is passed, so long as no policy effects are present. The strength of our estimate of power and MDE is conditioned on this assumption, in the same way that a power analysis in using pilot study data is conditioned on the agreement between the pilot study and the full study.

Codes were checked against each state's profile as described by the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Training and Technical Assistance Center (35). \n\nExposure coding: Coding of the two types of state policy interventions will be collapsed into two levels per policy, as shown in Table 1:\n\n - Statutory limits on opioid prescribing will be collapsed into \"some prescription limits\" or \"no statutory limit/guidelines only.\" States with statutory limits on all initial opioid prescriptions, statutory limits on certain opioid prescriptions (such as those for emergency room walk-in patients), or enforceable limits set by another agency on all or certain opioid prescriptions, will be coded as having some prescription limits. States with nonbinding guidelines or no policy will be coded as not having prescription limits. \n\n- Prescriber mandates for PDMP use policies will be collapsed into \"PDMP use mandate\" or \"no PDMP use mandate.\" States with laws requiring physicians to consult the PDMP before writing all or some opioid prescriptions will be coded as having a PDMP use mandate. States allowing prescribers to access the PDMP but not mandating such access, or states with no PDMP available to prescribers, will be coded as not having a PDMP use mandate. \n\nFinally, we will test the effect of passing either type of legislation by assigning an exposure of 1 if a state has passed either a statutory limit on opioid prescribing or a prescriber mandates for PDMP use; and a 0 if a state has passed neither such policy.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Table 1.

Berger, Anna Solmeyer, Muizz Alaradi, Weston Merrick, Mikaela Binsfeld, Benjamin Nguyen, Ian Williamson", "q3": "The late 1990s saw an increase in the number of healthcare providers prescribing opioid pain relievers, as well as an increase in the number of pills that were prescribed. This culminated in the early 2010s, when the opioid prescribing rate in the United States reached 81.2 prescriptions per 100 people (1). With numerous opioid pain relievers available, opioid overdose rates began spiking across the United States. In 2016, 11.5 million Americans ages 12 or older reported misusing prescription opioids (2). By 2017, 68% of drug overdose deaths involved opioids (3). \n\nIn recent years there have been a number of federal and state policy responses to the opioid abuse crisis. Federal responses have included increasing access to addiction treatment, ensuring overdose-reversing drugs are available to high-risk populations, strengthening public health data reporting and collection, supporting research to understand the problem and find solutions, and advancing pain management and evidence-based pain care (7). The federal government has also streamlined the efforts of several agencies to coordinate responses and address priority areas (8). Strategies include expanded access to naloxone and allowing qualified primary care practitioners, who obtain a waiver, to provide medication-assisted treatment for up to 275 patients (9). \n\nWithin this broader national response, states have begun to implement their own plans and programs to address problematic opioid use and opioid harm within their communities. State-level responses are uniquely important because they are better able to target regional and cultural contributors to community crises. State-responses can be less one-size-fits-all than federal policies, and thus may more effectively address the opioid crisis for citizens of that state. In addition to greater policy specificity, states can encourage social change through the passage of policies, independent of the specific actions of the policies. Because citizens are more directly affected by state-level policies and programs, the passage of policies at the state level provides a signal to the community about the state\u2019s priorities and changes to its social environment. The adoption of a program may encourage changes in community behavior before the program is even initiated as citizens of the state respond to the perceived shift in state priorities. \n\nProminent examples of state-level approaches that have been shown to impact opioid abuse and harm include provisions for Good Samaritan immunity (10), increased availability of rescue drugs, healthcare provider training, and licensing and regulation of pain management facilities (11). Of the variety of state policy responses, two common approaches have focused on moderating opioid prescribing in order to address problems specifically related to prescription opioid drugs (12). \n\nThe earliest state policy responses aimed at moderating opioid prescribing established enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to track prescribing behavior and prescription utilization trends. PDMPs gather electronic information about a patient's history of prescriptions, and potential for misuse, from prescribers and pharmaceutical dispensaries when a prescription is issued. While the utility and impact of PDMPs should not be understated, most state PDMPs were established before the scope and importance of the national opioid crisis was evident. However, many states made an array of changes, including tightening up requirements around use before prescribing, requiring course treatments, and expanding the contexts under which the PDMP must be used. Establishment of PDMPs has been associated with a reduction in opioid poisoning and healthcare admissions for opioid-related treatment (13). States with strict PDMP utilization requirements (specifically, those that have a mandatory requirement that physicians check before issuing at least some opioid prescriptions) have also seen a reduction in opioid prescribing (14). \n\nA second approach directly targeting prescription opioids is the adoption of regulatory limits on opioid prescribing. The Centers for Disease Control's 2016 Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain noted that long-term use often begins with treating acute pain, but a three- to seven-day supply is usually enough for severe pain (15). Shortly after the release of these guidelines, Massachusetts became the first state to adopt a seven-day statutory limit on initial opioid prescriptions (16). At least 33 states enacted legislative opioid prescribing limits, including both limits on all first-time opioid prescriptions and limits affecting only certain prescriptions (e.g., prescriptions for dental or ophthalmologic pain), by October 2018 (17). \n\nPrescribing limits provide an important opportunity to understand the impact of state-level signaling of a crisis response through the implementation of legislation. Because of broad public awareness of the opioid crisis by 2016, state-level adoption of prescribing limits had a greater potential for public visibility than typical state legislation. These policies also specifically targeted the prescription opioid crisis, and thus provided a concrete signal of a state\u2019s intent to change problematic prescribing behavior. Finally, because these policies were implemented at the state level (and not all states have implemented such policies) there is an opportunity to understand how the signaling of a state-level response to a national problem impacts the residents of those states. \n\nThe purpose of this evaluation is to estimate the causal effect of the passage of state-level opioid monitoring programs (i.e., prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use) and prescription limiting legislation on the volume of prescribing for opioid drugs and the rate of fatal opioid poisonings. This evaluation will provide policy makers with an understanding of national trends in opioid prescribing, opioid-related death rates, and the role that state legislation has played in shaping those trends. \n\nPrimary Research Question: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level Medicaid opioid prescription rate, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nSecondary Research Question 1: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level drug poisoning death rate for prescription opioids, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nSecondary Research Question 2: Among Medicaid recipients in all 50 states, does passage of a state-level legislative action regarding prescription drug monitoring programs and/or limitations on opioid prescribing lead to a change in the state-level drug poisoning death rate for all types of opioids, relative to the rate in other states or time periods when there is no law in place? \n\nExploratory Research Questions: We will examine several potential moderators of the association between legislative action and prescription rates and drug poisoning deaths due to opioids. These include: the state\u2019s baseline rate of Medicaid opioid prescribing, the state\u2019s baseline rate of drug poisoning deaths due to opioids, and the state\u2019s demographic characteristics.", "q4": "Hypothesis 1: In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level Medicaid will tend towards lower prescribing rates, compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n\nHypothesis 2: In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level opioid drug-poisoning death rates (due to prescription opioids) will tend towards lower death rates, compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n\nHypothesis 3:  In states that pass prescriber mandates for prescription drug monitoring use and/or limitations on opioid prescribing, changes in state-level opioid drug-poisoning death rates (due to all types of opioids) will tend towards lower death rates compared to states and time periods where such rigorous policies are not in place.\n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, \u201cnatural experiments,\u201d and regression discontinuity designs.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "No.", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q11": "", "q13": "This study utilizes publicly available administrative data for measures of opioid prescribing rates across all 50 states in the United States. Further, our research questions (as stated above) are focused on the impact of individual state policies within the states that enacted them. As such, the study population is fixed and adjustments to study sample sizes to improve statistical power are not possible. However, it is still informative to understand the expected power of the study as it is implemented, as this provides context for interpreting results regardless of statistical significance. Additionally, a power analysis provides an illustration of the minimum detectable effects (MDE) within each study period of interest to our work.", "q14": "We performed our power analysis via simulation using the \u201csimstudy\u201d (27) package in R to generate artificial data from estimates of the population distribution around the parameters to be fit by our event study model. We used these estimates to simulate realistic variance around the parameters of a data generating function (in this case our statistical model), introduced a defined policy effect to a particular event period, and then used our model to test for the presence of the effect. For each introduced effect, we simulated 1000 possible experiments, drawing data from the estimated distributions, and calculated power as the proportion of those simulations where effects were correctly detected.\n\nOur study is concerned with the change in opioid-related outcomes after states enact legislation targeting the opioid problem. We therefore used the data collected in our study for the event periods prior to the policy event to estimate the expected means and variances (in absence of a policy effect) after the policy was enacted. The implicit assumption made by this approach is that event periods after the policy has been enacted will only differ from periods before the policy is enacted if there is a policy effect. Introduced effects were standardized and scaled between -0.6 to 0.6 (i.e., making no assumptions about effect direction). \n\nTo provide the most parsimonious and interpretable estimate of a minimum detectable effect, we only introduced an effect in one event period at a time, keeping effects in all other simulated event periods fixed at zero. This choice was made to limit the number of conditions that needed to be simulated (a combinatorial grid search of all possible effect sizes in all possible event periods quickly becomes computationally intractable), as well as in recognition of the fact that effects in multiple event periods are cumulative (though not linearly) in terms of the model\u2019s ability to detect an effect. Thus, a small effect in a single event period (with all others held at zero) represents the worst-case scenario for our model\u2019s ability to detect an effect in the data. Importantly, the situation where an effect exists in one event period to the exclusion of all others is highly unlikely in practice and would be difficult to interpret in the context of our study. An example of an isolated simulated experiment for an effect introduced in event period \u201cLead1\u201d can be seen in Figure 2 above (Illustrated Effect Test). Note that event period \u201cLag1\u201d is set as the intercept of our model (and thus effects and variance are scaled to this event period), and that effects and variance in event periods prior to \u201cLag1\u201d are measured from our study data. \n\nFigure 3 above (Power Analysis and MDE) illustrates the results of our power analysis for the prescription rate outcome, with curves showing the relationship between effect size and power for effects in each event period after a policy is introduced. Vertical dashed lines (colored) isolate the minimum detectable effect for a given event period at a required power of 0.8. Curves are not exactly symmetric, as prescribing trends prior to policy events are non-zero. Small to medium effects are more difficult to detect for event periods that are further away in time from the period of policy enactment. This makes sense, as the sample size decreases further from the event periods as many states have only enacted policies recently. \n\nIt is important to highlight that our investigation of power and MDE in this study is not a calculation of post-hoc power. It is well known that post-hoc power is a largely uninformative statistical measure that provides little additional information beyond the result of the statistical test used in a study. Here, we do not use any data from states after a policy has been implemented to estimate our distribution in the simulation. By only using data collected prior to policy implementation, we are implicitly treating those years before a policy is implemented as a pilot study for the years after a policy is implemented. We then adopt an assumption that state's prescribing after a policy is passed is well modeled by their behavior before the policy is passed, so long as no policy effects are present. The strength of our estimate of power and MDE is conditioned on this assumption, in the same way that a power analysis in using pilot study data is conditioned on the agreement between the pilot study and the full study.

No states adopted PDMP laws requiring physicians to review PDMP records before Nevada, in 2007. Massachusetts passed the first opioid prescribing limits in 2016. Many states adopted similar policies following these states' lead. \n\nThe identification strategy is a generalized difference-in-differences approach, using event study methodology, that includes a linear two-way (state and time period) fixed effects regression with leads and lags of treatment (18). We will estimate the time-varying effect of adopting each policy during the year of adoption, and one, two, and three or more years after adoption. Levels of opioid prescribing and drug poisoning death rates in each state at each time period will be compared to outcomes in other states that either had not yet adopted similar policies or did not adopt similar policies before the end of the study period. As of the fall of 2019, six states have adopted neither a prescriber mandate for PDMP use nor statutory prescription limits. As recently as the beginning of 2017, seventeen states had not adopted either policy. Categorical state, year, and (when appropriate) quarter fixed effects, as well as fixed effects for state-level time-varying confounders including both annual demographic and economic characteristics, and state-level policies such as marijuana liberalization and Medicaid expansion, will be used to control for fixed and time-varying confounding effects. \n\nThe event study specification makes three essential assumptions (19) that must be satisfied for causal effect identification: \n\n1. Parallel baseline trends are independent of exposure status. In counterfactual notation, the conditional exchangeability assumption can be written as Ya\u2aebA|L, which is to say that the outcome a state would have experienced (Y), at any given time with any given combination of state opioid policies (a), is independent (\u2aeb) of the actual set of state opioid policies that the state had at that time (A), given the identified confounding variables (L). This assumption is untestable in any difference-in-difference analysis, because states are not randomized to receive the policies. However, the absence of pre-policy differential trends lends support to the assumption that post-policy trends would have been parallel if the policies had not been adopted. \n\n2. No anticipatory behavior prior to treatment. This is an extension of the parallel trends assumption. It holds that for all lead periods l&lt;0, the effect of approaching treatment \u03bc_l is 0. This is most plausible for random (exogenous) exposures. While it is reasonable to assume that prescribers and/or opioid users would not change their behavior in anticipation of upcoming legislation, it would not be unreasonable for states with worsening opioid-related outcomes to adopt more stringent controls. Either reason for pre-trends would bias estimated effects. We did not find evidence of differential trends in policy adopting states in the years prior to policy adoption. \n\n3. Treatment effect homogeneity. For each \"cohort\" of policy implementations, the effect \u03bc_l of being in a relative timing lag period l\u22650 is homogeneous regardless of absolute timing t. This assumption can only be tested in the final analysis. The presence of heterogeneous treatment effects does not invalidate results, but rather results in a weighted average of time-varying treatment effects. Several important differences exist between state-years with policies and state-years without policies (see Figure 1 for a Directed Acyclic Graph displaying these variables). As an impact evaluation seeking to estimate the causal effect of state opioid policies on opioid prescribing and opioid-related deaths, this evaluation depends on an assumption of conditional exchangeability between states that did, and did not, adopt opioid policies of interest. According to this assumption, no unmeasured confounding variables are directly associated with state opioid policies and the outcome of interest, conditional on the measured confounding variables. \n\nSeveral unmeasured time-invariant characteristics of each state (labeled \"V\" in Figure 1) may be linked to the outcome after policy change. For example, each state has a fixed baseline rate of the outcome that is associated with the outcome at any follow-up time. We include state fixed effects to account for these characteristics.\n\nWithin states, changes in the age structure of the population, the racial/ethnic composition of the population, the prevailing unemployment rate and employment in the manufacturing sector, and the passage of other relevant laws, such as marijuana liberalization, Medicaid expansion, and opioid-related policies such as Good Samaritan laws and naloxone access laws, may be associated both with the adoption of relevant policies and with either prescriber behavior or the risk of opioid-related mortality. \n\nFinally, national trends across time (labeled \"U\" in Figure 1), such as changing levels of opioid prescribing and mortality may also be linked to the outcome after policy change. We include year fixed effects to account for these national trends. Because national trends are not neatly summarized with a linear or quadratic trend, we will include a categorical year fixed effect.\n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e7375d14a60a504ebbb1205", "file_name": "Figure 1.

The primary source for state opioid prescribing limits was a National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) table of state prescribing limits, (20) which summarized policies enacted through April 4, 2018. Information on subsequent legislation was available through NCSL's Injury Prevention Legislation Database (21) and Ballotpedia's summary of opioid prescription limits and policies by state (22). Information on state PDMP prescriber use mandates was found in the supplement (23) to an article by Haffajee, et al., 2018 (24). That article coded PDMP policies passed through 2014; we extended their coding scheme forward for policies passed between 2015 and 2019 and included in NCSL's Injury Prevention Legislation Database (25).

The coding scheme for specific policies is shown in Table 1. \n\nStatutory limits on opioid prescribing: The primary source of information for coding statutory limits on opioid prescribing was a summary table prepared by the NCSL (29). The NCSL summary table described prescription limiting statutes adopted in 21 states between the first such policy, passed in Massachusetts in 2016, and April 4, 2018. A link to the enabling legislation is included along with a short description of the limitations/requirements and any exceptions to requirements. The NCSL summary table also noted that laws had been passed in nine other states, to authorize another entity to set prescribing limits or guidelines. We filled in the remaining gaps through reference to the nonpartisan online political encyclopedia Ballotpedia, (30) and direct coding of adopted state laws receiving a code of \"Prescription Drug Abuse, Prescribing Guidelines/Limits\" in NCSL's Injury Prevention Legislation Database, (31) which extends through 2019. State policies were independently coded by separate analysts, with consensus resolution of any discrepancies. \n\nPrescriber mandates for PDMP use: The primary source of information used to develop the coding framework for PDMP prescriber mandates came from an article by Haffajee, et al., which coded PDMP policies in all states through 2014 (32). We extended the coding scheme forward through 2019 using NCSL's Injury Prevention Legislation Database (34). Codes were checked against each state's profile as described by the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Training and Technical Assistance Center (35). \n\nExposure coding: Coding of the two types of state policy interventions will be collapsed into two levels per policy, as shown in Table 1:\n\n - Statutory limits on opioid prescribing will be collapsed into \"some prescription limits\" or \"no statutory limit/guidelines only.\" States with statutory limits on all initial opioid prescriptions, statutory limits on certain opioid prescriptions (such as those for emergency room walk-in patients), or enforceable limits set by another agency on all or certain opioid prescriptions, will be coded as having some prescription limits. States with nonbinding guidelines or no policy will be coded as not having prescription limits. \n\n- Prescriber mandates for PDMP use policies will be collapsed into \"PDMP use mandate\" or \"no PDMP use mandate.\" States with laws requiring physicians to consult the PDMP before writing all or some opioid prescriptions will be coded as having a PDMP use mandate. States allowing prescribers to access the PDMP but not mandating such access, or states with no PDMP available to prescribers, will be coded as not having a PDMP use mandate. \n\nFinally, we will test the effect of passing either type of legislation by assigning an exposure of 1 if a state has passed either a statutory limit on opioid prescribing or a prescriber mandates for PDMP use; and a 0 if a state has passed neither such policy.\n", "q16.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e7375d04a60a504ebbb11fe", "file_name": "Table 1.

The National Drug Code (NDC) will be used to identify opioid medications in the Medicaid State Drug Utilization data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released a data file permitting the conversion of prescription opioid medications to Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME). The total MME for each state-year can therefore be calculated and standardized to the number of Medicaid patients in the state that year.\n\n- National Center for Health Statistics Detailed Multiple Cause of Death research files. ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes will be analyzed to identify annual statewide deaths related to common prescription opioid medications and to all opioid drugs. The number of deaths will be treated as a Poisson random variable. \n\nCovariates: To prevent bias due to omitted variables that may be associated with both policy exposure and opioid prescribing and drug poisoning outcomes, the impact analysis will control for 1) additional, related state-level policies (e.g., state Medicaid expansion status and marijuana liberalization, as both medical and recreational uses), 2) state-level demographic characteristics (e.g., proportion of state residents in banded age categories and race/ethnicity categories), 3) state-level economic data (e.g., statewide unemployment rate). We will also include 4) state fixed effects to control for non-time varying unobserved heterogeneity, and 5) yearly, categorical fixed effects to control for nonlinear national trends in the outcome in states that have not adopted policies of interest. \n\nWhen a data source covers only a portion of the time period of interest (for example, ACS includes Medicaid coverage only for 2008-2018), we used regression techniques to impute missing values from alternate data sources (e.g. CPS, a smaller sample with a slightly different measure of Medicaid coverage). Additionally, because sampling-based estimation like the ACS (which is a representative 1% sample of the population each year) are subject to random error, this causes estimates to be more variable in low-population states.

This strategy aims to identify webpages that are easily accessible and most likely to be encountered by patients.\n\nEligibility criteria \nOnline material published by or on behalf of the selected orthopaedic surgeon relating to them or their services will be analysed.  This will usually be a website; but could include online videos, advertisements or social media pages. Sites not generated by the orthopaedic surgeon (e.g. user-generated sites), health search engines (e.g. HealthEngine, RateMDs), medical journals, news outlets and encyclopaedias will be excluded.  \n\nData collection process \nRelevant online material relating to each surgeon will be copied and stored electronically. Any identifiable data \u2013 including names and locations \u2013 will be redacted from the material to facilitate non-biased assessment. To maximise validity, data extraction will be piloted using a \"round table\" of data collectors, where disputes and uncertainties can be discussed.

testimony of a rape victim when it was presented chronologically or with the rape event first. Participants\u2019 evaluations (i.e., whether the events described in the testimony depicted rape or consensual sex) were measured every second as they watched the video of the victim testifying. Specifically, participants moved a slider between two scale endpoints (1 = consensual sex, 100 = rape) when responding to this measure. Using this design, we investigated how participants evaluated the overall testimony by recording the position of the slider at the end of the video. We also investigated how participants evaluated specific events described in this testimony (i.e., the rape event), by recording the position of the slider during certain parts of the video. Contrary to our predictions, participants in both testimony conditions did not differ in how they evaluated the overall testimony. However, participants who watched the testimony where the rape event was presented first evaluated this event as more depictive of rape compared to those who watched the testimony presented in a chronological order.\n\nFurthermore, the results of the study described above showed that the order in which the testimony was presented to participants influenced the variability in their responses regarding whether the events described by the victim were evaluated as rape or consensual sex. When the testimony was presented chronologically, participants converged in their responses using the slider (i.e., moved the slider less often and less extremely between perceiving the testimony as depicting consensual sex or rape) while they watched the victim testify. Conversely, participants were far less consistent when the rape event was presented first in the testimony \u2013 that is, participants were much more variable in their responses using the slider (i.e., moved the slider more often and more extremely between perceiving the testimony as depicting consensual sex or rape). \n\nSince participants\u2019 responses to how they evaluated the victim\u2019s testimony were restricted by the question asked of them (i.e., participants were only able to indicate whether they thought the events described depicted rape or consensual sex), we are somewhat limited in terms of our interpretation of this unexpected result. Specifically, we do not know why participants struggled to decide whether the events described by the victim depicted rape or consensual sex when they watch the rape-first version of the testimony. In a review, Ericsson and Simon (1980) argue that the use of think aloud procedures \u2013 that is, having participants say out loud their thoughts while they complete a task \u2013 can determine the exact cognitive processes a participant uses to come to a decision. Further, such procedures stop the participant from reporting what they think the experimenter wants them to report in a task, as their response is not restricted by a specific question (e.g., do these events depict consensual sex or rape?). As such, if we were to ask participants to think aloud as they watch and interpret the victim\u2019s testimony, their utterances during this task should reflect their authentic interpretations of the testimony (Charters, 2003). This data may then allow us to understand why participants\u2019 evaluations vary in different versions of the victim\u2019s testimony.    \n\nThe aim of the current study is investigate what participants are thinking when they interpret the victim\u2019s testimony. Specifically, participants will be asked to think aloud while watching a testimony that is presented with the rape event first or the same testimony presented in chronological order. Participants\u2019 verbal responses to this task will be recorded and then transcribed, so that their utterances are paired to the time of the video in which they were said. These transcriptions will then be analysed in order to investigate whether participants who watch the rape-first version of the victim\u2019s testimony interpret the events described differently to those who watch the chronological testimony. \n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "This study will be somewhat exploratory in nature.

Participants\u2019 evaluations (i.e., whether the events described in the testimony depicted rape or consensual sex) were measured every second as they watched the video of the victim testifying. Specifically, participants moved a slider between two scale endpoints (1 = consensual sex, 100 = rape) when responding to this measure. Using this design, we investigated how participants evaluated the overall testimony by recording the position of the slider at the end of the video. We also investigated how participants evaluated specific events described in this testimony (i.e., the rape event), by recording the position of the slider during certain parts of the video. Contrary to our predictions, participants in both testimony conditions did not differ in how they evaluated the overall testimony. However, participants who watched the testimony where the rape event was presented first evaluated this event as more depictive of rape compared to those who watched the testimony presented in a chronological order.\n\nFurthermore, the results of the study described above showed that the order in which the testimony was presented to participants influenced the variability in their responses regarding whether the events described by the victim were evaluated as rape or consensual sex. When the testimony was presented chronologically, participants converged in their responses using the slider (i.e., moved the slider less often and less extremely between perceiving the testimony as depicting consensual sex or rape) while they watched the victim testify. Conversely, participants were far less consistent when the rape event was presented first in the testimony \u2013 that is, participants were much more variable in their responses using the slider (i.e., moved the slider more often and more extremely between perceiving the testimony as depicting consensual sex or rape). \n\nSince participants\u2019 responses to how they evaluated the victim\u2019s testimony were restricted by the question asked of them (i.e., participants were only able to indicate whether they thought the events described depicted rape or consensual sex), we are somewhat limited in terms of our interpretation of this unexpected result. Specifically, we do not know why participants struggled to decide whether the events described by the victim depicted rape or consensual sex when they watch the rape-first version of the testimony. In a review, Ericsson and Simon (1980) argue that the use of think aloud procedures \u2013 that is, having participants say out loud their thoughts while they complete a task \u2013 can determine the exact cognitive processes a participant uses to come to a decision. Further, such procedures stop the participant from reporting what they think the experimenter wants them to report in a task, as their response is not restricted by a specific question (e.g., do these events depict consensual sex or rape?). As such, if we were to ask participants to think aloud as they watch and interpret the victim\u2019s testimony, their utterances during this task should reflect their authentic interpretations of the testimony (Charters, 2003). This data may then allow us to understand why participants\u2019 evaluations vary in different versions of the victim\u2019s testimony.    \n\nThe aim of the current study is investigate what participants are thinking when they interpret the victim\u2019s testimony. Specifically, participants will be asked to think aloud while watching a testimony that is presented with the rape event first or the same testimony presented in chronological order. Participants\u2019 verbal responses to this task will be recorded and then transcribed, so that their utterances are paired to the time of the video in which they were said. These transcriptions will then be analysed in order to investigate whether participants who watch the rape-first version of the victim\u2019s testimony interpret the events described differently to those who watch the chronological testimony. \n", "q4": "This study will be somewhat exploratory in nature. Although we expect that participants who watch the rape-first version of the testimony will likely interpret the events described differently to those who watch the chronological testimony \u2013 we, however, will not make any specific predictions on how they will differ. Instead, participants\u2019 responses to the think aloud measure will be analysed using a data driven thematic analysis using Leximancer software.
