We use the Philanthropy Scale (Schuyt, Bekkers, &amp; Smit, 2010) with 7 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 not at all likely to 5 extremely likely. General norms of reciprocity are measured using the General norms of reciprocity scale (Perugini et al. 2003). Self-reported altruism using the self-reported altruism scale (SRA; Rushton, Chrisjohn, &amp; Fekken, 1981) is measured with 20 items answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 never to 5 very often. Personal moral norms are measured with 3 items, answered on a on a on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree. Furthermore, background information and demographic controls are measured: knowledge about organ donation, donation, transplantation in social network, trust in medical system, subjective health, age, gender, religious and ethnic background.  \n\nInteraction scenario (altruism)\nIn addition to altruism measured with the SRA scale we offer an interaction scenario to the participants. We make participants think about a social interaction between them and a stranger. They are told to have been given \u20ac10. They can decide to give some, none or all to another person whose identity will be kept unknown and that their decision is completely anonymous. They are then asked how much money they would want to give the other person (0-10\u20ac)? \u20ac______________\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Our key dependent variables are willingness to make a living kidney or liver lobe donation to a friend, stranger or relative and intention to register or de-register as posthumous donor under the different conditions. First, we will assess the main and interaction effects of the treatments on the willingness to donate and intention to (de)register using ANOVA.. Second, as both variables are measured as interval variables, we will apply linear regression models to our data for including the respective mediators. We conduct mediation analyses (i.e., ZMediation, Iacobucci 2012) and/or structural equation models to test to what extent the social norms, beliefs, and reputation building are able to explain the effects of consent system and hypothetical registration rate on willingness to make a living donation and organ donor (de)registration for posthumous donations.

The UCLA Loneliness Scale is one of the most widely used self-report measures of loneliness. It consists of 20 items on a 4-point Likert scale of \u201cOften\u201d, \u201cSometimes\u201d, \u201cRarely\u201d, \u201cNever\u201d, resulting in an overall aggregate score of loneliness. Vassar and Crosby (2008) have found generalized reliability estimates of .86 to .95 across 13 studies for the UCLA 3. The scale has also been shown to have good construct and convergent validity (Russell, 1996). \nPersonality Assessment Inventory, Non-Support Scale (PAI Non-support; Morey, 1991). The PAI Non-Support is an 8-item subscale of the PAI which seeks to evaluate the amount of family and friend support that an individual perceives. This scale is included in this study as a method of corroborating participants\u2019 assessment of their loneliness on the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Items are rated as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d. \nPersonal Report of Communication Apprehension scale (PRCA-24; McCroskey, 1982). The PRCA-24 is a 24-item self-report measure of anxiety in different types of communication. The scale is divided into four types of communicative situations including participating in group discussions, speaking in meetings, engaging in conversations, and giving a speech. Participants rate whether each statement applies to them on a 5-point scale from 1 \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5 \u201cstrongly agree\u201d. Ratings can be aggregated into the four specific situations, or can be compiled as a total score. Internal consistency estimates (alphas) range from .93 to .95 (McCroskey, Beatty, Kearny, &amp; Plax, 1985).\nNEO-PI-R (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). The NEO-PI-R is a self-report inventory of personality. The present study uses the items for the neuroticism subscale. These items are further divided into 6 facets of neuroticism: anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability. Items are statements that are evaluated on a 5-point scale of how much the statement applies to the rater from 1 \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d to 5 \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d. Internal consistency reliability for the neuroticism scale is reported to be .90 (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).\nPersonality Research Form (PRF; Jackson, 1989), select subscales. The Affiliation, Harmavoidance, Social Recognition, and Succorance facets of the PRF were selected for this study. Each contains sixteen statements which participants rate as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d. From the PRF manual (Jackson, 1989), internal consistency reliabilities for the scales of interest are: .88 (Affiliation), .91 (Harmavoidance), .91 (Social Recognition), and .91 (Succorance).\nSmartphone use. Smartphone use will be evaluated objectively using three different types of information taken from built-in apps on Apple iPhone devices and Huawei Android devices. These two types of device were chosen specifically because they collect weekly totals of the information, which will give a broader picture of typical use than a daily snapshot. Participants will be instructed on how to access the appropriate information. They will first enter their weekly screen time, which gives an idea of how much time is spent overall on their smartphone. Participants are also asked to enter the number of \u201cpick ups\u201d (iPhone) or \u201cunlocks\u201d (Huawei), which is an estimate of how frequently individuals are using and checking their smartphones.  The third type of information for participants to enter is the five most used apps, which will be coded into categories, based on the Apple App Store. In addition to the objective data, participants are also asked to rank order 15 possible smartphone uses in order of importance to them. \nDemographic information. Age and gender information will be collected, as well as living arrangements. Participants are asked to choose from options that best describe their living situation: \u201cAlone\u201d, \u201cWith roommates (shared common spaces)\u201d, \u201cWith a spouse/long term partner\u201d, \u201cWith parents/relatives/caregivers\u201d or \u201cOther (please specify)\u201d.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q16": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q17": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Data will first be reviewed using descriptive statistics and an analysis of demographic information.
