periprocedural complications in patients undergoing trans-femoral diagnostic and interventional procedures and have been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as costs for the health-care system. Therefore, the shift, recently observed, from femoral to radial as access of choice has been supported by the possibility to decrease such adverse events, thanks to its superficial and easily compressible nature. In this direction, several trials and observational registries have recently shown that radial access is associated with a better net clinical benefit compared to femoral access; approach that is now recommended as the first choice in the current guidelines on myocardial revascularization by the European Society of Cardiology.  \nHowever, crossovers to trans-femoral access (TFA) still occur in about 7% of cases, because of anatomical constrictions, including the small artery size or the occurrence of radial spasm, or because of the presence of clinical conditions causing the weakness or absence of the radial pulse (i.e. cardiogenic shock, subclavian stenosis). Furthermore, procedures requiring the use of TFA because of the large-diameter delivery sheaths, such as transcatheter valve replacement or endoprosthesis implantation, are steadily increasing worldwide, thus further enlarging the number of patients requiring TFA. \nBecause the success and freedom from complications are generally related to the case-volume, concerns have been raised about the fact that the new generation of interventional cardiologists, experienced primarily with the radial approach, may become less practiced at performing procedures using TFA; a circumstance that potentially increases the risk of procedural complications. \nIn this scenario, adopting ultrasound-guided cannulation (UGC) of the femoral artery may potentially decrease such adverse events. Published in the 2010 by Seto and Colleagues, the Femoral Arterial Access With Ultrasound Trial (FAUST) trial randomized 1,004 patients undergoing TFA invasive procedures to UGC or standard approach and showed the superiority of USG in the rates of successful cannulation (primary endpoint), and a slightly, but significant, reduction in vascular complications. In the last years several trials and observational registries have been published evaluating the effectiveness of USG in patients undergoing percutaneous invasive interventions, providing new insights in a context of new technologies and invasive procedures such as percutaneous treatment of valvular interventions or the treatment of complex coronary lesions, that may require larger guide-catheters as well as the use of hemodynamic support devices.

frameworks are lacking components of self-management, especially from the patient or caregiver\u2019s perspective. In our previous narrative review, the majority of medication management frameworks are focused on patient adherence to a specific medication regimen.

Psychopathy and the Neural Bases of Antisocial Empathy\n2. Neural Representational Similarity in Judgments of Morality and Harm\n3. Neural Correlates of Intergroup Rejection and Aggression\n\n---------Project 1: Psychopathy and the Neural Bases of Antisocial Empathy---------\nAggressive behaviors inflict massive costs on public health. Psychopathy \u2014 the tendency to be callous, manipulative, and lack remorse \u2014 is one of the most central predictors of aggression and a core feature of psychopathology. Psychopathic individuals\u2019 antisocial acts have long been thought to be due to an inability to empathize with their victims. However, recent work suggests that psychopathic individuals have intact empathic abilities. Instead of employing their empathy to help others, psychopathic individuals appear to use empathy to exact greater harm on their victims. Antisocial empathy, its neural bases, and its effects on the aggression of psychopathic individuals all remain unexamined. Therefore, we have developed the following overarching research questions:\n\nResearch Question 1A: Will psychopathic individuals exhibit accurate empathic processing when provided an antisocial motivation to do so?\n\nResearch Question 1B: What are the neural correlates of antisocial empathy among psychopathic individuals?\n\nResearch Question 1C: Will the link between psychopathy and aggression be mediated by antisocial empathy performance and the neural correlates thereof?\n\n---------Project 2: Neural Representational Similarity in Judgments of Morality and Harm---------\nA leading approach to understanding the psychological bases of human morality suggests that at the core of moral judgments are perceptions of harm. More specifically, when individuals seek to determine whether an action is immoral or not, they are actually attempting to identify the extent to which that action is harmful. However, other theoretical approaches challenge this harm-based account of morality. To empirically test the accuracy of this harm-based approach, we have developed the following research question.\n\nResearch Question 2.

To manipulate whether such empathic processing is antisocially- or prosocially-motivated, participants are informed prior to the task that they are part of a team of VCU students who are completing the study in competition with a team of students from the rival school (University of Richmond [UofR]). Participants are instructed that they will view members of their own team and the opposing team in varying levels of pain and that they will use these images (ad the ratings of them they provide) to determine which types of aversive stimuli to apply (shock, heat, cold, poke) to their opponents for maximal pain infliction and to their team-mates for minimal pain infliction. In the pain rating task, participants viewed 5 VCU targets and 5 UofR targets. They viewed each target 4 times, in varying states of pain that were paired with one of the four fictitious sources of pain (shock, heat, cold, poke). This resulted in a total of 20 antisocial empathy (i.e., UofR) trials and 20 prosocial empathy (i.e., VCU) trials, which were lumped into 2 blocks --- one block containing 20 trials of one empathy-type.

Regressors-of-interest for the empathy rating task will include antisocial empathy pain viewing, antisocial empathy pain rating, prosocial empathy pain viewing, and prosocial empathy pain rating. Pain rating trials will be modeled by both a parametrically-modulated regressor (that is weighted by the 1-4 rating provided by the participant for that trial) and a non-modulated regressor. Six head motion parameters will also be included as nuisance regressors. Six linear contrasts will model each of these six regressors compared to the implicit, un-modeled baseline. Then, two additional contrasts will model antisocial &gt; prosocial empathy pain viewing and antisocial &gt; prosocial empathy pain rating (parametrically-modulated). \n\nSecond-level (across-participants). Each of participants\u2019 8 contrast maps from the second\nlevel will be fed into a group level, mixed-effects GLM that creates whole-brain\ngroup average maps for each contrast.

The DACC and anterior insula masks will be acquired from previous research (Chester et al., 2018).

Linear contrasts will model each of the 6 judgment-types against the implicit baseline. From these whole-brain Z-statistic contrast maps, we will extract a matrix that represents the pattern of activity for each judgment-type across the voxels of the DMPFC ROI (each row represents a judgment-type and each column represents a DMPFC voxel). At each DMPFC voxel, pairwise comparisons (calculated in the form of correlation distance) will compare each judgment-type to the other 5 judgment-types to create a Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) that is specific to that voxel.

Neural Correlates of Intergroup Rejection and Aggression\n\n---------Project 1: Psychopathy and the Neural Bases of Antisocial Empathy---------\nAggressive behaviors inflict massive costs on public health. Psychopathy \u2014 the tendency to be callous, manipulative, and lack remorse \u2014 is one of the most central predictors of aggression and a core feature of psychopathology. Psychopathic individuals\u2019 antisocial acts have long been thought to be due to an inability to empathize with their victims. However, recent work suggests that psychopathic individuals have intact empathic abilities. Instead of employing their empathy to help others, psychopathic individuals appear to use empathy to exact greater harm on their victims. Antisocial empathy, its neural bases, and its effects on the aggression of psychopathic individuals all remain unexamined. Therefore, we have developed the following overarching research questions:\n\nResearch Question 1A: Will psychopathic individuals exhibit accurate empathic processing when provided an antisocial motivation to do so?\n\nResearch Question 1B: What are the neural correlates of antisocial empathy among psychopathic individuals?\n\nResearch Question 1C: Will the link between psychopathy and aggression be mediated by antisocial empathy performance and the neural correlates thereof?\n\n---------Project 2: Neural Representational Similarity in Judgments of Morality and Harm---------\nA leading approach to understanding the psychological bases of human morality suggests that at the core of moral judgments are perceptions of harm. More specifically, when individuals seek to determine whether an action is immoral or not, they are actually attempting to identify the extent to which that action is harmful. However, other theoretical approaches challenge this harm-based account of morality. To empirically test the accuracy of this harm-based approach, we have developed the following research question.\n\nResearch Question 2.

To manipulate whether such empathic processing is antisocially- or prosocially-motivated, participants are informed prior to the task that they are part of a team of VCU students who are completing the study in competition with a team of students from the rival school (University of Richmond [UofR]). Participants are instructed that they will view members of their own team and the opposing team in varying levels of pain and that they will use these images (ad the ratings of them they provide) to determine which types of aversive stimuli to apply (shock, heat, cold, poke) to their opponents for maximal pain infliction and to their team-mates for minimal pain infliction. In the pain rating task, participants viewed 5 VCU targets and 5 UofR targets. They viewed each target 4 times, in varying states of pain that were paired with one of the four fictitious sources of pain (shock, heat, cold, poke). This resulted in a total of 20 antisocial empathy (i.e., UofR) trials and 20 prosocial empathy (i.e., VCU) trials, which were lumped into 2 blocks --- one block containing 20 trials of one empathy-type. The order of these blocks were randomly determined. Within each block, the order of the 20 trials will be randomly determined by the computer for each participant.\n\n---------Project 2.

The order of the scenarios is randomly-determined by the computer for each participant. Each scenario will be judged along 4 criteria, randomly-selected from 6 possible judgment-types (harmful, immoral, intentional, gross, unpleasant, weird).

In the first 2 blocks of the game, they are included by their outgroup partners (i.e., they receive an equal number of ball-tosses), yet in the third block, after 30 seconds of inclusion, participants are excluded by their outgroup opponents for ~50 seconds. The temporal sequence of this inclusion-then-exclusion manipulation is fixed across participants.\n\nParticipants will then complete the aggression task again, against the same opponent from the first aggression task and who just excluded them in the Cyberball task.

Reconstructed functional volumes will undergo head motion correction to the median functional volume using FSL\u2019s MCFLIRT tool. FSL\u2019s Brain Extraction Tool will be used to remove non-brain tissue from all functional and structural volumes. After a series of data quality checks, functional volumes will undergo interleaved slice-timing correction, pre-whitening, spatial smoothing (using a 5mm full-width-half-maximum Gaussian kernel), and temporal high-pass filtering (100s cutoff). These processed brain volumes will be fed into subsequent data analyses.\n\nB. fMRI Data Analysis:\nPreprocessed fMRI data will be analyzed using two-level general linear\nmodeling. \n\nThe first level (within-participants). Participants\u2019 whole-brain functional volumes from each run of the empathy rating task will be entered into a fixed-effects general linear model (GLM) that will model events using a canonical double-gamma hemodynamic response function with a temporal derivative. Regressors-of-interest for the empathy rating task will include antisocial empathy pain viewing, antisocial empathy pain rating, prosocial empathy pain viewing, and prosocial empathy pain rating. Pain rating trials will be modeled by both a parametrically-modulated regressor (that is weighted by the 1-4 rating provided by the participant for that trial) and a non-modulated regressor. Six head motion parameters will also be included as nuisance regressors. Six linear contrasts will model each of these six regressors compared to the implicit, un-modeled baseline. Then, two additional contrasts will model antisocial &gt; prosocial empathy pain viewing and antisocial &gt; prosocial empathy pain rating (parametrically-modulated). \n\nSecond-level (across-participants). Each of participants\u2019 8 contrast maps from the second\nlevel will be fed into a group level, mixed-effects GLM that creates whole-brain\ngroup average maps for each contrast. In addition to these aggregated group masks, this GLM will also model each participant\u2019s primary psychopathy scores from the SRP-III as a continuous, whole-brain regressor and will create aggregated group masks for these regression analyses as well. Cluster-based, family-wise error-rate (FWER) correction\nusing Gaussian random field theory will then be applied to each of these 16, group contrast maps using a cluster identification threshold of Z &gt; 2.3. Clusters will be retained that pass a significance threshold of p &lt; .05. \n\nThese group-level analyses will be repeated using an 'empathy network' region-of-interest (ROI) mask that includes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC), bilateral anterior insula, VLPFC, VMPFC, and PCC. The DACC and anterior insula masks will be acquired from previous research (Chester et al., 2018). The remaining masks will be acquired from the AAL atlas (VLPFC = orbital + opercular + triangularis aspects of the inferior frontal gyrus mask; VMPFC = medial aspect of the orbital gyrus mask; PCC = posterior cingulate mask).\n\nChester, D.

Pain ratings from the prosocial condition will be modeled as a covariate upon both the dependent and mediating variables.

Neural Representational Similarity in Judgments of Morality and Harm---------\n\nH9-Representational Similarity Analyses:\nfMRI data preprocessing and analysis will unfold in an identical manner to Project 1, excepting that the within-participants, first-level GLM will include a regressor-of-interest for each of the 6 judgment types (Harm Judgments, Immoral Judgments, Weird Judgments, Disgust Judgments, Intentional Judgments, Unpleasant Judgments; and nuisance regressors that capture moral scenario trials and head motion). Linear contrasts will model each of the 6 judgment-types against the implicit baseline. From these whole-brain Z-statistic contrast maps, we will extract a matrix that represents the pattern of activity for each judgment-type across the voxels of the DMPFC ROI (each row represents a judgment-type and each column represents a DMPFC voxel). At each DMPFC voxel, pairwise comparisons (calculated in the form of correlation distance) will compare each judgment-type to the other 5 judgment-types to create a Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) that is specific to that voxel. We will then aggregate RDMs across the voxels of the DMPFC. The DMPFC ROI will be determined by both fall within the AAL atlas' superior frontal gyrus mask *and* are identified by the Neurosynth meta-analytic results for the term 'moral'. \n\nWe will then aggregate these 6 RDMs across participants, creating a 6x6 RDM that compares each judgment-type to each other judgment-type, from which we will draw our inferences by computing a Fisher's Z transformation of the associations at each cell of the RDM and computing a one-sample t-test against 0 for each cell and using the following online utility to examine whether the correlations are significantly different from one another: http://quantpsy.org/corrtest/corrtest2.htm\n\nTo conduct these RSA models, we will modify the Python/R code publicly-provided here: https://github.com/markallenthornton/MIND18_RSA_tutorial/blob/master/Representational_similarity_analysis.Rmd\n\n---------Project 3.

MRI Aggression Tasks\nfMRI data preprocessing and analysis will unfold in an identical manner to Project 1, excepting that the first-level, within-participants-within-run GLM will include regressors-of-interest for Outgroup Aggression, Ingroup Aggression, Outgroup Provocation (parametrically-modulated), Ingroup Provocation (parametrically-modulated), Outgroup Provocation (non-parametrically-modulated), and Ingroup Provocation (non-parametrically-modulated); and nuisance regressors that capture Wins, Losses, Competitions, and head motion). Linear contrasts will model each of the 6 regressors-of-interest against the implicit baseline, as well as Outgroup &gt; Ingroup Aggression and Outgroup &gt; Ingroup Provocation (parametrically-modulated). This GLM will be run separately for the pre-rejection and post-rejection runs for each participant.\n\nA second-level, within-participants-across-runs GLM will combine the pre-rejection and post-rejection runs, modeling each run separately, combined, and contrasting Post-Rejection &gt; Pre-Rejection. \n\nA series of third-level, across-participants GLM will create group contrast maps for (A) the first-level pre-rejection GLM, (B) the first-level post-rejection GLM, and (C) the combined, second-level post-rejection + pre-rejection runs.\n\nB. Cyberball Task\nA first-level, within-participants GLM will include two regressors-of-interest for the Accept and Reject blocks, and then regressors for the 'Get Ready' trials and head motion. Linear contrasts will compare Reject &gt; Accept. A second-level GLM aggregated these contrasts maps across participants and across the entire brain.\n\nH14-Mediation modeling:\nWe will extract rejection-related (reject &gt; accept) brain activity estimates (in the form of % BOLD signal change values) from the DACC and anterior insula ROIs. We will also extract outgroup-aggression-related (outgroup &gt; ingroup aggression) from both the pre-rejection and post-rejection runs of the MRI Aggression Task using significant clusters identified in the univariate whole-brain approach.  These outgroup-aggression-related activity estimates will be entered into a mediation model as the mediator of the effect of rejection-related DACC/insula activity on aggressive behavior (as measured by the outgroup-directed noise blasts from the post-rejection run of the MRI aggression task). Pre-rejection outgroup-aggression-related activity will be modeled as a covariate upon the dependent and mediating variables. The PROCESS macro version 3.2 for SPSS will be used to conduct nonparametric bootstrapping (using 5,000 bootstrapped resamples) to test the significance of this neural mechanism\u2019s indirect

If a participant does not meet the pre-selection criteria, the survey will end. If a participant meets all the pre-selection criteria, they will be asked to read a \u201cparticipant information section\u201d and sign an electronic consent form. After that, they will be asked to fill in the demographic information (e.g. age, gender, country of residence and occupation) and the Paranoia Scale (Fenigstein &amp; Vanable, 1992). \n\nNext, participants who met the pre-selection rules will then receive an email from the researcher to sign up for the lab sessions.

Participants will be asked to share past experiences in response to five neutral cue words (library, onion, uncle, table, shoe).

For each event, participants will be asked to share 3 familiar details of the event \u2013 setting, person and object and give a title for each event (Addis, Pan, Vu, Laiser &amp; Schacter, 2009; Madore et al., 2018, Barry et al., 2019). Participants will also be asked to rate on a scale from +50 to -50 with 0 being neutral, indicating to which extent their memory makes them feel positive or negative, as well as ranking their familiarity with each detail, with 1 being least familiar and 9 being the most familiar. The event involved should be a single day event in one setting. At the end of the stimulus collection, the participants will complete a 2-minute filler task on odd/ even number judgement (Stark &amp; Squire, 2001).\n\nAfter the filler task, participants will be randomly assigned to either a neutral memory specificity induction or control induction. The order of inductions will be counterbalanced between participants. At the end of the session, participants will complete a random selection of 7 items of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) to measure hostile social cognitive biases (Combs et al., 2007). \n\nWhen the participants return to the lab for a second session, they will be assigned to the remaining induction and fill out a random selection of 7 items of the AIHQ again. At the end of the second session, the participants will be fully debriefed.\n\nNeutral induction \nIn the memory specificity induction, participants are given a randomly selected title from one of the memories that they ranked as familiar and neutral, along with three details of the remembered event from the stimulus collection session.

The scores ranges from 20 to 100 and a higher score represents a higher level of paranoia.  \n\nSelf-referencing in memory\nInterviews of the stimulus collection and episodic memory induction will be transcribed and coded based on Barry et al (2019) and Wang\u2019s (2006) article for specificity (specific/ non-specific; positive/ neutral/ negative) and self-referencing (self/other ratio and autonomous orientation).
