smooth functioning of most types of human relations (e.g., Akerlof, 1970; Reis, Clark, &amp; Holmes, 2004), including communal and exchange/market-pricing relationships (Clark &amp; Mills, 1993; Fiske, 1992). Our previous research showed that market mindset might reduce communal trust experienced in the communal-sharing model of relationships, but foster transactional trust associated with the market-pricing model of relationships and one's desire to maximize own outcomes. This experiment is aimed at investigating the mechanism behind these divergent effects of market mindset on trust. \n\nAlthough in both market and communal contexts trust involves vulnerability and uncertainty on the part of trustors (e.g. Coleman, 1990, Deutsch, 1962, Yamagishi, 1998), different qualities of the other person might be crucial when deciding whether to trust the other person. Communal relationships are based on concern for others and their needs (Clark &amp; Mills, 1993). Helping is non-contingent and the main values include generosity, altruism, and community. A dimension of social judgment that exemplifies these traits is communion (Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007). Those high in communion care for the interests of others, are benevolent, and empathetic. On the other hand, in the context of market relationships our focus is on receiving at least a comparable return of our input and the most commonly embraced values are agency, efficacy, and self-sufficiency (Clark &amp; Mills, 1993). As a result, other person\u2019s traits that matter in this context are their competence (including an ability to provide us with the direct returns we desire), understanding of the market rules, as well as their self-interest embedded in the positive outcome of this interaction. Agency is a dimension underlying social judgment that encompasses these characteristics (e.g. Abele &amp; Wojciszke, 2007). A person judged to be agentic is focused on their own goals, decisive, and efficient. Indeed, previous research showed that agency traits are selected more frequently in exchange relationships than in communal relationships (Abele &amp; Brack, 2013). \n\nIn the current study, we aim at investigating whether the level of trust expressed in the Trust Game is affected by the level of communion and agency of the trustee, and whether this effect is moderated by the construal of the social situation as market exchange or communal sharing. Consistent with the results of the previous studies (e.g. Liberman, Samuels, &amp; Ross, 2004), we expect that a stimulus situation can be framed in different ways, affecting its interpretation. Consequently, when Trust Game is introduced to the participants as the Wall Street Task it should evoke a market exchange context, whereas when Trust Game is named the Community Task it should induce a communal context. In our study, we will also manipulate trustee's level of communion and agency.

The CW scale consists of the following items: affectionate, empathetic, friendly, caring, warm in relations with others.

Both the instructions to the game as well as the captions throughout the game will be changed accordingly, depending on the condition. The exact wording of the main instructions can be seen below:\n\nRULES OF THE WALL STREET / COMMUNITY TASK\nPlease read this description carefully in order to understand the rules of the task. \nIn the WALL STREET/COMMUNITY TASK, you can be assigned the role of Person A or Person B.\n1. At the beginning of the WALL STREET/COMMUNITY TASK Person A will be endowed with $1. Person B will not be endowed with any money.\n2. Person A can keep the entire endowment for him/herself or give any amount of it to Person B.\n3. The amount sent by Person A will be automatically tripled. Each transferred cent turns into three cents on the account of Person B. The amount that Person A leaves for him/herself remains unchanged.\n4. Person B may send any amount of the received money back to Person A. The amount sent back by Person B will no longer be multiplied.\n4. The final amount accumulated by each person will be paid out once the study is completed.\n\nManipulation of Trustee's Agency and Communion \nTo manipulate trustee\u2019s agency and communion, we will show participants trustee's responses to ten items of the agency and communion questionnaire (measure by Abele, Hauke, Peters, Louvet, Szymkow, &amp; Duan, 2016). The scale\u2019s title will not be used in the instructions. Abele et al. (2016) differentiated Agency into assertiveness (AA) and competence (AC) and Communion into warmth (CW) and morality (CM). In this study we decided to only use the Warmth and Competence subscales of the questionnaire, because they better represent the definitional characteristics of communal and exchange relationships (Clark &amp; Mills, 2011; Fiske, 1992). The AC scale is composed of the following items: capable, efficient, intelligent, clever, and competent. The CW scale consists of the following items: affectionate, empathetic, friendly, caring, warm in relations with others. Depending on the experimental condition, the trustee's responses will be presented as being: 1) high in the agency traits and high in the communion traits, 2) high in the agency traits and low in the communion traits, 3) low in both agency and communion traits, 4) low in agency traits and high in communion traits. Participants will be familiarized with the scale, by filling it in themselves in the beginning of the study.\n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The outcome variable of interest is the amount of money transferred to the second person in the Trust Game.

Then, in planned contrasts, we will decompose the three-way interaction and test examine the two-way interactions between agency and game framing and between communion and effect framing. In terms of simple effects, we will compare (1) the effect size for agency when game is framed as Wall Street Task and as Community Task, and (2) effect size for communion when game is framed as Wall Street Task and as Community Task.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href":

No data have been collected for this study yet\n\n\n2.\tWhat's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study? \nThis study will be a direct methodological replication of a previous pre-registered project (osf.io/dh6gf), with the main aim being to test whether a within-person change in efficacy can in turn predict a within-person change in collective action intentions. The same procedure and materials will be used from the previous project (with one alteration, see Section 3). The justification for this replication are: \n\u2022\tTo address a sampling error in the original study, in that due to a technical error, only 18 \u2013 19 year olds were able to take part in the study. Whilst this does not negate the findings from the original study, we felt it was important to see if findings could be replicated with a wider age sample, with 18 years old being the lower limit, and no upper age limit. \n\u2022\tExploratory analysis from the original study found significant effects for the relationship between efficacy as a mediator variable, and collective self-objectification (CSO) and empowering emotions as outcome variables. Therefore, we are adding these variables to the main analysis, and pre-registering the predicted significant pathways for this model. \nFor both models, we will test two concurrent dynamic mediations; firstly, change between time one and time two for both the mediator and outcome variables, and secondly, change between time one and time three for both the mediator and outcome variables. We will also test a sequential dynamic mediation, with change between time one and time two for the mediator variable, and change between time one and time three for the outcome variables. \nSimilarly to the previous project, for our first model we predict that those who see the empowering stimulus will display a greater change in efficacy beliefs between time one and time three compared to participants in the control condition. In turn they will show a greater change in willingness to take action between time one and time three (see red pathway in figure 1). We also predict that changes in efficacy and action intentions will be greater in those who see the empowering stimulus if levels of those variables are initially lower at time one (see blue pathways in figure 1). \n \n\nFigure 1. A model showing predicted direction of significant pathways for the first model. Small dotted lines are pathways fixed at \u20181\u2019, as they set the measurement scale for latent variables, and/or are necessary for model identification purposes (Byrne 2009). Double-headed arrows indicate that two variables will be correlated. Coloured lines represent key pathways being tested. \n\n\nFor our second model, we predict that those in the experimental condition will display a greater change in efficacy between time one and time three compared to participants in the control condition. In turn, they will show a greater change in CSO and empowering emotions between time one and time three (see red pathways in figure 2). We also predict that changes in efficacy beliefs, CSO and empowering emotions will be greater if levels of those variables are initially lower at time one (see blue pathways in figure 2).\n\n\nFigure 2.

Double-headed arrows indicate that two variables will be correlated. Coloured lines represent key pathways being tested. \n\n\n\n\n3.\tDescribe the key dependent variable(s) specifying how they will be measured. \n\nIn conceptual terms, the key dependent variables are change in efficacy and change in action intentions, and for our second analysis, they are change in efficacy, CSO and empowering emotions. These will be operationalised by measuring key variables across three different time points using a self-report questionnaire. Change across time periods on a given measure will then be represented as a latent variable in order to assess associations between the manipulation and key variables. \nEfficacy will be measured on two different sub-scales; group efficacy and participative efficacy. Following findings from the original study, it was decided that political efficacy was not a dimension being affected by the video intervention, and will therefore not be included in this questionnaire. We also add two additional key variables, measuring CSO and empowerment emotions. The key variables and scales being used in the main analyses are: \n\u2022\tGroup efficacy (4 items)\n\u2022\tParticipative efficacy (4 items)\n\u2022\tAction intentions (8 items)\n\u2022\tEmpowerment emotions (8 items)\n\u2022\tCSO (8 items)\nAgain, we will also measure legitimacy beliefs and a range of emotions towards the issue and the campaign (total of 29 emotion items).\n\n\n\n4.\tHow many and which conditions will participants be assigned to? \n\nThe procedure will be a direct replication of the previous project, with participants being randomly assigned to either the control condition or the experimental condition by the survey software. \n\n\n5.\tSpecify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis. \n\nSimilarly to the previous project, a dynamic mediation analysis will be carried out using structural equation modelling in AMOS. Change in efficacy beliefs between time one and time two, and change in action intentions between time one and time three, will be the mediator and outcome variables respectively. See figure 1 for a diagram of the model that will be tested. For the second model, change in efficacy beliefs between time one and time three will be the mediator variable, with change in CSO and empowering emotions, both between time one and time three, will be the outcome variables. See figure 2 for a diagram of the model that will be tested.  \n\n\n6.\tAny secondary analyses? \n\nThere will be no secondary analyses for this project. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\tHow many observations will be collected or what will determine the sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined. \n\nWe will aim to recruit 180 participants at all three time points using Prolific Academic, which is the maximum sample we can recruit given our budget and payment rate (\u00a35 per participant). However, we will aim to recruit up to 200 participants at time 1 to allow for approximately 10% drop-out over the three time points. In terms of power analysis, the closest analogue in G*power is a repeated-between interaction in a mixed ANOVA. A sample size of 180 would provide just over 80% power to detect an effect size of approximately f = .04 or \uf068\uf032p = .02, which represent small-to-medium effects in a repeated-measures design, according to Bakeman (2005). \n\n\n8.\tAnything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g., data exclusions, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) \n\nFor missing data we will use the expectation maximization (EM) method in SPSS.

If participants have &gt; 50% data missing or systematic missing data, they will be excluded from the analysis altogether. \n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e26d408edceab01d082e171", "file_name": "Figures.docx", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/dh6gf/files/osfstorage/5e26d408edceab01d082e171", "download": "https://osf.io/download/rfpj7/"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "1e62b3f9f65a62a0e8d11b32eb08204af7413084f0d6417e2e0143dc15a2b96f"}}]}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=b58th", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "b58th", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "b58th", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/gucj9/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "gucj9", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dh6gf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "dh6gf", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/b58th/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/b58th/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=505", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=507", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
