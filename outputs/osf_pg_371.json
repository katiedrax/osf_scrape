The District Court's ruling creates a unique opportunity to investigate the effects\u2014if any\u2014of the Texas voter ID law. Unlike much previous work that relies on self-reported survey responses or aggregated turnout data, we have in the RIDs direct documentation of who goes to the polls without particular forms of identification. Each RID contains the voter's name, as well as a series of check boxes allowing the voter to claim one of eight reasons for not having proper identification. While the RIDs do not provide a clear measure of how many voters SB 14 deterred from voting, the RIDs do contain a wealth of information about people who arrived at the polls lacking identification, and as such can shed light on an important group that has heretofore been impossible to reliably observe: people who clearly wanted to vote, but would have been barred from doing so. We have coded the RIDs (N>16,000) and will merge them with both the Texas voter file and Catalist data.

The District Court's ruling creates a unique opportunity to investigate the effects\u2014if any\u2014of the Texas voter ID law. Unlike much previous work that relies on self-reported survey responses or aggregated turnout data, we have in the RIDs direct documentation of who goes to the polls without particular forms of identification. Each RID contains the voter's name, as well as a series of check boxes allowing the voter to claim one of eight reasons for not having proper identification. While the RIDs do not provide a clear measure of how many voters SB 14 deterred from voting, the RIDs do contain a wealth of information about people who arrived at the polls lacking identification, and as such can shed light on an important group that has heretofore been impossible to reliably observe: people who clearly wanted to vote, but would have been barred from doing so. We have coded the RIDs (N>16,000) and will merge them with both the Texas voter file and Catalist data. Through a pre-registered observational analysis, these data will allow us to ascertain whether, as previous work might suggest, voters without qualifying identification are more likely to be non-White than the broader electorate.", "q16": "1 (The \u201cDistribution\u201d Hypotheses).

We will make a statistical comparison using four t-tests (one for each racial/ethnic group in isolation, and another for the non-White population as a whole), and will repeat the comparison by restricting the sample to counties that filed at least one RID. The Turnout Hypothesis will be tested with a nonparametric difference-in-differences (DID) analysis that examines whether or not individuals identified as not holding identification in 2016 were less likely to vote in the 2014 election, after accounting for trends in pre-ID law turnout propensity at the individual level.

display negative attitudes towards women, while others do not?\u00a0Why are some men unwilling to allow women to access social and economic spaces traditionally dominated by men? And what are the potential consequences of this behaviour to politics, a male-dominated arena that is largely associated with power? These are the questions the current paper seeks to address. \u00a0 To answer these questions, our point of theoretical departure is the notion that individuals\u2019 treatment of women derives from variation in levels of self-esteem. Specifically, we propose that men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem are more likely to hold traditional views about gender roles and appraise women more negatively. We also anticipate that men with this described self-esteem profile will be particularly competitive towards women, seeking to maximize their individual fitness by reducing or removing women as competitors. As a traditionally male-dominated setting largely associated with power, men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem are also expected to electorally reward male candidates only, especially if they hold some level of political ambition. \u00a0 To test these hypotheses, we employ a survey experiment to assess the relationship between individual-level psychological characteristics and social treatment of women. First, we examine whether individuals who display low-implicit or defensive self-esteem are more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 We then employ a randomly assigned experimental component to investigate whether differences in negative or traditional perceptions of women translate into behaviours that are reflective of alternative strategies for social competition\u2014whether men who hold these views seek to maximize their fitness vis-\u00e0-vis others differently, depending on whether the \u201cother\u201d is a man or a woman. The question here is then, why do some men deny women as capable social competitors? \u00a0 Finally, we assess whether these social competitive strategies translate into individuals\u2019 voting strategies by assessing whether men with low or fragile self-esteem are more hesitant to vote for women."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "(this section was updated on April 13, 2018) \u00a0 Why do certain individuals display negative attitudes towards women, while others do not? H1A: In men, negative or traditional perceptions of women will be correlated with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem. In other words, we expect that men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. We also consider that this relationship might be mediated by two other individual-level factors, namely: social competitiveness and cognitive ability. As such, we also hypothesise: \u00a0 H1A1: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display high levels of social competitiveness. H1A2: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of cognitive ability. We are also interested in the factors that lead women to hold negative or traditional perceptions of women. H1B: In women, negative or traditional perceptions of women will be correlated with low/fragile self-esteem, but not defensive self-esteem. In other words, we expect that women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. We also consider that this relationship might be mediated by three other individual-level factors, namely: self-efficacy, general competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility. As such, we also hypothesise: \u00a0 H1B1: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of self-efficacy.

Why are some men unwilling to allow women to access social and economic spaces traditionally dominated by men? H2: Men with low self-esteem will be particularly competitive towards women, seeking to maximize their individual fitness by reducing or removing women as competitors. Given our research design, this means that we expect that: compared to cues about a successful man, cues about the success of a woman will negatively affect the self-esteem of men who have low-implicit or defensive self-esteem. What are the potential consequences of this behaviour to politics, a male-dominated arena that is largely associated with power? H3: Men with low self-esteem will be less likely to support women occupying positions of power; as such, men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be less likely to have voted for women in the past, as well as more hesitant to vote for women in the future."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "(this section was updated on April 13, 2018) \u00a0 Data Collection This study adopts a three-step research approach, in which we: 1) assess individuals\u2019 perceptions of women; 2) estimate individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem and, 3) analyse whether individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem and its expectedly correlated perceptions of women are associated with individuals\u2019 competitive behaviour or cognitive flexibility.\u00a0 \u00a0 Data for all three steps will be collected through an online survey hosted by Qualtrics. For the project, participants will be recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Sample will be restricted to US residents over the age of 18. To motivate recruitment, each participant will be given a direct $0.50 payment as well as be entered into a draw for one of 20 cash prizes of $15.00 each. Prizes will be awarded to participants as Amazon Gift cards. \u00a0 The survey will be composed of a combination of traditional survey elements to measure participants\u2019 demographics and backgrounds (including their explicit views towards women, cognitive abilities, and self-reported self-esteem); and a two-step Implicit Association Test (IAT) to capture participants\u2019 implicit levels of self-esteem and social competition strategies. \u00a0 Traditional Survey Measures: Prior to the IAT, participants complete a 29-question demographic battery, including sex, age, education, ethnicity, income, religious affiliation, religious observance, political orientation, and voting behaviour. \u00a0 At this stage, participants also complete a three-question measure of cognition flexibility, a Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSE), a self-efficacy measure by Chen et al., 2001[1], measures of dominant competitiveness and general competiveness (Newby and Klein 2014), measures of hostile and benevolent sexism (Glick and Fiske 1996), and a measure of social dominance orientation (Pratto, F., Sidanius, J., Stallworth, L. M., & Malle, B. F. 1994). \u00a0 Post-IAT, participants are invited to complete three additional batteries designed to capture ideological differences: 1) an eight-question measure of right-wing populist attitudes (modified from Schneider 2008), a Tripartite measure of conservatism (Duckitt et al. 2010), and a multi-dimensional measure of social values (Smith et al. 2013). \u00a0 Variables are coded as following: \u00a0 Sex is assessed as a binary response variable in which Male =0, Female =1. \u00a0 Age is a continuous variable. \u00a0 Political orientation is measured as a 7-point scale that ranges from -3 (very liberal) to 3 (very conservative) and in which 0 corresponds to \u201cneutral\u201d. \u00a0 Past vote for women is a variable coded based on respondents\u2019 answer to the question \u201chave you ever voted for a woman for any political office?\u201d It gives respondents the option of selecting up to six offices; as such, the variable ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 means that a respondent has never voted for a woman and 6 means that a respondent voted for a woman for all six types of offices listed. \u00a0 Prospective vote for women is a variable coded based on respondents\u2019 answer to the question \u201cif given the opportunity, would you vote for a female candidate?\u201d The question is only displayed to those who never voted for women in the past. The variable ranges from 0 to 4, in which 0 refers to \u201cNo, I would prefer not to,\u201d 1=\u201cI would vote for a woman for some offices, but not others,\u201d 2=\u201cMaybe,\u201d 3=\u201cYes,\u201d and 4 is assigned to those who have voted for a woman in the past.\u00a0 \u00a0 Cognitive flexibility is measured on a continuous 4-point scale, based on the outcome of three problem solving tasks.\u00a0 \u00a0 Explicit self-esteem is assessed in response to the question \u201cOverall, would you say you are a person who has a high sense of self-esteem?\u201d The question is measured as a continuous variable based on 7-point self-report Likert scale. \u00a0The scale ranges from -3 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree) and in which 0 corresponds to \u201cneutral\u201d. \u00a0 Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. As an alternative measure of self-esteem participants also completed a Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES, Rosenberg 1965). The RSES captures explicit self-esteem as a continuous composite measure 10 questions on a 4-point scale. \u00a0 Self-efficacy scale. As an alternative measure of self-evaluation individual participants also completed a measure of self-efficacy (Chen et al. 2001). The scale is based on a continuous composite measure using 8 questions measured on a 5-point Likert scale. \u00a0 Competitiveness is measured as a continuous composite variable based on a 25-question measure, transformed into a 5-point Likert scale (Newby and Klein 2014). This measure breaks into two subgroups: General Competiveness (12 questions) Dominant Competiveness (13 questions) \u00a0 Hostile and Benevolent Sexism is a continuous composite measure based on 22 questions, transformed into a 6-point scale. This measure breaks down into two main subcategories: Hostile Sexism (11 questions) Benevolent Sexism (11 questions) Protective Paternalism (4 questions) Complementary Gender Differentiation (3 questions) Heterosexual Intimacy (4 questions) \u00a0 Social Dominance Orientation is a continuous composite measure based on 14 questions, transformed into a 7-point Likert-scale (Pratto et al., 1994) \u00a0 IAT and Experimental Component: After answering a series of demographic questions, participants will be asked to complete two IAT tests. Following Karpinski, participants first complete an \u201cunspecified-other\u201d IAT in which they are asked to associate positive and negative terminology with themselves and with another unspecified individual. Next, participants are randomly assigned to complete one of two specified-other IATs. For one group of respondents, the \u201cother\u201d is a specified highly successful male, and for a second group of respondents, the specified \u201cother\u201d is a highly successful female. \u00a0 Unspecified-other IAT: For this IAT, the evaluative dimension will be labelled as \u201cpleasant\u201d and \u201cunpleasant\u201d and the self-dimension will be labelled \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d. Five target words will be used for each category. \u00a0 Pleasant: Smart; Capable; Success; Worthy; Proud Unpleasant: Dumb; Useless; Failure; Inept; Ashamed \u00a0 Self: I; Me; My; Myself. Mine Other: Them; Their; They; Themselves; Its \u00a0 Specified-other IAT: For this IAT, the evaluative dimension will be the same as the unspecified-other IAT. The difference is that in this IAT the \u201cother\u201d will be given a specific identity. Specification of the other is done in two ways: by providing respondents with a short description of the identity of one of two individuals (one female and one male) and then by employing the respective individual\u2019s name and gender pronouns. In Treatment 1, the gender will be female, as indicated by the name \u201cBarbara\u201d. In Treatment 2, the gender will be male, as indicated by the name \u201cRobert\u201d. Assignment to one of the two specified-other IATs is done through complete random assignment. \u00a0 Before the specified-other IAT, participants will be instructed as follows: \u00a0 \u201cIn a few moments, you will be asked to complete the second half of the experiment. As in the first part you just completed, you will be assigning attributes to yourself and to another person. However, unlike in the first part, where the \u201cother\u201d was an unspecified individual, the other person you are asked to evaluate in the upcoming activity is real. \u00a0 On the next page, you will read the description of this real person.

Mine Other: Him; His; Himself; Theirself; Robert \u00a0 We employ IAT results to code the following variables: \u00a0 Implicit self-esteem is a continuous variable measured as respondents\u2019 standardized D-scores in the unspecified-other IAT. D-scores are constructed using the code provided by the IATgen package. The package uses the standard IAT procedures outlined by Greenwald et al. 2003; and Lane et al., 2007 (see Carpenter et al., 2017 for full details on the IATgen package). Data are analyzed within subjects. A standardized difference score (D-score) is calculated for each participant. D-scores have a potential range of -2 to 2. A D-score of 0 means that an individual subject was equally fast in both conditions, with no implicit preference. A positive-D-score indicates an individual is faster in the compatible block (seeing themselves as implicitly good); a negative D-score indicates an individual is faster in the incompatible block (seeing the other as implicitly good). Following standard practices within psychology, D-scores of implicit self-esteem can be interpreted as follows: Very low implicit self-esteem (<-0.65) Low implicit self-esteem (-0.35/-0.64) Moderately low implicit self-esteem (-0.15/-0.34) Moderately high implicit self-esteem (0.15/0.34) High implicit self-esteem (0.35/0.64) Very high implicit self-esteem (>0.65) \u00a0 Defensive self-esteem refers to individuals with high explicit self-esteem, but low implicit self-esteem. The variable is constructed as a categorical variable which consists of individuals with high explicit self-esteem on the self-report measure, but low implicit self-esteem on the unspecified-other IAT. As above, following established practice for the interpretations of an IAT in psychology, we define low-implicit self-esteem based on three levels of significance (-0.15, -0.35, -0.65). Explicit self-esteem is measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Defensive self-esteem is therefore modelled based on the following: Very high explicit (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.65) High explicit (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.65) Low explicit (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.65) \u00a0 \u00a0 Statistical Analyses: \u00a0 H1A: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 H1B: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 We test these hypotheses through a series of standard OLS regression models with robust confidence intervals. We measure attitudes towards women as a continuous variable capturing hostile and benevolent sexism (as per the battery developed by Glick and Fiske 1996). We are interested in heterogeneous effects based on sex, so we test each model for two samples: one restricted to male respondents and another restricted to female respondents. Model specifications will include the following independent variables: \u00a0 Regression Model 1: Implicit self-esteem Model A1: Implicit self-esteem Model A2: Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model A3: Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model A4: Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 2: Defensive self-esteem #1 Model B1: Explicit self-esteem Model B2: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem Model B3: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model B4: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model B5: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 3: Defensive self-esteem #2 (Explicit based on a Rosenberg Scale) Model C1: Rosenberg Scale Model C2: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem Model C3: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model C4: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model C5: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem, competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 4: Self-Efficacy Model D1: Self-Efficacy Model D2: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem Model D3: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model D4: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model D5: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 We also run robustness checks with controls for age, race, political orientation, educational background, and income. \u00a0 H2: Compared to cues about a successful man, cues about the success of a woman will negatively affect the self-esteem of men who have low-implicit or defensive self-esteem. \u00a0 To test H2, we employ a series of one-sided T-tests. These tests assess whether individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem are affected depending on whether they were assigned to take the female (Treatment 1) or male (Treatment 2) versions of the specified-other IAT. Our dependent variable is thus the difference between participants\u2019 scores in the specified-other and unspecified-other IATs (i.e., specified-other D-score minus unspecified-other D-score). \u00a0 As is common practice in experimental research, we begin our analysis with an overall test of differences in means between Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 groups. \u00a0 As we are predominantly interested in heterogeneous effects, we also sub-divide our sample into specific sub-groups and conduct the same T-tests: Sex (male, female) implicit self-esteem (men with low-implicit self-esteem, men with high implicit self-esteem) (see coding as above) Defensive self-esteem (men with low-defensive self-esteem, men with high defensive self-esteem) (see coding as above) \u00a0 Amendment: In a previous iteration of this proposal, we considered using a heterogeneous model to compare the difference in means between groups. This proposed model also contained a series of control variables. Upon further consideration, we believe that this model introduces a necessary level of complexity without sufficiently contributing to the evaluation of the core hypotheses. Consequently, we will analyse our statistical results directly through a series of T-tests. The decision to adjust our statistical approach was made prior to the review of any data collected for this study. \u00a0 H3: Men with low/damaged self-esteem will be less likely to support women occupying positions of power. \u00a0 We test these hypotheses using two regression models with robust confidence intervals, a general linearized regression (GLM), and an ordered logit regression. We measure respondents\u2019 support for women occupying positions of power with two variables: past vote for women (GLM) and prospective vote for women (ordered logit). Model specifications will include the following independent variables: \u00a0 Regression Model 1: Implicit self-esteem Model A1: Sex, Implicit self-esteem Model A2: Sex, Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model A3: Sex, Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model A4: Sex, Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 2: Defensive self-esteem #1 Model B1: Sex, Explicit self-esteem Model B2: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem Model B3: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model B4: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model B5: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 3: Defensive self-esteem #2 (Explicit based on a Rosenberg Scale) Model C1: Sex, Rosenberg Scale Model C2: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem Model C3: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model C4: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model C5: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem, competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 4: Self-Efficacy Model D1: Sex, Self-Efficacy Model D2: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem Model D3: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model D4: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model D5: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 We also run robustness checks with controls for age, race, political orientation, educational background, and income. \u00a0 [1] Self-efficacy is defined as \u201cbeliefs in one\u2019s capabilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action needed to meet given situational demands\u201d (Wood & Bandura, 1989, p. 408, in Chen et al., 2001, p 62). \u00a0"}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "United States"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "N=600+; 2-Sample, 1-Sided Statistical Power Test.

And what are the potential consequences of this behaviour to politics, a male-dominated arena that is largely associated with power? These are the questions the current paper seeks to address. \u00a0 To answer these questions, our point of theoretical departure is the notion that individuals\u2019 treatment of women derives from variation in levels of self-esteem. Specifically, we propose that men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem are more likely to hold traditional views about gender roles and appraise women more negatively. We also anticipate that men with this described self-esteem profile will be particularly competitive towards women, seeking to maximize their individual fitness by reducing or removing women as competitors. As a traditionally male-dominated setting largely associated with power, men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem are also expected to electorally reward male candidates only, especially if they hold some level of political ambition. \u00a0 To test these hypotheses, we employ a survey experiment to assess the relationship between individual-level psychological characteristics and social treatment of women. First, we examine whether individuals who display low-implicit or defensive self-esteem are more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 We then employ a randomly assigned experimental component to investigate whether differences in negative or traditional perceptions of women translate into behaviours that are reflective of alternative strategies for social competition\u2014whether men who hold these views seek to maximize their fitness vis-\u00e0-vis others differently, depending on whether the \u201cother\u201d is a man or a woman. The question here is then, why do some men deny women as capable social competitors? \u00a0 Finally, we assess whether these social competitive strategies translate into individuals\u2019 voting strategies by assessing whether men with low or fragile self-esteem are more hesitant to vote for women.", "q16": "(this section was updated on April 13, 2018) \u00a0 Why do certain individuals display negative attitudes towards women, while others do not? H1A: In men, negative or traditional perceptions of women will be correlated with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem. In other words, we expect that men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. We also consider that this relationship might be mediated by two other individual-level factors, namely: social competitiveness and cognitive ability. As such, we also hypothesise: \u00a0 H1A1: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display high levels of social competitiveness. H1A2: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of cognitive ability. We are also interested in the factors that lead women to hold negative or traditional perceptions of women. H1B: In women, negative or traditional perceptions of women will be correlated with low/fragile self-esteem, but not defensive self-esteem. In other words, we expect that women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. We also consider that this relationship might be mediated by three other individual-level factors, namely: self-efficacy, general competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility. As such, we also hypothesise: \u00a0 H1B1: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of self-efficacy. H1B2: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of general competitiveness. H1B3: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women, particularly if they display low levels of cognitive flexibility. Why are some men unwilling to allow women to access social and economic spaces traditionally dominated by men? H2: Men with low self-esteem will be particularly competitive towards women, seeking to maximize their individual fitness by reducing or removing women as competitors. Given our research design, this means that we expect that: compared to cues about a successful man, cues about the success of a woman will negatively affect the self-esteem of men who have low-implicit or defensive self-esteem. What are the potential consequences of this behaviour to politics, a male-dominated arena that is largely associated with power? H3: Men with low self-esteem will be less likely to support women occupying positions of power; as such, men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be less likely to have voted for women in the past, as well as more hesitant to vote for women in the future.", "q17": "(this section was updated on April 13, 2018) \u00a0 Data Collection This study adopts a three-step research approach, in which we: 1) assess individuals\u2019 perceptions of women; 2) estimate individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem and, 3) analyse whether individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem and its expectedly correlated perceptions of women are associated with individuals\u2019 competitive behaviour or cognitive flexibility.\u00a0 \u00a0 Data for all three steps will be collected through an online survey hosted by Qualtrics. For the project, participants will be recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). Sample will be restricted to US residents over the age of 18. To motivate recruitment, each participant will be given a direct $0.50 payment as well as be entered into a draw for one of 20 cash prizes of $15.00 each. Prizes will be awarded to participants as Amazon Gift cards. \u00a0 The survey will be composed of a combination of traditional survey elements to measure participants\u2019 demographics and backgrounds (including their explicit views towards women, cognitive abilities, and self-reported self-esteem); and a two-step Implicit Association Test (IAT) to capture participants\u2019 implicit levels of self-esteem and social competition strategies. \u00a0 Traditional Survey Measures: Prior to the IAT, participants complete a 29-question demographic battery, including sex, age, education, ethnicity, income, religious affiliation, religious observance, political orientation, and voting behaviour. \u00a0 At this stage, participants also complete a three-question measure of cognition flexibility, a Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSE), a self-efficacy measure by Chen et al., 2001[1], measures of dominant competitiveness and general competiveness (Newby and Klein 2014), measures of hostile and benevolent sexism (Glick and Fiske 1996), and a measure of social dominance orientation (Pratto, F., Sidanius, J., Stallworth, L. M., & Malle, B. F. 1994). \u00a0 Post-IAT, participants are invited to complete three additional batteries designed to capture ideological differences: 1) an eight-question measure of right-wing populist attitudes (modified from Schneider 2008), a Tripartite measure of conservatism (Duckitt et al. 2010), and a multi-dimensional measure of social values (Smith et al. 2013). \u00a0 Variables are coded as following: \u00a0 Sex is assessed as a binary response variable in which Male =0, Female =1. \u00a0 Age is a continuous variable. \u00a0 Political orientation is measured as a 7-point scale that ranges from -3 (very liberal) to 3 (very conservative) and in which 0 corresponds to \u201cneutral\u201d. \u00a0 Past vote for women is a variable coded based on respondents\u2019 answer to the question \u201chave you ever voted for a woman for any political office?\u201d It gives respondents the option of selecting up to six offices; as such, the variable ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 means that a respondent has never voted for a woman and 6 means that a respondent voted for a woman for all six types of offices listed. \u00a0 Prospective vote for women is a variable coded based on respondents\u2019 answer to the question \u201cif given the opportunity, would you vote for a female candidate?\u201d The question is only displayed to those who never voted for women in the past. The variable ranges from 0 to 4, in which 0 refers to \u201cNo, I would prefer not to,\u201d 1=\u201cI would vote for a woman for some offices, but not others,\u201d 2=\u201cMaybe,\u201d 3=\u201cYes,\u201d and 4 is assigned to those who have voted for a woman in the past.\u00a0 \u00a0 Cognitive flexibility is measured on a continuous 4-point scale, based on the outcome of three problem solving tasks.\u00a0 \u00a0 Explicit self-esteem is assessed in response to the question \u201cOverall, would you say you are a person who has a high sense of self-esteem?\u201d The question is measured as a continuous variable based on 7-point self-report Likert scale. \u00a0The scale ranges from -3 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree) and in which 0 corresponds to \u201cneutral\u201d. \u00a0 Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. As an alternative measure of self-esteem participants also completed a Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES, Rosenberg 1965). The RSES captures explicit self-esteem as a continuous composite measure 10 questions on a 4-point scale. \u00a0 Self-efficacy scale. As an alternative measure of self-evaluation individual participants also completed a measure of self-efficacy (Chen et al. 2001). The scale is based on a continuous composite measure using 8 questions measured on a 5-point Likert scale. \u00a0 Competitiveness is measured as a continuous composite variable based on a 25-question measure, transformed into a 5-point Likert scale (Newby and Klein 2014). This measure breaks into two subgroups: General Competiveness (12 questions) Dominant Competiveness (13 questions) \u00a0 Hostile and Benevolent Sexism is a continuous composite measure based on 22 questions, transformed into a 6-point scale. This measure breaks down into two main subcategories: Hostile Sexism (11 questions) Benevolent Sexism (11 questions) Protective Paternalism (4 questions) Complementary Gender Differentiation (3 questions) Heterosexual Intimacy (4 questions) \u00a0 Social Dominance Orientation is a continuous composite measure based on 14 questions, transformed into a 7-point Likert-scale (Pratto et al., 1994) \u00a0 IAT and Experimental Component: After answering a series of demographic questions, participants will be asked to complete two IAT tests. Following Karpinski, participants first complete an \u201cunspecified-other\u201d IAT in which they are asked to associate positive and negative terminology with themselves and with another unspecified individual. Next, participants are randomly assigned to complete one of two specified-other IATs. For one group of respondents, the \u201cother\u201d is a specified highly successful male, and for a second group of respondents, the specified \u201cother\u201d is a highly successful female. \u00a0 Unspecified-other IAT: For this IAT, the evaluative dimension will be labelled as \u201cpleasant\u201d and \u201cunpleasant\u201d and the self-dimension will be labelled \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d. Five target words will be used for each category. \u00a0 Pleasant: Smart; Capable; Success; Worthy; Proud Unpleasant: Dumb; Useless; Failure; Inept; Ashamed \u00a0 Self: I; Me; My; Myself. Mine Other: Them; Their; They; Themselves; Its \u00a0 Specified-other IAT: For this IAT, the evaluative dimension will be the same as the unspecified-other IAT. The difference is that in this IAT the \u201cother\u201d will be given a specific identity. Specification of the other is done in two ways: by providing respondents with a short description of the identity of one of two individuals (one female and one male) and then by employing the respective individual\u2019s name and gender pronouns. In Treatment 1, the gender will be female, as indicated by the name \u201cBarbara\u201d. In Treatment 2, the gender will be male, as indicated by the name \u201cRobert\u201d. Assignment to one of the two specified-other IATs is done through complete random assignment. \u00a0 Before the specified-other IAT, participants will be instructed as follows: \u00a0 \u201cIn a few moments, you will be asked to complete the second half of the experiment. As in the first part you just completed, you will be assigning attributes to yourself and to another person. However, unlike in the first part, where the \u201cother\u201d was an unspecified individual, the other person you are asked to evaluate in the upcoming activity is real. \u00a0 On the next page, you will read the description of this real person. To avoid potential conflicts with our results, we have withheld their full identity, but provide a short description of their background and accomplishments.\u201d \u00a0 Participants are then randomly allocated to either Treatment 1 or to Treatment 2: \u00a0 Treatment 1: Female Treatment 2: Male Profile: \u201cBarbara is a real person. \u00a0 She is a successful American businesswoman and entrepreneur. After completing University, she started her own business and developed it into a successful Fortune 500 company. Currently, Barbara has a net worth of over $50 Million.\u00a0 \u00a0 As a result of her success, she has been interviewed by numerous television and media outlets about her leadership in business.\u201d Profile: \u201cRobert is a real person. \u00a0 He is a successful American businessman and entrepreneur. After completing University, he started his own business and developed it into a successful Fortune 500 company.

Mine Other: Him; His; Himself; Theirself; Robert \u00a0 We employ IAT results to code the following variables: \u00a0 Implicit self-esteem is a continuous variable measured as respondents\u2019 standardized D-scores in the unspecified-other IAT. D-scores are constructed using the code provided by the IATgen package. The package uses the standard IAT procedures outlined by Greenwald et al. 2003; and Lane et al., 2007 (see Carpenter et al., 2017 for full details on the IATgen package). Data are analyzed within subjects. A standardized difference score (D-score) is calculated for each participant. D-scores have a potential range of -2 to 2. A D-score of 0 means that an individual subject was equally fast in both conditions, with no implicit preference. A positive-D-score indicates an individual is faster in the compatible block (seeing themselves as implicitly good); a negative D-score indicates an individual is faster in the incompatible block (seeing the other as implicitly good). Following standard practices within psychology, D-scores of implicit self-esteem can be interpreted as follows: Very low implicit self-esteem (<-0.65) Low implicit self-esteem (-0.35/-0.64) Moderately low implicit self-esteem (-0.15/-0.34) Moderately high implicit self-esteem (0.15/0.34) High implicit self-esteem (0.35/0.64) Very high implicit self-esteem (>0.65) \u00a0 Defensive self-esteem refers to individuals with high explicit self-esteem, but low implicit self-esteem. The variable is constructed as a categorical variable which consists of individuals with high explicit self-esteem on the self-report measure, but low implicit self-esteem on the unspecified-other IAT. As above, following established practice for the interpretations of an IAT in psychology, we define low-implicit self-esteem based on three levels of significance (-0.15, -0.35, -0.65). Explicit self-esteem is measured on a 7-point Likert scale. Defensive self-esteem is therefore modelled based on the following: Very high explicit (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 7, Implicit -0.65) High explicit (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 6-7, Implicit -0.65) Low explicit (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.15) (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.35) (Explicit 5-7, Implicit -0.65) \u00a0 \u00a0 Statistical Analyses: \u00a0 H1A: Men with low/fragile or defensive self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 H1B: Women with low/fragile self-esteem will be more likely to hold negative or traditional attitudes towards women. \u00a0 We test these hypotheses through a series of standard OLS regression models with robust confidence intervals. We measure attitudes towards women as a continuous variable capturing hostile and benevolent sexism (as per the battery developed by Glick and Fiske 1996). We are interested in heterogeneous effects based on sex, so we test each model for two samples: one restricted to male respondents and another restricted to female respondents. Model specifications will include the following independent variables: \u00a0 Regression Model 1: Implicit self-esteem Model A1: Implicit self-esteem Model A2: Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model A3: Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model A4: Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 2: Defensive self-esteem #1 Model B1: Explicit self-esteem Model B2: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem Model B3: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model B4: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model B5: Explicit*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 3: Defensive self-esteem #2 (Explicit based on a Rosenberg Scale) Model C1: Rosenberg Scale Model C2: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem Model C3: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model C4: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model C5: Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem, competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 4: Self-Efficacy Model D1: Self-Efficacy Model D2: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem Model D3: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model D4: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model D5: Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 We also run robustness checks with controls for age, race, political orientation, educational background, and income. \u00a0 H2: Compared to cues about a successful man, cues about the success of a woman will negatively affect the self-esteem of men who have low-implicit or defensive self-esteem. \u00a0 To test H2, we employ a series of one-sided T-tests. These tests assess whether individuals\u2019 levels of self-esteem are affected depending on whether they were assigned to take the female (Treatment 1) or male (Treatment 2) versions of the specified-other IAT. Our dependent variable is thus the difference between participants\u2019 scores in the specified-other and unspecified-other IATs (i.e., specified-other D-score minus unspecified-other D-score). \u00a0 As is common practice in experimental research, we begin our analysis with an overall test of differences in means between Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 groups. \u00a0 As we are predominantly interested in heterogeneous effects, we also sub-divide our sample into specific sub-groups and conduct the same T-tests: Sex (male, female) implicit self-esteem (men with low-implicit self-esteem, men with high implicit self-esteem) (see coding as above) Defensive self-esteem (men with low-defensive self-esteem, men with high defensive self-esteem) (see coding as above) \u00a0 Amendment: In a previous iteration of this proposal, we considered using a heterogeneous model to compare the difference in means between groups. This proposed model also contained a series of control variables. Upon further consideration, we believe that this model introduces a necessary level of complexity without sufficiently contributing to the evaluation of the core hypotheses. Consequently, we will analyse our statistical results directly through a series of T-tests. The decision to adjust our statistical approach was made prior to the review of any data collected for this study. \u00a0 H3: Men with low/damaged self-esteem will be less likely to support women occupying positions of power. \u00a0 We test these hypotheses using two regression models with robust confidence intervals, a general linearized regression (GLM), and an ordered logit regression. We measure respondents\u2019 support for women occupying positions of power with two variables: past vote for women (GLM) and prospective vote for women (ordered logit). Model specifications will include the following independent variables: \u00a0 Regression Model 1: Implicit self-esteem Model A1: Sex, Implicit self-esteem Model A2: Sex, Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model A3: Sex, Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model A4: Sex, Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 2: Defensive self-esteem #1 Model B1: Sex, Explicit self-esteem Model B2: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem Model B3: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model B4: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model B5: Sex, Explicit*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 3: Defensive self-esteem #2 (Explicit based on a Rosenberg Scale) Model C1: Sex, Rosenberg Scale Model C2: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem Model C3: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model C4: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model C5: Sex, Rosenberg Scale *Implicit self-esteem, competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 Regression Model 4: Self-Efficacy Model D1: Sex, Self-Efficacy Model D2: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem Model D3: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and competitiveness Model D4: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem and cognitive flexibility Model D5: Sex, Self-Efficacy*Implicit self-esteem competitiveness, and cognitive flexibility \u00a0 We also run robustness checks with controls for age, race, political orientation, educational background, and income. \u00a0 [1] Self-efficacy is defined as \u201cbeliefs in one\u2019s capabilities to mobilize the motivation, cognitive resources, and courses of action needed to meet given situational demands\u201d (Wood & Bandura, 1989, p. 408, in Chen et al., 2001, p 62). \u00a0", "q18": "United States", "q19": "N=600+; 2-Sample, 1-Sided Statistical Power Test.
