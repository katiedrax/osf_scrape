Who runs and who wins Tunisia\u2019s municipal elections also matters for medium- and longer- term democratic consolidation and governance, including local engagement and service delivery. Local politicians may use heuristics or be vulnerable to bias when making decisions about which types of constituent demands to prioritize. Using a conjoint experiment, we examine the question of which types of constituent demands are politicians more likely to respond to? -Local development. In addition to responding to constituent demands, local politicians often play a key role in the creation and/or implementation of development projects in their municipality. A significant body of research in political science and economics examines what factors contribute to the selection of one type of development project over another (e.g. Gottlieb et al., 2016 and Olken, 2010). We employ a conjoint experiment to examine: what project-level attributes increase support for the project among local politicians? -Party/list recruitment. In addition to differences in national-level policy platforms and the demographics of their core supporters, parties in Tunisia vary greatly in terms of their institutionalization, organization, and mobilization strategies. These differences are likely to manifest in local elections by shaping parties\u2019 nomination strategies as well as the pool of potential candidates from which they can draw. This is likely to also have important implications for women trying to enter the political sphere. We use a conjoint experiment to examine: what type of attributes make an individual more likely to be selected as a list member? -Marijuana decriminalization. In 2017, the Tunisia government passed legislation to depenalize low-level marijuana offenses; however, civil society activists want further reforms. While the public opinion microfoundations of harsh criminal justice policies is well understood, there is less research on what types of frames solicit greater support for less punitive measures. Using a framing experiment, we test three different frames in order to understand when are political candidates most likely to support criminal justice reform?"}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "For this pre-analysis plan, we focus on the theory and hypotheses related to the four survey experiments embedded in our local election candidate survey in Tunisia. For the theory and hypotheses related to our observational survey data collection, please email us (contact information listed in final section). For full details on our sampling and our survey experiments, see Section 4 (\u201cResearch Strategy\u201d) below. I. Constituent conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a constituent request increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prioritize that request. Government responsiveness, an important aspect of local governance, often varies as a result of politician bias (Broockman and Butler, 2011). Building off of this existing literature, we use a conjoint experiment to examine what type of constituent local political candidates are most likely to be responsive to. The full list of attributes and their associated levels are listed below in section 4.B., but include a constituent\u2019s (A) background, (B) sex, (C) service requested, (D) support, and (E) threat. H1: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by the constituent\u2019s background. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: individual from a local well-known family (most likely to be prioritized) > businessperson > party official > political activist > parent with two children > student (least likely to be prioritized). H2: Given the salience of security and employment issues, candidates will be more likely to prioritize providing assistance with requests related to a crime or providing assistance with a job than to prioritize providing assistance with garbage collection, local roads, and street lighting. [crime (most likely to be prioritized) > job > garbage = roads = lighting (least likely to be prioritized)]. H3: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by who is supporting the constituent. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: came with a letter from the governor (most likely to be prioritized) > has local union support > came with members of civil society > came with family > came alone (least likely to be prioritized). H4: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by the type of threat the constituent makes regarding inaction. In a new democracy, such as Tunisia, local elites and authorities retain significant power, while many politicians and voters have less experience with an electoral sanctioning mechanism. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: visit the governor if this issue is not addressed (most likely to be prioritized) > protest outside the municipal council if this issue is not addressed > not vote for you in the future if this issue is not addressed > be grateful for your help (least likely to be prioritized). H5: Because we expect that politicians in general will be more responsive under higher levels of competition (Binzer and Klemmensen, 2008), we anticipate that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the various attribute levels will differ significantly between municipalities with higher levels of political contestation (measured as the number of parties competing in the municipality) and those with lower levels of political contestation. Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of our conjoint experiments. Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the responsiveness of candidates is a product of the interaction between (a) the constituent attributes manipulated by the experiment, (b) the characteristics of the candidates themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H6: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents whose background or support comes from a powerful group within the municipality: A-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal families\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is from a \u201cwell-known family.\u201d B-Candidates who answered that \u201ccivil society\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is (a) a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d and/or who (b) is supported by \u201cmembers of a local civil society organization.\u201d C-Candidates who answered that \u201cunions or professional associations\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201clocal union.\u201d D-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal business owners\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cbusinessperson.\u201d E-Candidates who answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201cgovernor.\u201d H7: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents who share their background, are supported by someone who shares their background, or share the same sex: A-Candidates who are members of a civil society group will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is (a) a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d or who is (b) supported by \u201cmembers of a local civil society organization.\u201d B-Candidates who are members of a union will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201clocal union.\u201d C-Candidates who are members of a political party will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cparty official.\u201d D-Candidates who are parents will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cparent with two children.\u201d E-Candidates who are students will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cstudent.\u201d F-Candidates who are female are more likely to prioritize a constituent who is female. H8: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents whose threats are credible based on their background, support, and other municipal characteristics: A-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cprotest outside the municipal council\u201d if (a) the constituent is a \u201clocal activist\u201d or (b) the municipality has a history of violence and unrest. B-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cvisit the governor\u201d if (a) the constituent also has the governor\u2019s support, or (b) the candidate answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence in the municipality. C-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cnot vote for you in the future\u201d in municipalities with higher levels of pre-treatment competition, measured by (a) the number of lists and (b) 2014 vote margins. II. Local development conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a local development proposal increase or decrease the probability that a candidate will choose to support it. Tunisia\u2019s new decentralization law and revised center-local fiscal transfer system will require deeper involvement from citizens in how municipalities spend their budgets. This conjoint experiment is designed to test which aspects of a project proposal\u2014including (a) the type of good provided, (b) who is making the proposal, (c) how much the project costs, and (d) which entities may provide co-financing for the project\u2014are likely to matter most to politicians with fixed resources adjudicating between projects. Better understanding candidates\u2019 decision-making processes will have implications for the expected outcomes of local budgeting processes. H1: All else equal, candidates will prefer types of projects that are (a) more likely to benefit the lower class (local roads in poorest area of town, street lighting in poorest area of town, jobs for those who did not attend university) over those that are (b) more likely to benefit the middle class (local roads in center of town, street lighting in center of town, jobs for people who completed university). H2: All else equal, candidates will prefer projects proposed by (a) leaders of their party/list, and (b) \u201cmore organized\u201d civil society (union leaders, and local business associations) over projects proposed by (c) \u201cless organized\u201d civil society (youth and local activists, 500 community members who signed a petition). H3: All else equal, candidates will prefer cheaper projects to more expensive ones: 5,000 TND > 10,000 TND > 15,000 TND > 20,000 TND > 25,000 TND. H4: All else equal, candidates will prefer projects that receive co-financing from (a) a politically neutral organization (local civil society, GiZ) to those with co-financing from (b) a politically compromised one (World Bank, USAID). H5: We anticipate that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the various attribute levels will differ significantly between (a) municipalities with higher levels of political contestation (measured as the number of parties competing in the municipality and the 2014 vote margins) and those with lower levels of political contestation, and between (b) large and small municipalities. Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of our conjoint experiments. Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the responsiveness of candidates is a product of the interaction between (a) the project attributes manipulated by the experiment, (b) the characteristics of the candidates themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H5. All else equal, candidates will prefer projects (a) proposed by groups of which they are a member or (b) that would benefit groups of which they are a member: A-Candidates who are union members are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201cunion leaders.\u201d B-Candidates who are (a) members of business associations and/or (b) own their own businesses are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201clocal business associations.\u201d C-Candidates who are (a) members of civil society groups, (b) activists, and/or (c) are younger are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201cyouth and local activists.\u201d D-Candidates who are unemployed are more likely to support projects to provide jobs. H6. All else equal, candidates will prefer projects similar to those that they self-identified as high priorities in their municipalities earlier in the survey: A-Candidates who chose \u201cimproving local roads\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cimprove local roads.\u201d B-Candidates who chose \u201cinstalling more lights in public spaces\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cimprove street lighting.\u201d C-Candidates who chose \u201ccreating jobs for locals\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cprovide jobs.\u201d D-Candidates who chose \u201cenhancing local cultural life\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201copen a new cultural center.\u201d III. Candidate selection conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what attributes of a potential candidate increase or decrease the probability that political gatekeepers and candidates will prefer that candidate for their list. In the survey in which this experiment is embedded, we ask the candidates about their role in the construction of the candidate list. Thus, we will have information on which candidates were also constructors of the list, i.e. political gatekeepers. In the context of this study, the candidates who reported that they played a major role in the construction of the list will be designated as \u201cpolitical gatekeepers.\u201d Thus, one of the central aims of this experiment will be exploring whether there are differences in the selection tendencies of gatekeepers vs. usual candidates. H1: Men are more likely than women to be selected as candidates. H2: In the eyes of the political gatekeepers, men are more likely to attract votes from voters. Therefore, political gatekeepers are more likely to select men as candidates. (Political gatekeepers will be measured by respondents\u2019 self-reported role in the construction of the list. We ask to what extent they were involved in that process for their current list. Gatekeepers are those who respond that they played a major role.) H3: In current Tunisia, corruption is a politically salient issue due to the previous authoritarian regime in which crony capitalism was one of the main pillars of economic management. As a result of this negative legacy, parties aim to attract candidates who have a reputation of being honest and clean. Therefore, both political gatekeepers and less influential candidates will prioritize the reputation of being honest and clean over other personal characteristics (coming from local powerful family, having experience in the union movement, having experience in civil society, having experience in public administration). Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the candidate selection is a product of the interaction between (a) the proposed candidate\u2019s attributes, (b) the characteristics of the candidates (respondents) themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H4: Major parties\u2019 candidate selection strategies will be in line with their larger party-building strategy: A-Candidates and gatekeepers of Ennahda, the Islamist party which is in the process of rebranding itself as a Muslim democratic centrist party, would select people with characteristics such as having civil society experience and public administration experience over people who have experience in the labor union movement and coming from a large local powerful family. B-Candidates and gatekeepers of Nidaa Tounes, the secularist party which is increasingly focused on re-consolidating the forces of the old regime since 2014, would select people with characteristics such as coming from a large local powerful family and public administration experience over people who have experience in the labor union movement and having civil society experience. H5. All else equal, candidates will prefer list members who conform to their expectations of a political leader (as shaped by respondents\u2019 attitudes and beliefs). A-Candidates who are more patriarchal (as measured by responses to questions about whether women are as capable as men to be politicians, etc) are more likely to select men as list members. H6. All else equal, candidates will prefer list members (a) who are also members of groups in which they are a member: A-Candidates who are union members are more likely to select members who have experience in the syndicalist movement. B-Candidates who are (a) members of civil society groups, (b) activists, and/or (c) are younger are more likely to select members who have experience in civil society. C-Candidates who identify with a particular profession are more likely to select members who share that profession (e.g., businessmen will prefer businessmen, farmers will prefer farmers, lawyers will prefer lawyers, etc). D-Candidates who are identify with a particular party and have been with that party for some time are more likely to select members who share party loyalty. H7: All else equal, candidates will be more likely to select list members whose background or support comes from a powerful group within the municipality: A-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal families\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who is from a \u201cwell-known family.\u201d B-Candidates who answered that \u201ccivil society\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in civil society. C-Candidates who answered that \u201cunions or professional associations\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in the syndicalist movement. D-Candidates who answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in public administration. IV. Marijuana decriminalization framing experiment This survey experiment is designed to test whether support or opposition to marijuana decriminalization is affected by the issue framing. Issue framing occurs when a change in the way an issue is presented and discussed generates significant changes of an individual\u2019s opinion on the issue (Chong and Druckman, 2007). In an individual\u2019s attitude formation, framing can influence the valence of issue (by using a frame that places the issue in a positive or negative light) as well as the relative weight of an issue (by using a frame that stresses the issue\u2019s relative importance). For this experiment, we selected three potential frames that are based on news reporting around the issue of marijuana arrests and decriminalization: the problem of prison overcrowding, the problem of police targeting of youth, and the availability of addiction and health treatment, in addition to a control condition. The literature on individual-level preferences with regard to criminal justice tend to emphasize that individuals are motivated by a conception of \u2018just deserts\u2019 for the perpetrator of the crime (Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson, 2002; Carlsmith and Darley, 2008). This \u2018just deserts\u2019 conception of punishment is both retributive and retrospective, in contrast to more utilitarian conceptions of punishment that emphasize the deterrence of future crimes and the overall effectiveness and cost of punishment. In this framework, two of our treatments focus on the utility of punishment: (1) the problem of prison overcrowding and (2) the availability of addiction and health treatment. The prison overcrowding treatment frames Law 52 as having unintended and negative consequences (utilitarian treatment). The addiction services treatment highlights the availability of another path to dealing with the problem that does not have the potential negative consequences of prison sentences and aims at reducing future use (prevention of future harm treatment). The third treatment, which uses a frame that emphasizes the problem of police targeting of youth, underlines that the arrest may not have been just in the first place (challenging the \u2018just deserts\u2019 treatment). We will examine the following four hypotheses: H1: All of the treatments will significantly increase the probability of respondent support for marijuana decriminalization relative to the control condition. All of the experimental frames highlight a positive aspect of or positive outcome related to marijuana decriminalization. H2: The addiction services frame (prevention of future harm treatment) will significantly increase the probability of respondent support for marijuana decriminalization relative to the prison overcrowding and the police targeting frames. H3: There will be no significant difference between the effect of the prison overcrowding frame and the police targeting frame in the overall sample. However, there will be strong differences in the effects of these two treatments among older and younger respondents. The effect of the prison overcrowding treatment will be stronger among older respondents, while the effect of the police targeting of youth treatment will be stronger among younger respondents. This is because the effect of the police targeting of youth treatment will be most activated among younger cohorts that identify with those targeted. H4: We expect greater attitudinal changes among those with weaker policy commitments (as measured by weak partisan ties, less political/policy experience, and younger in age). We readily acknowledge that exposing respondents to only one frame one time rather than competing frames or the same frame more regularly is an abstraction from the real world. Our main goals in this project, however, are to (1) measure overall support for marijuana decriminalization, (2) examine whether these views are malleable at all, and (3) determine what types of frames change an individual\u2019s opinion relative to a control group. Accordingly, this type of single frame design is most appropriate for these research questions."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We use three conjoint experiments and one framing experiment to gain additional analytic leverage on several questions of interest. There is a growing body of research in political science that employs conjoint experiments to estimate the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of multi-dimensional decisions, such as which candidate voters prefer or which policies voters prefer [On candidates see: Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto (2014); Franchino and Zucchini (2015); Carnes and Lupu (2016); Horiuchi, Smith, and Yamamoto (2016); and Kirkland and Coppock (2017). On policy see: Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015); Bechtel and Scheve (2013); and Blackman (2018).]. In all of our conjoint experiments, the political candidates were asked to choose between two options, the attributes of which were fully randomized. With the randomization, we can identify the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of each attribute\u2019s potential values (Hainmueller et al., 2014). In the Tunisia Candidate Election Survey, we include a number of measures of personal and professional background, general attitudes, and policy preferences. In addition, we include four survey experiments. The first two experiments (constituent conjoint and local development conjoint) examine politician responsiveness and policy preferences. The third experiment, candidate selection conjoint, examines the candidate selection process, while the fourth manipulates the framing of a survey question on marijuana decriminalization in order to examine how these different frames change support or opposition to decriminalization. All respondents receive both the candidate selection conjoint and the marijuana decriminalization framing survey experiments. Respondents are randomly assigned to see either the constituent conjoint or the local development conjoint. I. Constituent conjoint. This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a constituent request increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prioritize that request. Half of the survey respondents will answer this question for four pairs of development project profiles.

II. Local development conjoint. This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a local development proposal increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prefer it. Half of the survey respondents will answer this question for four pairs of development project profiles. Prompt: After you are a member of to the municipal council, you will have the opportunity to vote for or against different project proposals for your municipality.

This survey experiment is designed to estimate what attributes of a potential candidate increase or decrease the probability that political candidates will prefer that candidate for their list. Each respondent will answer this question for three pairs of potential candidates. Prompt: During the preparations for elections, important decisions have been made about who will be included in the lists. Imagine that these two people have been suggested to you to be included in your list. Which person would you contact first to offer a place in your list? Attributes: (1) Party affiliation: 1.

Marijuana decriminalization framing. This survey experiment is designed to test whether support or opposition to marijuana decriminalization is affected by the issue framing. In this experiment, respondents are randomly placed into one of four experimental conditions: control, prison overcrowding, police targeting of youth, and availability of addiction and health treatment. The experimental conditions are as follows: 1. Control: [Experimental Framing left blank] 2. Prison Overcrowding: \u201cGiven recent efforts to decrease prison overcrowding\u2026\u201d 3. Police Targeting: \u201cGiven recent reports of police targeting of youth\u2026\u201d 4. Availability of addiction services: \u201cGiven recent efforts to increase the availability of addiction treatment\u2026\u201d The question is as follows: [Experimental Framing], which is closest to your opinion regarding Law 52 and the efforts to decriminalize marijuana in Tunisia?

Who runs and who wins Tunisia\u2019s municipal elections also matters for medium- and longer- term democratic consolidation and governance, including local engagement and service delivery. Local politicians may use heuristics or be vulnerable to bias when making decisions about which types of constituent demands to prioritize. Using a conjoint experiment, we examine the question of which types of constituent demands are politicians more likely to respond to? -Local development. In addition to responding to constituent demands, local politicians often play a key role in the creation and/or implementation of development projects in their municipality. A significant body of research in political science and economics examines what factors contribute to the selection of one type of development project over another (e.g. Gottlieb et al., 2016 and Olken, 2010). We employ a conjoint experiment to examine: what project-level attributes increase support for the project among local politicians? -Party/list recruitment. In addition to differences in national-level policy platforms and the demographics of their core supporters, parties in Tunisia vary greatly in terms of their institutionalization, organization, and mobilization strategies. These differences are likely to manifest in local elections by shaping parties\u2019 nomination strategies as well as the pool of potential candidates from which they can draw. This is likely to also have important implications for women trying to enter the political sphere. We use a conjoint experiment to examine: what type of attributes make an individual more likely to be selected as a list member? -Marijuana decriminalization. In 2017, the Tunisia government passed legislation to depenalize low-level marijuana offenses; however, civil society activists want further reforms. While the public opinion microfoundations of harsh criminal justice policies is well understood, there is less research on what types of frames solicit greater support for less punitive measures. Using a framing experiment, we test three different frames in order to understand when are political candidates most likely to support criminal justice reform?", "q16": "For this pre-analysis plan, we focus on the theory and hypotheses related to the four survey experiments embedded in our local election candidate survey in Tunisia. For the theory and hypotheses related to our observational survey data collection, please email us (contact information listed in final section). For full details on our sampling and our survey experiments, see Section 4 (\u201cResearch Strategy\u201d) below. I. Constituent conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a constituent request increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prioritize that request. Government responsiveness, an important aspect of local governance, often varies as a result of politician bias (Broockman and Butler, 2011). Building off of this existing literature, we use a conjoint experiment to examine what type of constituent local political candidates are most likely to be responsive to. The full list of attributes and their associated levels are listed below in section 4.B., but include a constituent\u2019s (A) background, (B) sex, (C) service requested, (D) support, and (E) threat. H1: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by the constituent\u2019s background. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: individual from a local well-known family (most likely to be prioritized) > businessperson > party official > political activist > parent with two children > student (least likely to be prioritized). H2: Given the salience of security and employment issues, candidates will be more likely to prioritize providing assistance with requests related to a crime or providing assistance with a job than to prioritize providing assistance with garbage collection, local roads, and street lighting. [crime (most likely to be prioritized) > job > garbage = roads = lighting (least likely to be prioritized)]. H3: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by who is supporting the constituent. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: came with a letter from the governor (most likely to be prioritized) > has local union support > came with members of civil society > came with family > came alone (least likely to be prioritized). H4: The likelihood that a political candidate prioritizes a constituent will be determined in part by the type of threat the constituent makes regarding inaction. In a new democracy, such as Tunisia, local elites and authorities retain significant power, while many politicians and voters have less experience with an electoral sanctioning mechanism. The probability of being prioritized will decrease in the following order: visit the governor if this issue is not addressed (most likely to be prioritized) > protest outside the municipal council if this issue is not addressed > not vote for you in the future if this issue is not addressed > be grateful for your help (least likely to be prioritized). H5: Because we expect that politicians in general will be more responsive under higher levels of competition (Binzer and Klemmensen, 2008), we anticipate that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the various attribute levels will differ significantly between municipalities with higher levels of political contestation (measured as the number of parties competing in the municipality) and those with lower levels of political contestation. Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of our conjoint experiments. Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the responsiveness of candidates is a product of the interaction between (a) the constituent attributes manipulated by the experiment, (b) the characteristics of the candidates themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H6: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents whose background or support comes from a powerful group within the municipality: A-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal families\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is from a \u201cwell-known family.\u201d B-Candidates who answered that \u201ccivil society\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is (a) a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d and/or who (b) is supported by \u201cmembers of a local civil society organization.\u201d C-Candidates who answered that \u201cunions or professional associations\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201clocal union.\u201d D-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal business owners\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cbusinessperson.\u201d E-Candidates who answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201cgovernor.\u201d H7: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents who share their background, are supported by someone who shares their background, or share the same sex: A-Candidates who are members of a civil society group will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is (a) a \u201cpolitical activist\u201d or who is (b) supported by \u201cmembers of a local civil society organization.\u201d B-Candidates who are members of a union will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is supported by the \u201clocal union.\u201d C-Candidates who are members of a political party will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cparty official.\u201d D-Candidates who are parents will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cparent with two children.\u201d E-Candidates who are students will be more likely to prioritize a constituent who is a \u201cstudent.\u201d F-Candidates who are female are more likely to prioritize a constituent who is female. H8: All else equal, candidates will be more responsive to constituents whose threats are credible based on their background, support, and other municipal characteristics: A-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cprotest outside the municipal council\u201d if (a) the constituent is a \u201clocal activist\u201d or (b) the municipality has a history of violence and unrest. B-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cvisit the governor\u201d if (a) the constituent also has the governor\u2019s support, or (b) the candidate answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence in the municipality. C-Candidates will be more responsive to constituents who threaten to \u201cnot vote for you in the future\u201d in municipalities with higher levels of pre-treatment competition, measured by (a) the number of lists and (b) 2014 vote margins. II. Local development conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a local development proposal increase or decrease the probability that a candidate will choose to support it. Tunisia\u2019s new decentralization law and revised center-local fiscal transfer system will require deeper involvement from citizens in how municipalities spend their budgets. This conjoint experiment is designed to test which aspects of a project proposal\u2014including (a) the type of good provided, (b) who is making the proposal, (c) how much the project costs, and (d) which entities may provide co-financing for the project\u2014are likely to matter most to politicians with fixed resources adjudicating between projects. Better understanding candidates\u2019 decision-making processes will have implications for the expected outcomes of local budgeting processes. H1: All else equal, candidates will prefer types of projects that are (a) more likely to benefit the lower class (local roads in poorest area of town, street lighting in poorest area of town, jobs for those who did not attend university) over those that are (b) more likely to benefit the middle class (local roads in center of town, street lighting in center of town, jobs for people who completed university). H2: All else equal, candidates will prefer projects proposed by (a) leaders of their party/list, and (b) \u201cmore organized\u201d civil society (union leaders, and local business associations) over projects proposed by (c) \u201cless organized\u201d civil society (youth and local activists, 500 community members who signed a petition). H3: All else equal, candidates will prefer cheaper projects to more expensive ones: 5,000 TND > 10,000 TND > 15,000 TND > 20,000 TND > 25,000 TND. H4: All else equal, candidates will prefer projects that receive co-financing from (a) a politically neutral organization (local civil society, GiZ) to those with co-financing from (b) a politically compromised one (World Bank, USAID). H5: We anticipate that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the various attribute levels will differ significantly between (a) municipalities with higher levels of political contestation (measured as the number of parties competing in the municipality and the 2014 vote margins) and those with lower levels of political contestation, and between (b) large and small municipalities. Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) of our conjoint experiments. Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the responsiveness of candidates is a product of the interaction between (a) the project attributes manipulated by the experiment, (b) the characteristics of the candidates themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H5. All else equal, candidates will prefer projects (a) proposed by groups of which they are a member or (b) that would benefit groups of which they are a member: A-Candidates who are union members are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201cunion leaders.\u201d B-Candidates who are (a) members of business associations and/or (b) own their own businesses are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201clocal business associations.\u201d C-Candidates who are (a) members of civil society groups, (b) activists, and/or (c) are younger are more likely to select projects proposed by \u201cyouth and local activists.\u201d D-Candidates who are unemployed are more likely to support projects to provide jobs. H6. All else equal, candidates will prefer projects similar to those that they self-identified as high priorities in their municipalities earlier in the survey: A-Candidates who chose \u201cimproving local roads\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cimprove local roads.\u201d B-Candidates who chose \u201cinstalling more lights in public spaces\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cimprove street lighting.\u201d C-Candidates who chose \u201ccreating jobs for locals\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201cprovide jobs.\u201d D-Candidates who chose \u201cenhancing local cultural life\u201d as a top priority will be more likely to select projects to \u201copen a new cultural center.\u201d III. Candidate selection conjoint experiment This survey experiment is designed to estimate what attributes of a potential candidate increase or decrease the probability that political gatekeepers and candidates will prefer that candidate for their list. In the survey in which this experiment is embedded, we ask the candidates about their role in the construction of the candidate list. Thus, we will have information on which candidates were also constructors of the list, i.e. political gatekeepers. In the context of this study, the candidates who reported that they played a major role in the construction of the list will be designated as \u201cpolitical gatekeepers.\u201d Thus, one of the central aims of this experiment will be exploring whether there are differences in the selection tendencies of gatekeepers vs. usual candidates. H1: Men are more likely than women to be selected as candidates. H2: In the eyes of the political gatekeepers, men are more likely to attract votes from voters. Therefore, political gatekeepers are more likely to select men as candidates. (Political gatekeepers will be measured by respondents\u2019 self-reported role in the construction of the list. We ask to what extent they were involved in that process for their current list. Gatekeepers are those who respond that they played a major role.) H3: In current Tunisia, corruption is a politically salient issue due to the previous authoritarian regime in which crony capitalism was one of the main pillars of economic management. As a result of this negative legacy, parties aim to attract candidates who have a reputation of being honest and clean. Therefore, both political gatekeepers and less influential candidates will prioritize the reputation of being honest and clean over other personal characteristics (coming from local powerful family, having experience in the union movement, having experience in civil society, having experience in public administration). Furthermore, detailed survey data on candidates will allow us to test a number of hypotheses related to the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Specifically, it will examine the degree to which the candidate selection is a product of the interaction between (a) the proposed candidate\u2019s attributes, (b) the characteristics of the candidates (respondents) themselves, and (c) the characteristics of the municipalities in which they are running: H4: Major parties\u2019 candidate selection strategies will be in line with their larger party-building strategy: A-Candidates and gatekeepers of Ennahda, the Islamist party which is in the process of rebranding itself as a Muslim democratic centrist party, would select people with characteristics such as having civil society experience and public administration experience over people who have experience in the labor union movement and coming from a large local powerful family. B-Candidates and gatekeepers of Nidaa Tounes, the secularist party which is increasingly focused on re-consolidating the forces of the old regime since 2014, would select people with characteristics such as coming from a large local powerful family and public administration experience over people who have experience in the labor union movement and having civil society experience. H5. All else equal, candidates will prefer list members who conform to their expectations of a political leader (as shaped by respondents\u2019 attitudes and beliefs). A-Candidates who are more patriarchal (as measured by responses to questions about whether women are as capable as men to be politicians, etc) are more likely to select men as list members. H6. All else equal, candidates will prefer list members (a) who are also members of groups in which they are a member: A-Candidates who are union members are more likely to select members who have experience in the syndicalist movement. B-Candidates who are (a) members of civil society groups, (b) activists, and/or (c) are younger are more likely to select members who have experience in civil society. C-Candidates who identify with a particular profession are more likely to select members who share that profession (e.g., businessmen will prefer businessmen, farmers will prefer farmers, lawyers will prefer lawyers, etc). D-Candidates who are identify with a particular party and have been with that party for some time are more likely to select members who share party loyalty. H7: All else equal, candidates will be more likely to select list members whose background or support comes from a powerful group within the municipality: A-Candidates who answered that \u201clocal families\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who is from a \u201cwell-known family.\u201d B-Candidates who answered that \u201ccivil society\u201d has \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in civil society. C-Candidates who answered that \u201cunions or professional associations\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in the syndicalist movement. D-Candidates who answered that \u201cthe governor, delegate, and/or sector\u201d have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of influence over local politics will be more likely to select a list member who has experience in public administration. IV. Marijuana decriminalization framing experiment This survey experiment is designed to test whether support or opposition to marijuana decriminalization is affected by the issue framing. Issue framing occurs when a change in the way an issue is presented and discussed generates significant changes of an individual\u2019s opinion on the issue (Chong and Druckman, 2007). In an individual\u2019s attitude formation, framing can influence the valence of issue (by using a frame that places the issue in a positive or negative light) as well as the relative weight of an issue (by using a frame that stresses the issue\u2019s relative importance). For this experiment, we selected three potential frames that are based on news reporting around the issue of marijuana arrests and decriminalization: the problem of prison overcrowding, the problem of police targeting of youth, and the availability of addiction and health treatment, in addition to a control condition. The literature on individual-level preferences with regard to criminal justice tend to emphasize that individuals are motivated by a conception of \u2018just deserts\u2019 for the perpetrator of the crime (Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson, 2002; Carlsmith and Darley, 2008). This \u2018just deserts\u2019 conception of punishment is both retributive and retrospective, in contrast to more utilitarian conceptions of punishment that emphasize the deterrence of future crimes and the overall effectiveness and cost of punishment. In this framework, two of our treatments focus on the utility of punishment: (1) the problem of prison overcrowding and (2) the availability of addiction and health treatment. The prison overcrowding treatment frames Law 52 as having unintended and negative consequences (utilitarian treatment). The addiction services treatment highlights the availability of another path to dealing with the problem that does not have the potential negative consequences of prison sentences and aims at reducing future use (prevention of future harm treatment). The third treatment, which uses a frame that emphasizes the problem of police targeting of youth, underlines that the arrest may not have been just in the first place (challenging the \u2018just deserts\u2019 treatment). We will examine the following four hypotheses: H1: All of the treatments will significantly increase the probability of respondent support for marijuana decriminalization relative to the control condition. All of the experimental frames highlight a positive aspect of or positive outcome related to marijuana decriminalization. H2: The addiction services frame (prevention of future harm treatment) will significantly increase the probability of respondent support for marijuana decriminalization relative to the prison overcrowding and the police targeting frames. H3: There will be no significant difference between the effect of the prison overcrowding frame and the police targeting frame in the overall sample. However, there will be strong differences in the effects of these two treatments among older and younger respondents. The effect of the prison overcrowding treatment will be stronger among older respondents, while the effect of the police targeting of youth treatment will be stronger among younger respondents. This is because the effect of the police targeting of youth treatment will be most activated among younger cohorts that identify with those targeted. H4: We expect greater attitudinal changes among those with weaker policy commitments (as measured by weak partisan ties, less political/policy experience, and younger in age). We readily acknowledge that exposing respondents to only one frame one time rather than competing frames or the same frame more regularly is an abstraction from the real world. Our main goals in this project, however, are to (1) measure overall support for marijuana decriminalization, (2) examine whether these views are malleable at all, and (3) determine what types of frames change an individual\u2019s opinion relative to a control group. Accordingly, this type of single frame design is most appropriate for these research questions.", "q17": "We use three conjoint experiments and one framing experiment to gain additional analytic leverage on several questions of interest. There is a growing body of research in political science that employs conjoint experiments to estimate the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of multi-dimensional decisions, such as which candidate voters prefer or which policies voters prefer [On candidates see: Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto (2014); Franchino and Zucchini (2015); Carnes and Lupu (2016); Horiuchi, Smith, and Yamamoto (2016); and Kirkland and Coppock (2017). On policy see: Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015); Bechtel and Scheve (2013); and Blackman (2018).]. In all of our conjoint experiments, the political candidates were asked to choose between two options, the attributes of which were fully randomized. With the randomization, we can identify the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of each attribute\u2019s potential values (Hainmueller et al., 2014). In the Tunisia Candidate Election Survey, we include a number of measures of personal and professional background, general attitudes, and policy preferences. In addition, we include four survey experiments. The first two experiments (constituent conjoint and local development conjoint) examine politician responsiveness and policy preferences. The third experiment, candidate selection conjoint, examines the candidate selection process, while the fourth manipulates the framing of a survey question on marijuana decriminalization in order to examine how these different frames change support or opposition to decriminalization. All respondents receive both the candidate selection conjoint and the marijuana decriminalization framing survey experiments. Respondents are randomly assigned to see either the constituent conjoint or the local development conjoint. I. Constituent conjoint. This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a constituent request increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prioritize that request. Half of the survey respondents will answer this question for four pairs of development project profiles. Prompt: After you are a member of to the municipal council, you will receive requests for assistance from a variety of people in your municipality regarding issues they are facing. Imagine that two different citizens approach you for assistance on the same day. Here you are presented with the details of the two requests. Which request do you prioritize? Attributes: (1) Citizen: 1. local student 2. local parent with two children 3. local businessperson 4. local party official 5. local political activist 6. individual from a local well-known family (2) Sex: 1. Male 2. Female (3) Service: 1. better garbage collection 2. improvements to local roads 3. better street lighting 4. assistance addressing a crime that occurred locally 5. assistance with job (4) Support: This person\u2026 1. came alone 2. came with members of a local civil society organization 3. has local union support 4. came with family 5. came with letter from governor (5) This person says that they will: 1. protest outside the municipal council if this issue is not addressed 2. visit the governor if this issue is not addressed 3. not vote for you in the future if this issue is not addressed 4. be grateful for your help Question: Which request do you prioritize? II. Local development conjoint. This survey experiment is designed to estimate what aspects of a local development proposal increase or decrease the probability that a political candidate will prefer it. Half of the survey respondents will answer this question for four pairs of development project profiles. Prompt: After you are a member of to the municipal council, you will have the opportunity to vote for or against different project proposals for your municipality. Imagine that you are presented with two different development projects for your municipality and can only support one of them. Below you are presented with the details of the two projects. Which project do you prefer for your municipality? Attributes: (1) Project: 1. improve local roads in the poorest area of town 2. Improve local roads in the center of town 3. improve street lighting in the center of town 4. Improve street lighting in the poorest area of town 5. provide jobs to people who did not attend university 6. provide jobs to people who completed university 7. Open a new cultural center (2) Support: This project was proposed by\u2026 1. Members of your party or movement 2. Local union leaders 3. Local business association 4. youth and local activists 5. Over 500 members of the community who signed a petition (3) Cost: the municipality will have to pay 1. 5.000 TND for the project 2. 10.000 TND for the project 3. 15.000 TND for the project 4. 20.000 TND for the project 5. 25.000 TND for the project (4) Additional finances: If the project is funded, it will receive additional support from 1.

United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Question: Which project would you prefer for your municipality? III. Candidate selection conjoint. This survey experiment is designed to estimate what attributes of a potential candidate increase or decrease the probability that political candidates will prefer that candidate for their list. Each respondent will answer this question for three pairs of potential candidates.

Marijuana decriminalization framing. This survey experiment is designed to test whether support or opposition to marijuana decriminalization is affected by the issue framing. In this experiment, respondents are randomly placed into one of four experimental conditions: control, prison overcrowding, police targeting of youth, and availability of addiction and health treatment. The experimental conditions are as follows: 1. Control: [Experimental Framing left blank] 2. Prison Overcrowding: \u201cGiven recent efforts to decrease prison overcrowding\u2026\u201d 3. Police Targeting: \u201cGiven recent reports of police targeting of youth\u2026\u201d 4. Availability of addiction services: \u201cGiven recent efforts to increase the availability of addiction treatment\u2026\u201d The question is as follows: [Experimental Framing], which is closest to your opinion regarding Law 52 and the efforts to decriminalize marijuana in Tunisia? A. People arrested for possession of marijuana should always serve mandatory prison sentences. B. Judges should determine prison sentences on a case-by-case basis. C. People arrested for possession of marijuana should not serve mandatory prison sentences for at least the first two offenses. D. Possession of marijuana should not be a crime Given roughly 1900 respondents, each experimental condition will have between 450-500 respondents.", "q18": "Tunisia", "q19": "1900", "q20": "Yes", "q21":

Yet, the mechanisms under which some women politicians garner political support, while others do not, remains opaque. This study examines the relationship between the implementation of gender quotas and attitudes regarding women politicians in Tunisia.

In order to shed some insight on these questions we employ a multi-method study.

Second, we conduct two different survey experiments that allow us to gain greater empirical leverage on the questions outlined above.

Further, we expect to see heterogenous effects across respondents who live in locations where women are represented in politics as opposed to respondents who live in locations where women are not represented in politics. Lastly, we expect to see heterogenous treatment effects across partisan and ideological viewpoints. For example, we measure pre-treatment attitudes regarding gender equality (taken in part from the Arabarometer and Afrobarometer surveys). We expect that respondents who express a stronger belief in gender equality will be more likely to support women candidates. Likewise, we measure three pre-treatment attitudes regarding religion in politics, and we expect that respondents who are open to the influence of religion in politics will be more amenable to the female candidate who appeals to traditionalism than others.

Aleksandra \u015awiderska"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Freeganism is a relatively little explored social phenomenon. To date, studies on freeganism and freegans have been concentrated on describing their subculture, worldview and motivations. However, there is little research concerning the emotion that seems crucial in freeganism - disgust. The goal of the current study is to better understand psychophysiological correlates of a freegan lifestyle. We investigate the possible differences between freegans and non-freegans in propensity to feeling and expressing disgust. It is of particular interest whether these differences stem from previous predispositions, enabling freegans to practise dumpster diving, or rather from the dumpster diving practice itself.\n\nDisgust Sensitivity\n\nDisgust is considered a basic emotion, which has probably evolved to protect animals from contact with potentially pathogenic objects (Chapman &amp; Anderson, 2012; Curtis, Aunger, &amp; Rabie, 2004; Ekman, 1999; Jones, 2000). Feelings and behavioural and physiological responses to disgust seem to be universal for all humans (Ekman, 1999), involving avoidance, specific facial expression, increased saliva production, throat constriction or nauseas (Jones, 2000). However, people vary both in propensity to disgust and in the objects eliciting it in them (Curtis et al., 2004; Jones, 2000). Some of the latter are culturally specific (Cornelissen, 2016; Jones, 2000), which implies that disgust, though biologically based and physically experienced, is also socially shaped. Customs, concerns, education or religion influence the perception of certain stimuli as disgusting or not. As an example of education or belief, an object that touched a contaminated surface, but has no visible trace of it, needs the perceiver\u2019s representation of contamination as detrimental particles to elicit disgust (Jones, 2000). Moreover, disgust is associated with moral judgments (Inbar, Pizarro, Iyer, &amp; Haidt, 2012) - it tends to be felt toward objects or behaviours considered non-normative or impure in a given social environment. Reactions to disgust elicitors from both physical and social domains are shaped by individual proneness to experience this emotion, denoted disgust sensitivity (Haidt, McCauley, &amp; Rozin, 1994). \nDisgust sensitivity can be defined as an individual difference in tendency to react with disgust to certain stimuli (Olatunji, Sawchuk, de Jong, &amp; Lohr, 2006). Disgust sensitivity is higher in adults than children, women than men, individuals with higher than lower neuroticism and with than without obsessive-compulsive disorders (Tybur, \u00c7\u0131nar, Karinen, &amp; Perone, 2018). It also varies between mothers and childless women with lower disgust sensitivity of mothers (Prokop &amp; Fan\u010dovi\u010dov\u00e1, 2016), as well as between individuals with different political orientations with liberals being less sensitive (Inbar et al., 2012). Relationships with vulnerability to disease and pathogenic habitat are not straightforward. On the one hand, higher disgust sensitivity in a pathogen-rich environment might reduce the risk of infection. On the other hand, probability of contact with pathogens is nevertheless so high that developing tolerance or resistance may result more adaptive than mechanism leading to their avoidance (Tybur et al., 2018). It may also be the case that the differences between groups more and less vulnerable to pathogens only concern some domains of disgust sensitivity and not others (Fessler, Eng, &amp; Navarrete, 2005; Tybur &amp; Lieberman, 2016). \nAlthough the construct of disgust sensitivity can be divided into disgust in many domains, the number and characteristics of these domains vary across research (cf. Fergus &amp; Valentiner, 2009; Haidt et al., 1994; Olatunji et al., 2006; Olatunji et al., 2007; Petrowski et al., 2011; Tybur, Lieberman, &amp; Griskevicius, 2009). Olatunji and colleagues (2006) in their Disgust Emotion Scale distinguished five disgust domains: Animals, Injections and Blood Draws, Mutilation and Death, Smells, Rotting Foods. Their scale has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and convergent validity shown by positive correlations with respective subscales of Haidt et al.\u2019s (1994) Disgust Scale.\n\nPsychophysiology of Disgust\n\nApart from declarative measures, behavioural and psychophysiological ones are also utilised in research on disgust and disgust sensitivity. Among the behavioural methods, participant-determined time of exposure to a given object may be used as an index of disgust (Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, &amp; Ashmore, 1999). The psychophysiological methods include heart rate and skin conductance response measures, as well as electromyography (Stark, Walter, Schienle, &amp; Vaitl, 2005; Vrana, 1993). Stark et al. (2005) observed heart rate deceleration and increased skin conductance following exposure to disgusting stimuli,, compared to neutral conditions. Specific facial muscles are also involved in this psychophysiological response (Vrana, 1993). Electromyography (EMG) allows to measure their activity, thus providing a reliable index of experienced emotion (Fridlund &amp; Cacioppo, 1986).\nThe muscles engaged in the facial expression of disgust are Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii (Vrana, 1993). Corrugator supercilii participates in the expression of general emotional negativity, causing brow knitting, characteristic also to anger (Vrana, 1993). Levator labii, however, seems specific to disgust, being responsible for raising the upper lip and wrinkling the nasal region (Stark et al., 2005; Vrana, 1993).\n\nFreeganism\n\nThe name freeganism is a combination of words free and veganism and means an eating habit and a worldview based on valuing food and disapproving of its wastefulness and of consumerism (Black, 2012; Lindeman, 2012). Also called dumpster diving, scavenging or skipping, freeganism consists in finding, eating and sharing food disposed of by others (Gleizes, 2014; Sapa\u0142a, 2019). It is considered an environmental movement which opposes to \u2018food-for-profit\u2019 system resulting in food excess and waste (Barnard, 2016; Carolsfeld, Erikson, 2013; Cornelissen, 2016). Besides, it may be viewed as a commonsensical way to obtain food, saving money (Cornelissen, 2016; Sapa\u0142a, 2019).\nMost often freegans seek edible food in grocery markets\u2019 and supermarkets\u2019 waste bins (Barnard, 2016; Cornelissen, 2016; Sapa\u0142a, 2019). Physical contact with mixed dregs, rot and mould may evoke disgust. For freegans, however, \u2018ugly isn\u2019t a problem\u2019 (Carolsfeld &amp; Erikson, 2013, p. 256) - they seem not to perceive dirty, bruised or otherwise non market-standard food as disgusting (Carolsfeld &amp; Erikson, 2013). This is in line with the finding that food disgust may be a good predictor of eating behaviour: positive correlation was found between food disgust and food wasting (Ammann, Hartmann, &amp; Siegrist, 2018; Egolf, Siegrist, &amp; Hartmann, 2018).\nNot only leftovers themselves, but also the cultural taboo over waste  may elicit disgust toward freeganism (Cornelissen, 2016; Gleizes, 2014; Nguyen, Chen, &amp; Mukherjee, 2014). According to Nguyen et al. (2014), freegans are often stigmatized as contaminated and dirty. In their qualitative study the authors showed that freegans who identify themselves with the values and ideals their group follows (e.g., anti-consumerism or environmental protection) can establish a reverse stigma, attributing moral inferiority to the majority of a consumerist society. Thus, they do not perceive dumpster diving disgusting as it fulfils the ethical values their group believes in (Gleizes, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2014).\n\nPreselection or Experience?\n\nOn the one hand, Cornelissen (2016) argues that dumpster diving is (sub)culturally learned and that by ideational and linguistic means such as redefinition freegans seem to be able to \u2018turn distaste into taste\u2019 (Cornelissen, 2016, p. 501) and to minimize their disgust for dumpster diving. On the other hand, according to Rozin, Haidt and McCauley (2008), food disgust sensitivity appears quite stable throughout adulthood, which suggests that people who become freegans may be predisposed to it by a previously lower level of disgust sensitivity.\nEvidence from studies on disgust in medical students does not bring unequivocal conclusions, either. Rozin (2008) observed that first year students\u2019 specific disgust sensitivity to death and body envelope violation diminished after experiencing cadaver dissections, while other domains of disgust sensitivity remained unchanged. People deciding to study medicine may, however, be already less propense to disgust than others, as Consendine, Yu and Windsor\u2019s (2013) study indicates. The authors revealed that disgust sensitivity measured during an introductory university course in human behaviour predicted the students\u2019 intentions to choose medicine, nursing or pharmacy for their major: more disgust sensitive individuals were more likely to choose pharmacy over medicine or nursing. Possibly both processes form part of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and studying medicine. Individuals with lower disgust sensitivity may choose career that exposes them to more disgust elicitors, which, in turn, further diminish their sensitivity to disgust (Consendine et al., 2013). In the current study we would like to address this question in freegans\u2019 case.\n\nCurrent Research\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no published psychological or psychophysiological research on freegans\u2019 disgust. The first objective of this study is to examine the relationship between disgust sensitivity and freeganism. The second objective is to explore possible mechanisms of the potential lower disgust sensitivity in freegans, especially the interplay between preselection and experience in freegan activity. Furthermore, we also plan to explore the role of freegan in-group identification. Both declarative and psychophysiological methods (EMG) will be used in the measurement of disgust.\nWe are planning to investigate the following research questions:\n1) Are freegans less disgust sensitive than their non-freegan peers? And if so, are freegans less disgust sensitive than their non-freegan peers in general or only when it comes to food and smell disgust?\n2) Does lower disgust sensitivity seem to be more a cause or an effect of becoming a freegan?\na) Are experienced freegans less disgust sensitive than beginners?\nb) Is the relationship between food and smell disgust sensitivity and other types of disgust sensitivity weaker in experienced freegans than in beginners and non-freegans?\n3) Is there a relationship between freegans\u2019 in-group identification and disgust sensitivity?\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Main hypotheses\n\n1) Freegans will show lower disgust sensitivity than their non-freegan peers.\nAlternative 1a) Lower general sensitivity (three DES subscales, general disgust pictures ratings and EMG reactions) \u2013 suggests self-selection.\nAlternative 1b) Lower only food and smell sensitivity (two subscales from DES, food pictures) but not others (not three subscales or general disgust pictures) \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n2) More experienced freegans will have lower food and smell disgust sensitivity than less experienced freegans \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n3) Stronger identified freegans will have lower disgust sensitivity.\n\nOther tentative hypotheses\n\n4) Correlation for food and smell DES with pictures ratings and EMG reactions will be stronger than correlation for other DES subscales with EMG.\n5) Correlations between food and smell disgust sensitivity (averaged two DES subscales) and other types of disgust sensitivity (averaged remaining three DES subscales) will be weaker in freegans than non-freegans (4a) and in experienced freegans than in beginners (4b) \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

Participants were recruited via social media and were aimed to have similar demographic characteristics to the planned main sample. We acquired data from 49 participants (41 women, Mage = 22.49, SD = 3.45).\n The pre-test Internet survey contained our translation of DES and 23 images depicting unpleasant food, which were rated by participants for disgust (and exploratorily for edibility) on 5-point Likert-type scales from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust (and from 1 - completely inedible to 5 - completely edible). The pictures were also rated for valence and arousal on 9-point Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales, in which the numbers corresponded to pictures showing manikins in emotional states of different intensity from 1 of low intensity to 9 of high intensity. SAM scales were included because they are typically used in IAPS pictures assessment (Bradley &amp; Lang, 2007; Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 2008). Other pictures that we are planning to use are from the IAPS database (1111, 1274, 3019, 9008 9031, 9043, 9290, 9300, 9302, 9322, 9340, 9373) and were examined for their disgust-inducing properties in other studies (Borg, Jong, &amp; Schultz, 2010; Van Hooff, Devue, Vieweg, &amp; Theeuwes, 2013). Finally, participants were asked for demographic information.\nFrom the 23 food pictures, 12 pictures with highest mean disgust ratings were selected for the main study. Our food stimuli mean disgust rating was M = 2.34 on the 5-point scale and the ratings ranged from M = 2.29 to M = 3.88 meaning that they were slightly to moderately disgusting. They were descriptively less disgusting than the pictures from IAPS that we are planning to use as general disgust stimuli. In Van Hooff et al.\u2019s (2013) study the latter were rated on average as very disgusting: M = 4.03 on a similar 5-point scale. This is understandable as our pictures were showing \u201conly\u201d partly rotten food or food with insects on it and the pictures in Van Hooff were showing, for example, bloody organs or dirty toilets.\nOur food pictures\u2019 mean valence ranged from M = 1.92 to M = 3.12 on the 9-point SAM scale meaning that they were perceived as unpleasant. The selected disgusting food stimuli\u2019s valence seems comparable to the general disgust stimuli selected from the IAPS, mean valence of which ranged from M = 2.24 to M = 3.38 on a similar scale in previous studies (Lang et al., 2008). Mean arousal of our food stimuli ranged from M = 2.98 to M = 5.20 on the 9-point scale, which means the pictures evoked low to medium arousal and were descriptively less arousing than the selected pictures from the IAPS used in previous disgust studies where mean arousal ranged from M = 4.40 to M = 6.30 (Lang et al., 2008).\nThe food pictures were also exploratorily examined on perceived edibility. The 12 pictures selected on the basis of disgust ratings were rated as, on average, inedible, M = 1.70 on a 5-point scale, ratings ranging from M = 1.14 to M = 2.36.\n\tThe translated DES\u2019s reliability was satisfactory with a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.76 for the whole scale. The subscales\u2019 reliability ranged from \u03b1 = 0.67 (Animals) to \u03b1 = 0.91 (Rotting Food). \nParticipants\u2019 disgust sensitivity measured by DES was moderately positively correlated with reported disgust elicited by the pictures, r = 0.62. Rotting Food and Smell subscales\u2019 relation to disgust evoked by the pictures was, r = 0.71 and r = 0.56, respectively. \n\tIn conclusion, the pre-test allowed to select stimuli for the main study, to acknowledge the translated Disgust Emotion Scale as satisfactorily reliable and to observe an expected correlation of DES and pictures evaluation.\n"}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "We plan to acquire data from 60 participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision: 30 freegans and 30 non-freegans with similar demographic characteristics.

The study will take place in the laboratory of psychophysiology at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw and is planned to last about 30 minutes. On entering the lab participants will sign an informed consent. Then they will have their skin prepared and electrodes placed. They will be seated in front of a computer screen. The programmed procedure will start after the experimenter leaves the room.\nParticipants will have activity of Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii measured with EMG, while watching on a computer screen 12 disgust-inducing pictures from IAPS (International Affective Picture System; Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 2008) and 12 pictures showing unattractive food. The latter were pre-tested for their disgust-inducing properties (see the Pre-test and selection of stimuli section above). The pictures will be presented in random order, using MediaLab software. Each of the pictures will be preceded by a three- or six-second fixation mark and displayed for 6 seconds. Silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) surface electrodes will be used, with 0.25 cm diameter detection surfaces and 1 cm diameter housings. As Fridlund and Cacioppo (1986) recommend, the space between two electrodes in a pair will be about 1 cm. The electrodes measuring Corrugator supercilii activity will be placed above the brow: one on an imaginary vertical line above the inner corner of the eye and the other lateral and slightly superior to the first. The electrodes measuring Levator labii activity will be situated 1 cm lateral to the nostril baseline: one 0.5 cm below the nostril and the other superior and slightly lateral to the first. Ground electrode, with 0.5 cm diameter detection surface and 1.5 cm diameter housing, will be located in the middle of the forehead (Fridlund, Cacioppo, 1986). Electrodes, glaired with EEG gel, will be placed on cleaned skin. Impedances, examined using portable impedance checker, should not be higher than 10 k\u03a9.\n\tBesides of the EMG measurement, participants will rate how much disgusted they feel about each of the pictures from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust.\n\tSecond task will be to complete Disgust Emotion Scale (DES; Olatunji et al., 2006) in Polish translation, which has been examined in a pilot study and (for freegan participants) a Polish adaptation of Identification Scale adjusted to freegans (Cameron, 2004; general Polish adaptation by Bilewicz &amp; W\u00f3jcik, 2010). Freegan participants will also be asked how long they have been freegans, how often they go dumpster diving and how many times approximately they went dumpster diving. Furthermore, they will be asked questions concerning quality and intensity of freegan experience and motivations for dumpster diving. In the non-freegans\u2019 case, the open-ended question will concern their knowledge and interest in freeganism.\nThen they will be presented 7 pictures from IAPS showing young animals, aiming to abreact the exposure to previous unpleasant stimuli.

DES consists of 30 items pertaining to five subscales. The instruction is to rate how much disgust one would feel if exposed to a given item, e.g. \u2018Photos of wounded soldiers\u2019, \u2018A pile of rotting lettuce\u2019.

To date, studies on freeganism and freegans have been concentrated on describing their subculture, worldview and motivations. However, there is little research concerning the emotion that seems crucial in freeganism - disgust. The goal of the current study is to better understand psychophysiological correlates of a freegan lifestyle. We investigate the possible differences between freegans and non-freegans in propensity to feeling and expressing disgust. It is of particular interest whether these differences stem from previous predispositions, enabling freegans to practise dumpster diving, or rather from the dumpster diving practice itself.\n\nDisgust Sensitivity\n\nDisgust is considered a basic emotion, which has probably evolved to protect animals from contact with potentially pathogenic objects (Chapman &amp; Anderson, 2012; Curtis, Aunger, &amp; Rabie, 2004; Ekman, 1999; Jones, 2000). Feelings and behavioural and physiological responses to disgust seem to be universal for all humans (Ekman, 1999), involving avoidance, specific facial expression, increased saliva production, throat constriction or nauseas (Jones, 2000). However, people vary both in propensity to disgust and in the objects eliciting it in them (Curtis et al., 2004; Jones, 2000). Some of the latter are culturally specific (Cornelissen, 2016; Jones, 2000), which implies that disgust, though biologically based and physically experienced, is also socially shaped. Customs, concerns, education or religion influence the perception of certain stimuli as disgusting or not. As an example of education or belief, an object that touched a contaminated surface, but has no visible trace of it, needs the perceiver\u2019s representation of contamination as detrimental particles to elicit disgust (Jones, 2000). Moreover, disgust is associated with moral judgments (Inbar, Pizarro, Iyer, &amp; Haidt, 2012) - it tends to be felt toward objects or behaviours considered non-normative or impure in a given social environment. Reactions to disgust elicitors from both physical and social domains are shaped by individual proneness to experience this emotion, denoted disgust sensitivity (Haidt, McCauley, &amp; Rozin, 1994). \nDisgust sensitivity can be defined as an individual difference in tendency to react with disgust to certain stimuli (Olatunji, Sawchuk, de Jong, &amp; Lohr, 2006). Disgust sensitivity is higher in adults than children, women than men, individuals with higher than lower neuroticism and with than without obsessive-compulsive disorders (Tybur, \u00c7\u0131nar, Karinen, &amp; Perone, 2018). It also varies between mothers and childless women with lower disgust sensitivity of mothers (Prokop &amp; Fan\u010dovi\u010dov\u00e1, 2016), as well as between individuals with different political orientations with liberals being less sensitive (Inbar et al., 2012). Relationships with vulnerability to disease and pathogenic habitat are not straightforward. On the one hand, higher disgust sensitivity in a pathogen-rich environment might reduce the risk of infection. On the other hand, probability of contact with pathogens is nevertheless so high that developing tolerance or resistance may result more adaptive than mechanism leading to their avoidance (Tybur et al., 2018). It may also be the case that the differences between groups more and less vulnerable to pathogens only concern some domains of disgust sensitivity and not others (Fessler, Eng, &amp; Navarrete, 2005; Tybur &amp; Lieberman, 2016). \nAlthough the construct of disgust sensitivity can be divided into disgust in many domains, the number and characteristics of these domains vary across research (cf. Fergus &amp; Valentiner, 2009; Haidt et al., 1994; Olatunji et al., 2006; Olatunji et al., 2007; Petrowski et al., 2011; Tybur, Lieberman, &amp; Griskevicius, 2009). Olatunji and colleagues (2006) in their Disgust Emotion Scale distinguished five disgust domains: Animals, Injections and Blood Draws, Mutilation and Death, Smells, Rotting Foods. Their scale has demonstrated satisfactory reliability and convergent validity shown by positive correlations with respective subscales of Haidt et al.\u2019s (1994) Disgust Scale.\n\nPsychophysiology of Disgust\n\nApart from declarative measures, behavioural and psychophysiological ones are also utilised in research on disgust and disgust sensitivity. Among the behavioural methods, participant-determined time of exposure to a given object may be used as an index of disgust (Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, &amp; Ashmore, 1999). The psychophysiological methods include heart rate and skin conductance response measures, as well as electromyography (Stark, Walter, Schienle, &amp; Vaitl, 2005; Vrana, 1993). Stark et al. (2005) observed heart rate deceleration and increased skin conductance following exposure to disgusting stimuli,, compared to neutral conditions. Specific facial muscles are also involved in this psychophysiological response (Vrana, 1993). Electromyography (EMG) allows to measure their activity, thus providing a reliable index of experienced emotion (Fridlund &amp; Cacioppo, 1986).\nThe muscles engaged in the facial expression of disgust are Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii (Vrana, 1993). Corrugator supercilii participates in the expression of general emotional negativity, causing brow knitting, characteristic also to anger (Vrana, 1993). Levator labii, however, seems specific to disgust, being responsible for raising the upper lip and wrinkling the nasal region (Stark et al., 2005; Vrana, 1993).\n\nFreeganism\n\nThe name freeganism is a combination of words free and veganism and means an eating habit and a worldview based on valuing food and disapproving of its wastefulness and of consumerism (Black, 2012; Lindeman, 2012). Also called dumpster diving, scavenging or skipping, freeganism consists in finding, eating and sharing food disposed of by others (Gleizes, 2014; Sapa\u0142a, 2019). It is considered an environmental movement which opposes to \u2018food-for-profit\u2019 system resulting in food excess and waste (Barnard, 2016; Carolsfeld, Erikson, 2013; Cornelissen, 2016). Besides, it may be viewed as a commonsensical way to obtain food, saving money (Cornelissen, 2016; Sapa\u0142a, 2019).\nMost often freegans seek edible food in grocery markets\u2019 and supermarkets\u2019 waste bins (Barnard, 2016; Cornelissen, 2016; Sapa\u0142a, 2019). Physical contact with mixed dregs, rot and mould may evoke disgust. For freegans, however, \u2018ugly isn\u2019t a problem\u2019 (Carolsfeld &amp; Erikson, 2013, p. 256) - they seem not to perceive dirty, bruised or otherwise non market-standard food as disgusting (Carolsfeld &amp; Erikson, 2013). This is in line with the finding that food disgust may be a good predictor of eating behaviour: positive correlation was found between food disgust and food wasting (Ammann, Hartmann, &amp; Siegrist, 2018; Egolf, Siegrist, &amp; Hartmann, 2018).\nNot only leftovers themselves, but also the cultural taboo over waste  may elicit disgust toward freeganism (Cornelissen, 2016; Gleizes, 2014; Nguyen, Chen, &amp; Mukherjee, 2014). According to Nguyen et al. (2014), freegans are often stigmatized as contaminated and dirty. In their qualitative study the authors showed that freegans who identify themselves with the values and ideals their group follows (e.g., anti-consumerism or environmental protection) can establish a reverse stigma, attributing moral inferiority to the majority of a consumerist society. Thus, they do not perceive dumpster diving disgusting as it fulfils the ethical values their group believes in (Gleizes, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2014).\n\nPreselection or Experience?\n\nOn the one hand, Cornelissen (2016) argues that dumpster diving is (sub)culturally learned and that by ideational and linguistic means such as redefinition freegans seem to be able to \u2018turn distaste into taste\u2019 (Cornelissen, 2016, p. 501) and to minimize their disgust for dumpster diving. On the other hand, according to Rozin, Haidt and McCauley (2008), food disgust sensitivity appears quite stable throughout adulthood, which suggests that people who become freegans may be predisposed to it by a previously lower level of disgust sensitivity.\nEvidence from studies on disgust in medical students does not bring unequivocal conclusions, either. Rozin (2008) observed that first year students\u2019 specific disgust sensitivity to death and body envelope violation diminished after experiencing cadaver dissections, while other domains of disgust sensitivity remained unchanged. People deciding to study medicine may, however, be already less propense to disgust than others, as Consendine, Yu and Windsor\u2019s (2013) study indicates. The authors revealed that disgust sensitivity measured during an introductory university course in human behaviour predicted the students\u2019 intentions to choose medicine, nursing or pharmacy for their major: more disgust sensitive individuals were more likely to choose pharmacy over medicine or nursing. Possibly both processes form part of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and studying medicine. Individuals with lower disgust sensitivity may choose career that exposes them to more disgust elicitors, which, in turn, further diminish their sensitivity to disgust (Consendine et al., 2013). In the current study we would like to address this question in freegans\u2019 case.\n\nCurrent Research\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no published psychological or psychophysiological research on freegans\u2019 disgust. The first objective of this study is to examine the relationship between disgust sensitivity and freeganism. The second objective is to explore possible mechanisms of the potential lower disgust sensitivity in freegans, especially the interplay between preselection and experience in freegan activity. Furthermore, we also plan to explore the role of freegan in-group identification. Both declarative and psychophysiological methods (EMG) will be used in the measurement of disgust.\nWe are planning to investigate the following research questions:\n1) Are freegans less disgust sensitive than their non-freegan peers? And if so, are freegans less disgust sensitive than their non-freegan peers in general or only when it comes to food and smell disgust?\n2) Does lower disgust sensitivity seem to be more a cause or an effect of becoming a freegan?\na) Are experienced freegans less disgust sensitive than beginners?\nb) Is the relationship between food and smell disgust sensitivity and other types of disgust sensitivity weaker in experienced freegans than in beginners and non-freegans?\n3) Is there a relationship between freegans\u2019 in-group identification and disgust sensitivity?\n", "q4": "Main hypotheses\n\n1) Freegans will show lower disgust sensitivity than their non-freegan peers.\nAlternative 1a) Lower general sensitivity (three DES subscales, general disgust pictures ratings and EMG reactions) \u2013 suggests self-selection.\nAlternative 1b) Lower only food and smell sensitivity (two subscales from DES, food pictures) but not others (not three subscales or general disgust pictures) \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n2) More experienced freegans will have lower food and smell disgust sensitivity than less experienced freegans \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n3) Stronger identified freegans will have lower disgust sensitivity.\n\nOther tentative hypotheses\n\n4) Correlation for food and smell DES with pictures ratings and EMG reactions will be stronger than correlation for other DES subscales with EMG.\n5) Correlations between food and smell disgust sensitivity (averaged two DES subscales) and other types of disgust sensitivity (averaged remaining three DES subscales) will be weaker in freegans than non-freegans (4a) and in experienced freegans than in beginners (4b) \u2013 suggests influence of experience.\n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, \u201cnatural experiments,\u201d and regression discontinuity designs.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "The stimuli will be shown to the participants in a randomized order.", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "In order to select appropriate stimuli and examine properties of our translation of DES, we conducted a pre-test. Participants were recruited via social media and were aimed to have similar demographic characteristics to the planned main sample. We acquired data from 49 participants (41 women, Mage = 22.49, SD = 3.45).\n The pre-test Internet survey contained our translation of DES and 23 images depicting unpleasant food, which were rated by participants for disgust (and exploratorily for edibility) on 5-point Likert-type scales from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust (and from 1 - completely inedible to 5 - completely edible). The pictures were also rated for valence and arousal on 9-point Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales, in which the numbers corresponded to pictures showing manikins in emotional states of different intensity from 1 of low intensity to 9 of high intensity. SAM scales were included because they are typically used in IAPS pictures assessment (Bradley &amp; Lang, 2007; Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 2008). Other pictures that we are planning to use are from the IAPS database (1111, 1274, 3019, 9008 9031, 9043, 9290, 9300, 9302, 9322, 9340, 9373) and were examined for their disgust-inducing properties in other studies (Borg, Jong, &amp; Schultz, 2010; Van Hooff, Devue, Vieweg, &amp; Theeuwes, 2013). Finally, participants were asked for demographic information.\nFrom the 23 food pictures, 12 pictures with highest mean disgust ratings were selected for the main study. Our food stimuli mean disgust rating was M = 2.34 on the 5-point scale and the ratings ranged from M = 2.29 to M = 3.88 meaning that they were slightly to moderately disgusting. They were descriptively less disgusting than the pictures from IAPS that we are planning to use as general disgust stimuli. In Van Hooff et al.\u2019s (2013) study the latter were rated on average as very disgusting: M = 4.03 on a similar 5-point scale. This is understandable as our pictures were showing \u201conly\u201d partly rotten food or food with insects on it and the pictures in Van Hooff were showing, for example, bloody organs or dirty toilets.\nOur food pictures\u2019 mean valence ranged from M = 1.92 to M = 3.12 on the 9-point SAM scale meaning that they were perceived as unpleasant. The selected disgusting food stimuli\u2019s valence seems comparable to the general disgust stimuli selected from the IAPS, mean valence of which ranged from M = 2.24 to M = 3.38 on a similar scale in previous studies (Lang et al., 2008). Mean arousal of our food stimuli ranged from M = 2.98 to M = 5.20 on the 9-point scale, which means the pictures evoked low to medium arousal and were descriptively less arousing than the selected pictures from the IAPS used in previous disgust studies where mean arousal ranged from M = 4.40 to M = 6.30 (Lang et al., 2008).\nThe food pictures were also exploratorily examined on perceived edibility. The 12 pictures selected on the basis of disgust ratings were rated as, on average, inedible, M = 1.70 on a 5-point scale, ratings ranging from M = 1.14 to M = 2.36.\n\tThe translated DES\u2019s reliability was satisfactory with a Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.76 for the whole scale. The subscales\u2019 reliability ranged from \u03b1 = 0.67 (Animals) to \u03b1 = 0.91 (Rotting Food). \nParticipants\u2019 disgust sensitivity measured by DES was moderately positively correlated with reported disgust elicited by the pictures, r = 0.62. Rotting Food and Smell subscales\u2019 relation to disgust evoked by the pictures was, r = 0.71 and r = 0.56, respectively. \n\tIn conclusion, the pre-test allowed to select stimuli for the main study, to acknowledge the translated Disgust Emotion Scale as satisfactorily reliable and to observe an expected correlation of DES and pictures evaluation.\n", "q13": "60 participants: 30 freegans + 30 non-freegans", "q14": "To achieve statistical power at the level of 0,8 with alpha error rate = 0,05, sample size of 63 participants was calculated using powerandsamplesize.com.

As the studied group is very specific and not publicly visible, participants will be recruited via social media groups, snowballing and personal contacts. The study will take place in the laboratory of psychophysiology at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw and is planned to last about 30 minutes. On entering the lab participants will sign an informed consent. Then they will have their skin prepared and electrodes placed. They will be seated in front of a computer screen. The programmed procedure will start after the experimenter leaves the room.\nParticipants will have activity of Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii measured with EMG, while watching on a computer screen 12 disgust-inducing pictures from IAPS (International Affective Picture System; Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 2008) and 12 pictures showing unattractive food. The latter were pre-tested for their disgust-inducing properties (see the Pre-test and selection of stimuli section above). The pictures will be presented in random order, using MediaLab software. Each of the pictures will be preceded by a three- or six-second fixation mark and displayed for 6 seconds. Silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) surface electrodes will be used, with 0.25 cm diameter detection surfaces and 1 cm diameter housings. As Fridlund and Cacioppo (1986) recommend, the space between two electrodes in a pair will be about 1 cm. The electrodes measuring Corrugator supercilii activity will be placed above the brow: one on an imaginary vertical line above the inner corner of the eye and the other lateral and slightly superior to the first. The electrodes measuring Levator labii activity will be situated 1 cm lateral to the nostril baseline: one 0.5 cm below the nostril and the other superior and slightly lateral to the first. Ground electrode, with 0.5 cm diameter detection surface and 1.5 cm diameter housing, will be located in the middle of the forehead (Fridlund, Cacioppo, 1986). Electrodes, glaired with EEG gel, will be placed on cleaned skin. Impedances, examined using portable impedance checker, should not be higher than 10 k\u03a9.\n\tBesides of the EMG measurement, participants will rate how much disgusted they feel about each of the pictures from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust.\n\tSecond task will be to complete Disgust Emotion Scale (DES; Olatunji et al., 2006) in Polish translation, which has been examined in a pilot study and (for freegan participants) a Polish adaptation of Identification Scale adjusted to freegans (Cameron, 2004; general Polish adaptation by Bilewicz &amp; W\u00f3jcik, 2010). Freegan participants will also be asked how long they have been freegans, how often they go dumpster diving and how many times approximately they went dumpster diving. Furthermore, they will be asked questions concerning quality and intensity of freegan experience and motivations for dumpster diving. In the non-freegans\u2019 case, the open-ended question will concern their knowledge and interest in freeganism.\nThen they will be presented 7 pictures from IAPS showing young animals, aiming to abreact the exposure to previous unpleasant stimuli. After the programmed procedure will end, they will call the experimenter and have the electrodes removed. Finally, they will be debriefed about the aims of the study and thanked for participation.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Both general and food disgust sensitivity will be assessed with three measures: two declarative and one psychophysiological (EMG; described in the Data collection procedures section). The declarative measures will include pictures ratings from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust and results on Disgust Emotion Scale (DES; Olatunji et al., 2006 in our pretested translation). DES consists of 30 items pertaining to five subscales. The instruction is to rate how much disgust one would feel if exposed to a given item, e.g. \u2018Photos of wounded soldiers\u2019, \u2018A pile of rotting lettuce\u2019. The responses are given on 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 - no disgust at all to 5 - extreme disgust.\nGeneral disgust sensitivity will be indicated by the result on three non-food-related subscales of DES: Animals,  Injections and Blood Draws, Mutilation and Death; ratings of disgust-inducing pictures and Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii reactions to disgust-inducing pictures. Correspondingly, food disgust sensitivity will be indicated by the result in Rotting Food and Smell subscales of DES, ratings of pictures showing unattractive food and Corrugator supercilii and Levator labii reactions to pictures showing unattractive food.\n\tExperience with freeganism will be measured with a yes/no question, filtering the subsequent questions. Freegans\u2019 in-group identification will be measured with the Identification Scale adjusted to freegans (Cameron, 2004; general Polish adaptation by Bilewicz &amp; W\u00f3jcik, 2010). The scale comprises 6 items (sample item: \u2018I feel strong ties to other [ingroup members]\u2019). The responses are given on 5-point Likert-type scale from 1 - strongly disagree to 5 - strongly agree.\nFreegans\u2019 experience in dumpster diving will be investigated with questions about: declared time since starting (in months), frequency (how many times per month) and number of dumpster diving experiences, the type of containers frequented, kinds of food taken and usage of gloves. Their motivation for freeganism will be explored with an open-ended question about how and why they started dumpster diving. Non-freegans will be asked an open-ended question about their knowledge what freeganism is and whether they would be willing to try it, instead.\n\tWe will also control age, gender, education, place of residence (urban or rural) and political orientation (one-item seven-point scale from 1 - strongly left-wing to 7 - strongly right-wing).\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "In order to examine the H1, we will compare freegans\u2019 and non-freegans\u2019 results in DES and its subscales, their pictures ratings and their Corrugator and Levator activity. ANCOVA will be used for each measure, controlling for demographic variables.\n\tTo examine whether food disgust decreases with gaining freegan experience (H2) we will investigate correlations between measures of experience and DES Rotting Food and Smell subscales, pictures ratings and Corrugator and Levator activity.\n\tTo test the H3, Pearson correlations will be calculated to examine the relations between in-group identification and disgust sensitivity measured by DES, pictures ratings and EMG results.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=6fmbq", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/de-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "de-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6fmbq", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6fmbq", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/mhbct/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "mhbct", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qdkm3/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "qdkm3", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/6fmbq/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/6fmbq/"}}, {"id": "n52fj", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "PII &amp;

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine on UC, in order to provide an evidence support for clinical practice.", "q4": "If Chinese herbal medicine is effective for ulcerative colitis, the patients' condition will be relieved", "q5": "Other", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "Three English databases including PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library and three Chinese databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data knowledge service platform and VIP information resource integration service platform will be searched from its inception without language limitation.
