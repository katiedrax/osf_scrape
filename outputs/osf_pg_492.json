Because of this it is likely that the debate about Australia\u2019s organ donation system will re-ignite with questions raised as to whether Australia should follow the UK\u2019s lead (in the belief that this will lead to a greater number of organs donated upon death).  Although the move towards considering opt-out has occurred before in Australia,[1-2] there is limited recent evidence as to what people know and believe about the different systems of organ donation.  Further, as \u2018soft\u2019 opt-out systems where the explicit consent of the family for organ retrieval is still required are frequently misperceived as \u2018hard\u2019 opt-out systems (where explicit family consent is not required), any move to a \u2018soft\u2019 opt-out system may lead to fewer people registering their wishes with the Australian Organ Donor Register, having conversations with family members about their organ donation preference prior to death, and donating their organs while living.  \n\nIn 2015, Wales was the first country in the UK to move to a soft opt-out system with the target to increase the number of organ donors by 25%, a figure that is consistent with the 20% increase in donor rates reported in other countries with soft opt-out systems.[3] An observational study comparing the 3 years prior and 18 months after the legislation change showed that while consent rates increased to 61% overall (UK consent rates also increased to 63.1% in this period), the numbers of deceased donors did not increase.[4] Organ donation registration increased by 4% (from 34% to 38%), with 6% registering not to donate.[4] Approaches to family during this time period showed that they still sought to override their loved one\u2019s organ donation decision and found the concept of deemed consent to be complicated and difficult to understand.[5] The 2018 Annual Organ Donation report from the Welsh Government showed a fall in the number of living donors (-14%) and patients receiving transplants (-8%) after the legislation change.[6] Further, the 2019 Welsh public attitudes to organ donation survey reported that only 55% of people have had family discussions about organ donation, representing a 5% increase after legislation change.[7] Collectively, these figures suggest that any move to a soft opt-out system in Australia may have the same unintended consequences as observed in Wales.  Specifically, that organ donation rates may fall as families refuse to consent to organ retrieval because they are unsure of the potential donor\u2019s wishes, fewer people choosing to be living donors due to a misperception that the demand-supply gap for organs has been met, and little change in the numbers of potential donors registering their decision on the Australian Organ Donor Register or telling their family their organ donation preference.\n\nA second issue arising with a move to an opt-out system is with regard to the nature of the contribution that the donor is seen to make through donating.  Organ donation, rightly or wrongly, has often been characterised as a \u2018gift\u2019 that the donor (and their family) make to another person.[8] While this can lead to the expectation of gratitude from the recipient to the donor\u2019s family, a number of analyses suggest that organ donation in an opt-in system can have additional ongoing benefits for the donor\u2019s family and the legacy of the donor themselves.  That is, by \u2018gifting\u2019 an organ the grieving process can be eased as families take comfort in perceiving that some good has come out of their relative\u2019s death.  Further, donors\u2019 families come to regard their relative as (more) special and as someone to be proud of for their selfless act.  These perceived \u2018benefits\u2019 to donating may change if the system for donating changes from opt-in to opt-out (c.f. Noyes et al[4]).[9] Specifically, the assumed default that everyone will donate in an opt-out system means that those who donate will no longer be seen as special, while those who refuse to donate may be seen less positively. Such a change in perceptions about organ donation may have further flow-on effects in decreasing the number of people willing to donate and the number of families willing to consent to donation in an opt-out system.\n\nWe propose an in-depth exploration of current understanding of and attitudes towards organ donation systems amongst members of the general Australian community in order to provide key information for organ donation stakeholders, policy makers, and health professionals, in the event that changes in the organ donation system are considered or come into effect in the future.\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nCurrent Understanding\n1.\tHow do members of the general community believe that organ donation currently works in Australia\u2019s opt-in system?\na.\tWhat percentage of adults do members of the general community believe die in a way such that their organs can be donated?\nb.\tWhat percentage of adults who die in a way such that their organs can be donated do members of the general community believe would actually end up donating their organs?\nc.\tHow do adult members of the general community feel about those who donate their organs in the current system?\n\n2.\tIf Australia instead had a soft opt-out system (as England will in 2020), how do members of the general community believe that organ donation will work under such a system?\na.\tWhat percentage of adults do members of the general community believe will die in a way such that their organs can be donated?\nb.\tWhat percentage of those who die in a way such that their organs can be donated do members of the general community believe would actually end up donating their organs?\nc.\tHow do members of the general community feel about those who donate their organs in a soft opt-out system?\n\nComparison between alternative systems\n3.\tWhen accurate information is given about soft opt-out and opt-in systems, what percentage of adults (defined as those aged 18 or above) who die in a way that makes them eligible to become organ donors do members of the general community expect will become organ donors?\n4.\tWhen accurate information is given about soft opt-out and opt-in systems, what percentage of adults do members of the general community think will have registered their intention (to donate or not donate) with the Australian Organ Donor Register?\n5.\tWhen accurate information is given about soft opt-out and opt-in systems, what percentage of adults do members of the general community think will have discussed their intention (to donate or not to donate) with their family and/or close relatives?\n6.\tWhen accurate information is given about soft opt-out and opt-in systems, what percentage of adults do members of the general community think will be a living kidney donor (to a loved one or stranger)?\n\nPROJECT DESIGN\nThis study will explore current understanding of organ donation in Australia and explore perceptions and understanding of the existing opt-in donation system in Australia and of a soft opt-out system.  Following the provision of accurate information about opt-in and soft opt-out systems, participants perceptions of others\u2019 donation related behaviours will be explored. \n\nHypotheses \n1.\tThe estimates of those registering for the first time and discussing their decision to donate or not to donate will be higher under an opt-in system than under a soft opt-out system. \n2.\tThe estimates of the number of people whose organs are suitable for transplant who go on to donate will be higher under a soft opt-out system than under an opt-in system. \n3.\tThe estimates of those donating their kidney while living to a loved one or stranger will be higher under an opt-in system than under a soft opt-out system. \n\nSAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS, SIZE, AND DERIVATION\nAdults will be eligible to participate in the study if they are aged over 18 years and are Australian citizens. Eligible participants will be recruited to the study via the Prolific Academic online panel (limited to the Australian cohort), UQ student and community networks (e.g., recruited through the School of Psychology Student Participation scheme), and/or Australian residents in the general community (e.g., snowball sampling).   We will aim for a sample of participants that is 50% male, 50% female in composition and that comprises participants of a range of ages. \n\nLin et al.[10] reports effect sizes ranging from small (e.g., d = 0.16) to moderate (e.g., eta-squared = 0.16).  Adopting Cohen\u2019s norms of small and medium effect sizes, we adopted a small to moderate f value of 0.18, to determine the required sample size for the study using G* power.[11] \nBased on an estimated effect size of f = 0.18 with a specified alpha level of .05, and a power level of .90, for a between-subjects ANOVA with three levels, the analysis indicated a total required sample size range of 396.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nMeasures\nPrior to consenting to participate in the study all participants will be provided a Participant Information Sheet which outlines the aims and requirements of the study. The study will include questions about participant age, gender, and registration status on the Australian Organ Donor Register, as well as personal experience with transplantation and donation. Participants will be asked to provide a unique identifier to ensure all participants can be appropriately compensated (e.g. course credit, monetary) in a way which maintains participant anonymity. Demographic questions are presented at the end of the survey. Where possible, established measures used in previous organ donation studies or questions based on prior research findings will be used for the remaining measures. \nThe study will assess participant knowledge of the current opt-in donation system in Australia. Those who correctly perceive the current system will be randomly assigned to answer questions on the following topics for either the current opt-in system or a soft opt-out system: \n\u2022\tthe number of people who die in a way that makes organ donation possible and actually become organ donors within this system; \n\u2022\tdemand for living donors and the number of people who donate while living (adapted from [6]); and\n\u2022\thow many people communicate their donation decision within this system (register, discuss)[6].   \nFurther all those who participate in this study will be asked their perceptions about and attitudes towards organ donors (adapted from [12-15]), myths about organ donation,[16-18] and perceived effectiveness of donation systems and why. \n\nANALYSIS PLAN\n\nDemographics\nDemographic characteristics of respondents will be analysed using appropriate statistics (e.g., counts, means, standard deviations etc) in order to describe the sample obtained.\n\nQ1-2 \nAppropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., percentages) and analyses (e.g., chi-square) will be generated to illustrate respondent\u2019s knowledge of the current opt-in system of organ donation and (for those allocated to this condition) their perception of how a soft opt-out system would operate.\n\nQ3-13 \nResponses to these questions will be analysed using an independent groups t-test comparing those in the opt-in vs those in the soft opt-out condition. \n\nExploratory factor analysis will be conducted on responses to Q11, Q12, and Q13.  If the results of this analysis indicate that appropriate composite scales can be created that are internally reliable (determined by Cronbach\u2019s alpha of &gt;.7) then composite scales representing responses to Q11, Q12 and Q13 will be generated.  Responses to these scales will be analysed using a one-way ANOVA comparing those in the randomised opt-in vs those in the soft opt-out condition along with those who incorrectly identified the current system of organ donation in operation in Australia.  If significant differences are observed then these will be followed up with the appropriate post hoc analysis (e.g. Tukey HSD test) with an adjustment for multiple comparisons made to the p value.\n\nQ14\nResponses to Q14 will be described (mean, standard deviation).\n\nQ15\nResponses to Q15 by group (opt-in, soft opt-out, misperception of current system in Australia) will be explored via chi-square.  Qualitative responses will be coded using thematic analysis by the investigators.\n\nExploratory analyses\nResponses to the key focal outcomes will be explored as a function of a range of demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, experience with organ transplant etc). This will be conducted in order to advance our understanding of demographic characteristics that may impact perceptions of organ donation under the different systems described. \n\nDATA COLLECTION\nData collection is nearing completion (expected completion Feb 2020).\n\nETHICS\nThis study was granted Human Research Ethics Approval from The University of Queensland on the 30th September 2019. Participation is entirely voluntary, and participants are free to withdraw at any time. A summary of the results of the study for Participants will be freely accessible on the Donor Research Network website after study completion.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\tDelriviere L, Boronovskis H.

If significant differences are observed then these will be followed up with the appropriate post hoc analysis (e.g. Tukey HSD test) with an adjustment for multiple comparisons made to the p value.\n\nQ14\nResponses to Q14 will be described (mean, standard deviation).\n\nQ15\nResponses to Q15 by group (opt-in, soft opt-out, misperception of current system in Australia) will be explored via chi-square.  Qualitative responses will be coded using thematic analysis by the investigators.\n\nExploratory analyses\nResponses to the key focal outcomes will be explored as a function of a range of demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, experience with organ transplant etc). This will be conducted in order to advance our understanding of demographic characteristics that may impact perceptions of organ donation under the different systems described. \n\nDATA COLLECTION\nData collection is nearing completion (expected completion Feb 2020).\n\nETHICS\nThis study was granted Human Research Ethics Approval from The University of Queensland on the 30th September 2019. Participation is entirely voluntary, and participants are free to withdraw at any time. A summary of the results of the study for Participants will be freely accessible on the Donor Research Network website after study completion.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\tDelriviere L, Boronovskis H.

The number of trials on psychotherapies for adult depression is very large and is quickly growing. Because of this large body of knowledge, it is important that the results of these studies are summarized and integrated in meta-analytic studies. More than a decade ago we developed a meta-analytic database of these trials, which was updated yearly through systematic literature searches. Recently, we developed a new version of this meta-analytic database, built on the systems and experience from our earlier database, but with completely new searches and improved methods. In this paper we will describe the methods and some first results of this database.\nDescription. We conducted systematic literature searches in bibliographical databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials to identify all trials on psychotherapy for adult depression (deadline January 1st, 2019). We excluded trials on maintenance and relapse prevention, dissertations, collaborative care, and studies not published in English, German, Spanish or Dutch. After reading 21,976 records (16,701 after exclusion of duplicates), we included 661 randomized trials. We distinguished the following categories of trials: Psychotherapy versus pharmacotherapy (65 studies), combined treatment versus pharmacotherapy alone (46), combined treatment versus psychotherapy alone (29), combined treatment versus psychotherapy plus placebo (18), psychotherapy versus control (335), psychotherapy versus another therapy (109), psychotherapy for inpatients (34), unguided self-help interventions (48), comparisons of different treatment formats (38), cognitive bias modification (14) and other comparisons (99). \nOver the years we have published several dozens of meta-analyses using this databases (including its previous versions).\nConclusion. Psychotherapy for depression is definitely the best studied type of psychotherapy for any mental health problem. We hope that our database can be used as a resource for researchers who want to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses of subgroups of these studies.\n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-01-26T19:25:18.194187", "date_modified": "2020-01-26T19:19:31.520880", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [""], "year": "2019"}, "analytics_key": "8b9a80c614ef371ec5406e1886c9e06db6cb45c0e8416ddc6eb3f99d843e553811c410081b748567b35488041391ce0772a6b49e2c268ccae3ca695825d74be44dc226deebd2980942e731080aa08b655fed04c17eaebda1835fc3aed7c58b799fe6907ac83adbfe88e42e0feee0097aa440988bf5996b36b85a088d083c678ab2c3cd041c8ec33d2be40ba2d4acb8b9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-01-26T19:25:18.168037", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Preventing the onset of depressive disorders: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Pim Cuijpers, Eirini Karyotaki, Soledad Quero, Blanca Pineda, Ricardo Munoz, Sascha Y Struijs, Jazmin Llamas, Caroline Figueroa"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with considerable loss of quality of life in patients and their relatives, enormous economic costs and excess mortality.

This will familiarize the directors and the teachers with the project and they will thus be able to answer parents\u2019 questions and respond to potential concerns. \nProcedure and material\nThe study will consist in a series of observations in French preschools. Preschool days are very structured: The children alternate between free play times, collective greeting times or circle times, and educational activities in small groups. Typically, after an initial free play time, the preschool day begins with a circle time that consists of all children sitting in a circle, and the teacher giving a semi-structured lesson. These circle times exist in all French preschools and take place 2-4 times a day. They vary in content and style, including discussing the weather, counting the number of boys and girls in the circle, reading a book, talking about personal experiences or singing a song. In order to make comparison between classrooms possible, we will limit the observations to these circle times.\nAll videos will be recorded and time coded with Noldus Media Recorder (version 2.5, 2013). 6 to 8 collective circle times will be recorded by classroom. For greeting times (i.e., collective circle time), 6 cameras linked to the recording device (Noldus Media Recorder) will be installed in the \u201ccircle area\u201d (i.e., the place in the classroom where circle times take place) before the children arrived in the classroom the morning. For each observation, a research assistant will start the recording device before leaving the classroom in order to avoid interference with the course of the session. After that, the observations will be coded and the data analyzed, a meeting with the teachers involved in the study will be organized in order to debrief them and to present them the main results. \nData Coding\nFollowing the observation sessions, the obtained video-footage will be uploaded onto multiple secure hard-drives. Next, the video-footage of the four cameras will be synchronized and paired together using Noldus Observer XT software (Version 14.2, 2018). \nCoding children and teacher\u2019s behaviors. A coding scheme have been established before data collection with The Noldus Observer XT software (Version 14.2, 2018). For each child, we will code the duration and number of occurrences of speaking as an indicator of oral participation. More specifically, the coding scheme includes the following behaviors: \u201cspeak\u201d and \u201cnon speak\u201d. The former includes four modifiers: (1) \u201cspeak after being questioned by the teacher\u201d; (2) \u201cspeak without being questioned by the teacher\u201d; (3) \u201cspeak by interrupting another child\u201d; (4) \u201cspeak by interrupting the teacher\u201d. These modifiers will be regrouped in two meta-categories for the analyses: \u201cspeak after being questioned\u201d (i.e., modifier 1) and \u201cspeak without being questioned\u201d, which regroups modifiers (2), (3) and (4). The behavior \u201cspeak\u201d will not be coded when more than 3 children are speaking at the same time. All observations will be double coded by two independent coders. Intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) will be used to analyze the inter-observer reliability. Based on Cicchetti\u2019s (1964) classification, an ICC greater or equal to .60 reflects a good reliability between the two coders. We thus aim to reach ICC of at least .60 for the double coded observations. To ensure the anonymity of the collected data (coded behaviors, sex, date of birth and occupation of parents), the teacher will attribute a random numeric code to each child. This code will be used to match children\u2019s behaviors and administrative records.\nCoding SES. In social sciences, and in psychology in particular, different indicators are used to measure SES. The three main indicators are income, level of education and type of occupation (Kraus &amp; Stephens, 2012; Oakes &amp; Rossi, 2003). In this study, SES will be assessed according to parental occupations (Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017) as it is the only indicator available from French school authorities. This variable has been shown to be a good proxy for overall SES (Oakes &amp; Rossi, 2003; Goudeau, Autin, &amp; Croizet, 2017). SES ranking will be determined by the highest level of occupation held by either parent. For example, if the mother is a physician and the father a manual worker, the student will be assigned to the high SES group. Low-SES group will include children of manual and administrative workers, other blue-collar workers (employees, artisans, farmers, etc.), and unemployed persons. Middle-SES group will include children whose parents have intermediate occupations as technicians, nurses, educators, intermediate civil servant or military personnel.

"}}}, "recommended-hypothesis": {"value": {"question4a": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "question5a": {"extra": [], "value": "In many countries, socioeconomic status (SES), which can be captured by education, income, and/or occupational status, has a significant influence on academic achievement: the lower a student\u2019s SES, the more likely they are to experience difficulties and to drop out of school before attending university (OCDE, 2016). This influence of SES is observed very early during development: Compared to low-SES children, middle- and high-SES children have higher verbal skills at the age of 2 (Grobon, Panico, &amp; Solaz, 2019), and they possess more knowledge of the sounds and names of letters, as well as a higher level of familiarity with books at the age of 4 (Bowey, 1995; Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker, 1998; Sublet &amp; Pr\u00eateur, 1988). In many countries, despite important differences in the availability of early childhood education systems, preschool is designed to reduce these initial inequalities by providing low-SES children with greater familiarity and readiness in speaking, pre-reading and counting. However, existing studies do not fully support that preschool is a great equalizer as initial disparities in education are still existent at the beginning of first grade (Colmant, Jeantheau, &amp; Murat, 2002; Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002; Maurin, 2007; Rocher, 2015). The first objective of this study is to examine why preschool settings fail to level initial academic disparities related to SES backgrounds. Our hypothesis is that preschool settings could unintentionally not allowing an equal oral participation of children from different SES backgrounds. Moreover, the fact that inequalities are still persistent in first grade do not inform us regarding their evolution during preschool: are they attenuated, do they remain constant, or are they amplified? As existing studies stay silent regarding this evolution during preschool, our second objective is to investigate how inequalities evolve from the beginning to the end of preschool. \nStudies conducted in France and in the United States reveal that early and regular attendance is beneficial for achievement \u2013especially for low-SES children\u2013 as it provides an advantage at school entry (e.g., alphabet recognition, counting, and prewriting and reading skills; Huang, 2017). However, these types of advantages are not systematic and mostly depend on the quality of the preschool programs (Lipsey, Farran, &amp; Durkin, 2018). Moreover, there is substantial evidence that despite these benefits, attending preschool does not level the playing field as low-SES children enter first grade still lagging behind middle- and high-SES children in terms of speaking, reading, writing as well as counting skills (Colmant, Jeantheau, &amp; Murat, 2002; Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002; Maurin, 2007; Rocher, 2015). Furthering our understanding of the construction of inequalities at the preschool level is a major issue, as these initial inequalities lay the groundwork for subsequent differences throughout students\u2019 progression in the educational system. \nThe persistent relationship between SES and academic achievement can be explained by structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood or home environment, which have a direct impact on academic skills (American Psychological Association. Task Force on Socioeconomic Status, 2007; Duncan &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 1997). However, a growing body of evidence has also highlighted the role played by classroom contexts in the achievement gap between middle- high-SES students and low-SES students (Croizet, Goudeau, Marot, &amp; Millet, 2017). Understanding how academic contexts can play a role in the achievement gap related to SES backgrounds requires considering that academic settings and practices are not neutral. Indeed, classrooms settings are inherently saturated with cultural norms (e.g., language use, school knowledge or ways of being) that are closer to the cultural dispositions shaped in middle- and high-SES families than those developed in low-SES families (Bernstein, 1975; Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990; Lareau, 2003; Stephens, Markus, &amp; Fryberg, 2012; Stephens, Markus, &amp; Phillips, 2014). Recent research has documented that the cultural mismatch between academic norms and cultural dispositions developed through family socialization undermines low-SES students\u2019 achievement (Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017; Stephens, Fryberg, Markus, Johnson, &amp; Covarrubias, 2012).\nThe cultural mismatch between the home and school resides in two core dimensions: First, academic settings tend to promote and reward independence as the cultural standard for how to be a good student (Stephens, Fryberg et al., 2012). For example, teachers expect students to develop and to use their voice to express their own opinions and interests, to share their personal experience and make their own choices. This independent way of being which orients students to their own thoughts, feelings and actions is closer to middle- and high-SES family\u2019s socialization practices that invite children to put forward their interests, preferences and opinions in various activities of everyday life than to low-SES family\u2019s socialization practices (Lareau, 2003; Kusserow, 2004; Miller &amp; Cho, 2018; Miller, Cho &amp; Bracey, 2005; Schieffelin &amp; Ochs, 1986). At the university level, research has documented that low-SES students\u2019 experience of cultural mismatch with independent norms can undermine academic performance (Stephens, Fryberg et al., 2012). \nSecond, academic contexts value some forms of academic knowledge and skills that are closer to the cultural dispositions shaped in middle- and high-SES contexts than those shaped in low-SES contexts (Lareau, 2003; Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017; Lahire, 2019). For instance, middle- and high-SES parents are more likely than low-SES parents to engage in cultural practices that develop academic readiness, such as playing educational games at home, reading stories to children or going to museums and libraries. Experiments with 5th and 6th graders have shown that having less familiarity with academic tasks led low-SES children to experience social comparisons that disrupt their achievement (Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017). While research has examined how the experience of cultural mismatch can be detrimental for achievement \u2013 from primary school to university\u2013 it has yet to focus on the mechanisms through which preschools may unintentionally amplify \u2014instead of reduce\u2014 academic disparities related to SES and thus undermine the future achievement of low-SES students.\nSome qualitative observations offer initial insight into how preschool may unintentionally amplify academic disparities. In preschool, classroom settings accord an important role to children\u2019s participation and a great deal of attention is paid to their verbalization (Millet &amp; Croizet, 2016; Streib, 2011). During circle time or classroom meetings, teachers expect children to share their personal experiences (e.g., \u201cwhat did you do this weekend?\u201d) and to express their opinion and interests. Nevertheless, qualitative observations in particular preschools suggest that low-SES children are less likely than middle- and high-SES children to engage in such valued behaviors (e.g., participating in the collective exchanges and verbalizing one\u2019s experience in front of the class ; Millet &amp; Croizet, 2016; Montmasson-Michel, 2018; Streib, 2011). Other qualitative observations in preschool have also revealed that teachers tend to favor middle- and high-SES children\u2019s participation as they comply with their expectations (Florin, Braun-Lamesch &amp; Bramaud du Boucheron, 1985). Although these observations offer initial insights, they rely on qualitative observations and involve small sample of children. \nThis research aims at complementing these observations by assessing the generalizability of these results with quantitative methodology.

This variable has been shown to be a good proxy for overall SES (Goudeau, Autin, &amp; Croizet, 2017). ", "recommended-hypothesis.question4a": [], "recommended-hypothesis.question5a": "In many countries, socioeconomic status (SES), which can be captured by education, income, and/or occupational status, has a significant influence on academic achievement: the lower a student\u2019s SES, the more likely they are to experience difficulties and to drop out of school before attending university (OCDE, 2016). This influence of SES is observed very early during development: Compared to low-SES children, middle- and high-SES children have higher verbal skills at the age of 2 (Grobon, Panico, &amp; Solaz, 2019), and they possess more knowledge of the sounds and names of letters, as well as a higher level of familiarity with books at the age of 4 (Bowey, 1995; Lonigan, Burgess, Anthony, &amp; Barker, 1998; Sublet &amp; Pr\u00eateur, 1988). In many countries, despite important differences in the availability of early childhood education systems, preschool is designed to reduce these initial inequalities by providing low-SES children with greater familiarity and readiness in speaking, pre-reading and counting. However, existing studies do not fully support that preschool is a great equalizer as initial disparities in education are still existent at the beginning of first grade (Colmant, Jeantheau, &amp; Murat, 2002; Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002; Maurin, 2007; Rocher, 2015). The first objective of this study is to examine why preschool settings fail to level initial academic disparities related to SES backgrounds. Our hypothesis is that preschool settings could unintentionally not allowing an equal oral participation of children from different SES backgrounds. Moreover, the fact that inequalities are still persistent in first grade do not inform us regarding their evolution during preschool: are they attenuated, do they remain constant, or are they amplified? As existing studies stay silent regarding this evolution during preschool, our second objective is to investigate how inequalities evolve from the beginning to the end of preschool. \nStudies conducted in France and in the United States reveal that early and regular attendance is beneficial for achievement \u2013especially for low-SES children\u2013 as it provides an advantage at school entry (e.g., alphabet recognition, counting, and prewriting and reading skills; Huang, 2017). However, these types of advantages are not systematic and mostly depend on the quality of the preschool programs (Lipsey, Farran, &amp; Durkin, 2018). Moreover, there is substantial evidence that despite these benefits, attending preschool does not level the playing field as low-SES children enter first grade still lagging behind middle- and high-SES children in terms of speaking, reading, writing as well as counting skills (Colmant, Jeantheau, &amp; Murat, 2002; Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002; Maurin, 2007; Rocher, 2015). Furthering our understanding of the construction of inequalities at the preschool level is a major issue, as these initial inequalities lay the groundwork for subsequent differences throughout students\u2019 progression in the educational system. \nThe persistent relationship between SES and academic achievement can be explained by structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood or home environment, which have a direct impact on academic skills (American Psychological Association. Task Force on Socioeconomic Status, 2007; Duncan &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 1997). However, a growing body of evidence has also highlighted the role played by classroom contexts in the achievement gap between middle- high-SES students and low-SES students (Croizet, Goudeau, Marot, &amp; Millet, 2017). Understanding how academic contexts can play a role in the achievement gap related to SES backgrounds requires considering that academic settings and practices are not neutral. Indeed, classrooms settings are inherently saturated with cultural norms (e.g., language use, school knowledge or ways of being) that are closer to the cultural dispositions shaped in middle- and high-SES families than those developed in low-SES families (Bernstein, 1975; Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990; Lareau, 2003; Stephens, Markus, &amp; Fryberg, 2012; Stephens, Markus, &amp; Phillips, 2014). Recent research has documented that the cultural mismatch between academic norms and cultural dispositions developed through family socialization undermines low-SES students\u2019 achievement (Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017; Stephens, Fryberg, Markus, Johnson, &amp; Covarrubias, 2012).\nThe cultural mismatch between the home and school resides in two core dimensions: First, academic settings tend to promote and reward independence as the cultural standard for how to be a good student (Stephens, Fryberg et al., 2012). For example, teachers expect students to develop and to use their voice to express their own opinions and interests, to share their personal experience and make their own choices. This independent way of being which orients students to their own thoughts, feelings and actions is closer to middle- and high-SES family\u2019s socialization practices that invite children to put forward their interests, preferences and opinions in various activities of everyday life than to low-SES family\u2019s socialization practices (Lareau, 2003; Kusserow, 2004; Miller &amp; Cho, 2018; Miller, Cho &amp; Bracey, 2005; Schieffelin &amp; Ochs, 1986).

Second, we will select classrooms with SES diversity. To pre-select the school according to these criteria, we will benefit from the help of academic authorities. To maximize acceptance rate, we will organize meetings in the schools (with the directors and the teachers) to present the project in detail. This will familiarize the directors and the teachers with the project and they will thus be able to answer parents\u2019 questions and respond to potential concerns. \nProcedure and material\nThe study will consist in a series of observations in French preschools. Preschool days are very structured: The children alternate between free play times, collective greeting times or circle times, and educational activities in small groups. Typically, after an initial free play time, the preschool day begins with a circle time that consists of all children sitting in a circle, and the teacher giving a semi-structured lesson. These circle times exist in all French preschools and take place 2-4 times a day. They vary in content and style, including discussing the weather, counting the number of boys and girls in the circle, reading a book, talking about personal experiences or singing a song. In order to make comparison between classrooms possible, we will limit the observations to these circle times.\nAll videos will be recorded and time coded with Noldus Media Recorder (version 2.5, 2013). 6 to 8 collective circle times will be recorded by classroom. For greeting times (i.e., collective circle time), 6 cameras linked to the recording device (Noldus Media Recorder) will be installed in the \u201ccircle area\u201d (i.e., the place in the classroom where circle times take place) before the children arrived in the classroom the morning. For each observation, a research assistant will start the recording device before leaving the classroom in order to avoid interference with the course of the session. After that, the observations will be coded and the data analyzed, a meeting with the teachers involved in the study will be organized in order to debrief them and to present them the main results. \nData Coding\nFollowing the observation sessions, the obtained video-footage will be uploaded onto multiple secure hard-drives. Next, the video-footage of the four cameras will be synchronized and paired together using Noldus Observer XT software (Version 14.2, 2018). \nCoding children and teacher\u2019s behaviors. A coding scheme have been established before data collection with The Noldus Observer XT software (Version 14.2, 2018). For each child, we will code the duration and number of occurrences of speaking as an indicator of oral participation. More specifically, the coding scheme includes the following behaviors: \u201cspeak\u201d and \u201cnon speak\u201d. The former includes four modifiers: (1) \u201cspeak after being questioned by the teacher\u201d; (2) \u201cspeak without being questioned by the teacher\u201d; (3) \u201cspeak by interrupting another child\u201d; (4) \u201cspeak by interrupting the teacher\u201d. These modifiers will be regrouped in two meta-categories for the analyses: \u201cspeak after being questioned\u201d (i.e., modifier 1) and \u201cspeak without being questioned\u201d, which regroups modifiers (2), (3) and (4). The behavior \u201cspeak\u201d will not be coded when more than 3 children are speaking at the same time. All observations will be double coded by two independent coders. Intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) will be used to analyze the inter-observer reliability. Based on Cicchetti\u2019s (1964) classification, an ICC greater or equal to .60 reflects a good reliability between the two coders. We thus aim to reach ICC of at least .60 for the double coded observations. To ensure the anonymity of the collected data (coded behaviors, sex, date of birth and occupation of parents), the teacher will attribute a random numeric code to each child. This code will be used to match children\u2019s behaviors and administrative records.\nCoding SES. In social sciences, and in psychology in particular, different indicators are used to measure SES. The three main indicators are income, level of education and type of occupation (Kraus &amp; Stephens, 2012; Oakes &amp; Rossi, 2003). In this study, SES will be assessed according to parental occupations (Goudeau &amp; Croizet, 2017) as it is the only indicator available from French school authorities. This variable has been shown to be a good proxy for overall SES (Oakes &amp; Rossi, 2003; Goudeau, Autin, &amp; Croizet, 2017). SES ranking will be determined by the highest level of occupation held by either parent. For example, if the mother is a physician and the father a manual worker, the student will be assigned to the high SES group. Low-SES group will include children of manual and administrative workers, other blue-collar workers (employees, artisans, farmers, etc.), and unemployed persons. Middle-SES group will include children whose parents have intermediate occupations as technicians, nurses, educators, intermediate civil servant or military personnel. High-SES group will include children of managers, engineers, researchers and professors, as well as professional managerial elite (e.g., lawyers, architects, doctors, etc.).", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "(H1) low-SES children are less likely to be questioned by the teacher than middle- and high-SES children (we expect no difference between middle-SES children and high-SES children).\n\nIV.
