Recent models suggest that AUD patients could also suffer from dehumanization processes (Fontesse et al., 2019) without specifying if dehumanization is expressed through traits (such as uniquely human and human nature traits attributions; dehumanization dual model, Haslam, 2006) or abilities (such as agentism and experience; mind perception model, Gray, Gray, &amp; Wegner 2007) attributions. The present research has two aims. First, dimensions of both stereotypes and dehumanisation (traits and abilities) implied in stigma towards AUD patients will be specified. Second, a target multicategorization strategy (i.e., the use of multiple criteria to categorize others; Crisp &amp; Hewstone, 2007), based either on negatively vs. neutrally vs. positively perceived categorizations, to prevent both processes will be tested. Compared to a control condition, multicategorization conditions should enhance various traits or abilities attributions of people designed as \u201calcoholic persons\u201d (control &lt; MC- conditions). Fruther, as an exploratory hypothesis, we suggest that multicategorization conditions may enhance gradually various traits or abilities of people designed as \u201calcoholic persons\u201d, according the category valence implied in the multicategorization condition (MC-NEG &lt; MC-NEU &lt; MC-POS).", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-03-12T14:34:04.557172", "date_modified": "2020-03-12T14:05:02.684170", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "125adacd3f6bb3f04824910802a2acc10462fa33ca6007140f707de1702e97db238687d1aaad914968692afe7f07a4b86f969b8ed0eeebdecbd5415687969d4c94f3c98741050dde9a39faea2485cdea6a264507a4f7ad90ac3b9ee68fedb37dfdfd07d73649aa2a0d7b189b29b5f43b7040428acf029ca01870424a560af221d626c0223660c5d52107fdadaeb13df9", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-03-12T14:34:04.532522", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Pre-Registration in Social Psychology (van 't Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016): Pre-Registration", "registered_meta": {"looked": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "datacompletion": {"extra": [], "value": "No, data collection has not begun"}, "additionalComments": {"extra": [], "value": "As the coronavirus is closed to our town, data collection may be interrupted and will thus be finalized when the health official requirements will allow to come back to university."}, "dataCollectionDates": {"extra": [], "value": "From 12/03/2020 to 20/03/2020."}, "description-methods": {"value": {"design": {"value": {"question2a": {"extra": [], "value": "IV :\n- multicategorization (MC \u2013 Between-subject): categorical variable with 4 levels (control vs. MC negatively vs. neutrally vs. positively perceived categories)\n"}, "question2b": {"extra": [], "value": "DV:\n- warmth and competence: 3 items per dimension; participants will have to state to what extent the target may have different characteristics.

disorder (AUD) are suffering from social stigma (Schomerus et al., 2010) relying notably on negative stereotypes concerning their high potential of dangerousness and unpredictability notably compared to other mental disorders (Schomerus et al., 2011). Recent models suggest that AUD patients could also suffer from dehumanization processes (Fontesse et al., 2019) without specifying if dehumanization is expressed through traits (such as uniquely human and human nature traits attributions; dehumanization dual model, Haslam, 2006) or abilities (such as agentism and experience; mind perception model, Gray, Gray, &amp; Wegner 2007) attributions. The present research has two aims. First, dimensions of both stereotypes and dehumanisation (traits and abilities) implied in stigma towards AUD patients will be specified. Second, a target multicategorization strategy (i.e., the use of multiple criteria to categorize others; Crisp &amp; Hewstone, 2007), based either on 3 vs. 5 vs. 7 categorizations, to prevent both processes will be tested. Following Halford et al. (2005) demonstrating that people have difficulties to process combination of more than 4 categories, we hypothesize that below 5 categories included, multicategorization process will not perform to enhance intergroup perception. A 7-categories multicategorization condition is included to explore the possibility (or not) to enhance multicategorization efficiency by increasing the complexity of combinations.

We will analyze extracted data, and perform narrative syntheses and meta-analyses when possible.\nDiscussion: Our results could inform not only the overviews\u2019 methodology, but also the development of an online platform for the implementation strategies of knowledge products. This platform could be useful for stakeholders in implementation science.", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e3dcf05032a4d01a5e704b4", "file_name": "Protocol Registration.pdf", "file_urls": {"html":

as of 2013, when the previous Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) was published, it did not have enough research backing to be recognized as a diagnosis. Previous research notes the particular importance of CSBD in health psychology given its relationship to HIV and risky sexual behaviours (Miner &amp; Coleman, 2013), as well as similarities with addictive disorders (Kraus, Voon, &amp; Potenza, 2016). Increasing work has been completed on this disorder, particularly focused on risk factors and treatment (e.g. Blycker &amp; Potenza, 2018; Hallberg, Kaldo, Arver, Dhejne, &amp; Oberg, 2017; Parsons, Rendina, Moody, Ventuneac, &amp; Grov, 2015). One of the main aims of such research is to understand which factors may precipitate CSBD, and whether certain models may explain this. One such model is the Pathways Model from Gambling Disorder (Blaszczynski &amp; Nower, 2002), which suggests that Gambling Disorder occurs through three pathways: behavioural conditioning; behavioural conditioning and emotional vulnerability; and behavioural conditioning, emotional vulnerability, and antisocial/impulsive characteristics. To understand whether this model would also fit for CSBD it is important to understand which emotional vulnerabilities may be at play and how much they may affect this disorder. Research suggests that anxiety may be one such important risk factor.\nA recent meta-analysis (N = 95) showed that anxiety was one of the strongest significant syndemic indicators of sexual compulsivity (Rooney, Tulloch, &amp; Blashill, 2018). These results highlight the potential negative associations between anxiety and CSBD, and, when looked at alongside the Pathways Model, suggest that anxiety may be a significant emotional vulnerability factor that may perpetuate compulsive sexual behaviour. However, it focused solely on men who have male sexual partners. Another review focused on childhood sexual abuse and trauma (closely linked to anxiety symptoms) as a risk factor for CSBD (Slavin, Scoglio, Blycker, Potenza, &amp; Kraus, 2020). The authors noted that there was overall support for child sexual abuse as a risk factor for CSBD and opined that this relationship may be affected by other forms of trauma or that other types of trauma may have a stronger relationship. This suggests that anxiety, as a major component of trauma, may also be a risk factor for CSBD.\nTherefore, this systematic review aims to understand whether the current literature lends support to anxiety, focused on those with a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, as a risk factor for CSBD in adults and adolescents.\nMethod\nTo complete this systematic review, the following steps will be completed by the author, and other members of the SPARTA lab (no review protocol was completed):\n\u2022\tConduct a search of PsychInfo (1887 to current) and PubMed (1950\u2019s to present) with the following search terms:\no\t\"sex addiction\u201d, \u201chypersexuality\u201d, \u201chypersexual behavior\u201d, \u201chypersexual disorder\u201d, \u201chypersexual*\u201d, \u201cpornography addiction\u201d, \u201ccompulsive sexual behavior\u201d, \u201csexual compulsivity\u201d, or \u201csex* addiction\u201d, alongside \"anxiety\", \"panic\", or \"phobia\"\no\tRemove any duplicate studies\no\tAll studies found will be saved in Mendeley Reference Manager\n\uf0a7\tAn initial search produced 112 hits from PubMed and 232 hits from PsychInfo.
