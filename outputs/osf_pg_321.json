Participants will be informed about the results of a supposed previous study carried out with a representative sample of University of Caen Normandy undergraduate students. These results will be displayed in a graphical form, using percentages of response to one question. Two graphics will supposedly concern the actual behavior of this sample when they were asked to allocate resources to two groups: the French people of French origin and the French people's foreign origin. The results will activate an anti-discrimination descriptive norm (Cialdini et al., 1990) by showing that the majority of undergraduate students do not favor the French people of French origin over foreign origin. Most of them opt for an egalitarian distribution of resources in terms of housing (respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% inegalitarian distribution and 4.8% did not know) or education benefits (respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% inegalitarian distribution and 5.3% did not know). Then, to be sure that the supposed results will be taken into account by the participants, they will be asked to answer comprehension questions, as recommended by (Smith &amp; Louis, 2008). \n\nTo activate the injunctive norm, we will use the same material used for descriptive norm (Gabarrot, Falomir-Pichastor, &amp; Mugny, 2009). However, both graphs will supposedly be about the perceived legitimacy of social policies favoring the French people of French origin over the foreign origin. The results will activate an anti-discrimination injunctive norm by showing that the majority of University of Caen Normandy undergraduate students do not consider favoring French people of French origin over the foreign origin in terms of housing (respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% legitimate and 4.8% did not know) or education benefits (respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% legitimate and 5.3% did not know), to be legitimate. Then, to be sure that the supposed results will be taken into account by the participants, they will be asked to answer comprehension questions, as recommended by (Smith &amp; Louis, 2008).\n\nTo activate the social norms, participants will carry out both the descriptive norm activation (one graphic for housing and education benefits, respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% inegalitarian distribution and 4.8% did not know) and injunctive norm activation (one graphic for housing and education benefits, respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% legitimate and 5.3% did not know).\n\nRecall of past behaviors (the transgression phase). \nParticipants filled out a questionnaire concerning their past behaviors in discrimination situations. It included five discrimination situations  (i.e., keep away, avoidance behavior, criticizing, disregard, and staring at). They were asked to give some details about these situations, such as when it happened for the last time, where they were, and who were concerned by the situation. This classically used questionnaire (Fried, 1998) allows to ease the participants\u2019 transgression recall in order to make them conscious of their own counter-normative acts.\n\nDependent measures \n\nTarget-request acceptance: Participants will be asked if they accept to distribute flyers as part of an association of discrimination prevention towards individuals of foreign origin. The higher the likelihood to accept, the higher induced-hypocrisy effect. \n\nAmount of volunteering: Participants will be asked how much time they will be willing to spend to distribute flyers (from 1 to 8 half-hours). The higher the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect. \n\nDiscriminatory behaviors (measured via the Cyberball game). The participants will sit in front of a computer and will receive instructions on playing a Cyberball game (Pryor et al., 2013). Cyberball will be described to the participants as a mental visualization task where participants will be asked to imagine playing an actual game of \u201ccatch\u201d with other participants. In Cyberball, an animated ball is tossed from person to person on a computer screen. In these four-person games, the other three people will be represented on screen by three animated \u201cCyberboy\u201d figures. Above or to the side of each figure will have a head-shot photo of each player along with her first name. Players will be arranged in a circle on the screen. Play will begin with the person to the left tossing the ball. When the participants receive the ball, they could elect to toss it to any of the other players by clicking on the photo of the person with the computer mouse. The other three players will be \u201cvirtual confederates,\u201d as their play will be pre-programmed by the experimenter. The Cyberball game will be programmed to carry on for 60 ball tosses. Unbeknownst to participants, one of the three confederates is the Target Player, while the other two are designated Other Player 1 and Other Player 2, respectively. Using the photographs and the first name described above, the Target player is a French people of foreign origin while the other two players are French people of French origin. The Target Player\u2019s position on the screen is always on the left of the participant. The Target Player and the other two confederates randomly alternate among all of the players in their tosses throughout the game. To control the gender effect, all man's participants will play with a man Target and man other Players (Figure 1), and all woman\u2019s participants will play with a woman Target and woman other Players (Figure 2).\nBased on the recording of two information (i.e., the which player receives each toss, and the computer clock time at the point the ball is received) the cyberball game will allow to have three indicators of discriminatory behaviors: \n-\tThe number of tosses before inclusion (NTBI): A NTBI index will score 0 if the participants toss the ball to the target at the first opportunity. The NTBI index will score 1 if participants wait until the second time, they will catch the ball to toss to the target, 2 if they will wait until the third time, and so on. Thus, the NTBI will reflect participants\u2019 conscious choices of when to begin including the target in the game. The lesser the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect.\n-\tThe hesitation given inclusion (HGI): It will represent the average latency across trials in throwing the ball to the target player. Latency scores will derive from subtracting the clock time when the participant receive the ball from the subsequent clock time when the next player receive the ball. Hesitating when throwing the ball to a target person is a subtle behavior and would seem unlikely to be consciously controlled by participants. Only latency scores involving the target as recipient of the ball will contribute to the HGI index. The lesser the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect.\n-\tThe cumulative number of tosses (CNT) to each player form the participants across the entire game. The higher the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect.\n\n\n\n3.\tProcedure \n\nParticipants will be approached individually and will be given an informed consent for their participation in a study conducting on the understanding of intergroup relations. All participants will be na\u00efve to the hypothesis of the experiment. They will be equally balanced across the following five norm inconsistency conditions: none, descriptive, injunctive, personal, and social. \n\nIn the \u201cnone\u201d norm activation condition, the dependent measures will be proposed directly to the participants: to take part in an association in order to distribute anti-discrimination awareness flyers (i.e., the target request), the amount of volunteering to do it, and cyberball game (i.e., discriminatory behaviors indicators).\n\nIn the three other conditions (i.e., the conditions of descriptive, injunctive, and social norms activation), participants will begin to carry out the normative phase of Induced-Hypocrisy paradigm \u2013 which is different according to the three conditions - and will then fill out the transgression phase (i.e., a questionnaire, concerning their past discriminatory behaviors, which is the same across these conditions). At the end of the experimental, dependent variables will be assessed.\n\nAll participants will then complete a socio-demographic questionnaire before being debriefed and thanked for their participation. The entire procedure will take approximately 25 minutes.\n\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "- Undergraduate student at the University of Caen Normandy\n- Age greater than or equal to 18 years"}, "question5b": {"extra": [], "value": "The experimenter will contact participants directly on the campus of the University of Caen Normandy.

This study aims to prevent discriminatory behaviors through the Induced-Hypocrisy (IH) paradigm (Aronson, Fried, &amp; Stone, 1991).\n\nThe induced-hypocrisy (IH) paradigm (Aronson, Fried, &amp; Stone, 1991) is a two-step procedure: 1) promoting a norm and 2) recalling past transgressions of this norm. This inconsistency leads people to adopt behaviors in accordance with the promoted norm (e.g., Fointiat, 2008; S\u00e9n\u00e9meaud, Mange, Fointiat, &amp; Somat, 2014). Because of the main explanation of IH, which is based on the self-consistency theory (i.e., behavior change would allow to restore the self-concept threatened by the recall of past transgression; Aronson, 1992), few studies have investigated the role of norms. However, the theory of deviation from the norm (Li\u00e9geois et al., 2017) tends to make more central the role of norms in IH by viewing the behavioral change as the reduction of the perceived gap between a norm and a behavior. In line with this theory, recent research showed the moderating role of social norms in IH paradigm: when they are reinforced (weakened), higher (lesser), the IH effect is (Mauduy, Priolo, Margas, &amp; S\u00e9n\u00e9meaud, 2020). Furthermore, two kinds of social norms \u2013 descriptive and injunctive (Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991) \u2013 influence behaviors and the combined use of them reinforces their effect (Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998).

The use of contrast analyses will allow us to test specific hypotheses more efficiently than omnibus tests. First, the hypothesis 1 will be test with the following first contrast: none = -3; descriptive = 1; injunctive = 1; social = 1.

This study aims to prevent discriminatory behaviors through the Induced-Hypocrisy (IH) paradigm (Aronson, Fried, &amp; Stone, 1991).\n\nThe induced-hypocrisy (IH) paradigm (Aronson, Fried, &amp; Stone, 1991) is a two-step procedure: 1) promoting a norm and 2) recalling past transgressions of this norm. This inconsistency leads people to adopt behaviors in accordance with the promoted norm (e.g., Fointiat, 2008; S\u00e9n\u00e9meaud, Mange, Fointiat, &amp; Somat, 2014). Because of the main explanation of IH, which is based on the self-consistency theory (i.e., behavior change would allow to restore the self-concept threatened by the recall of past transgression; Aronson, 1992), few studies have investigated the role of norms. However, the theory of deviation from the norm (Li\u00e9geois et al., 2017) tends to make more central the role of norms in IH by viewing the behavioral change as the reduction of the perceived gap between a norm and a behavior. In line with this theory, recent research showed the moderating role of social norms in IH paradigm: when they are reinforced (weakened), higher (lesser), the IH effect is (Mauduy, Priolo, Margas, &amp; S\u00e9n\u00e9meaud, 2020). Furthermore, two kinds of social norms \u2013 descriptive and injunctive (Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991) \u2013 influence behaviors and the combined use of them reinforces their effect (Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998). Thus, this study aims to deepen the moderating role of social norms in the IH paradigm by testing the contribution of each social norm as well as their association with the IH effect.\n", "recommended-hypothesis.question6a": "", "description-methods.design.question2a": "-Norm activation: categorical variable with four levels (none, descriptive, injunctive, and social), between-participant", "description-methods.design.question2b": "1.\tTarget-request acceptance (yes or no): Commitment to volunteer to distribute flyers as part of an association of discrimination prevention towards individuals of foreign origin\nBinomial variable: yes or no\n\n2.\tAmount of volunteering:  Time that participants will spend to distribute flyers (from 1 to 8 half-hours).\nOrdinal variable with eight levels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n\n3.\tIndicators of discriminatory behaviors: Cyberball is recording (Pryor, Reeder, Wesselmann, Williams, &amp; Wirth, 2013): \n\n-\tThe number of tosses before inclusion (NTBI): A NTBI index was scored 0 if the participants tossed the ball to the target at the first opportunity.

Participants will be informed about the results of a supposed previous study carried out with a representative sample of University of Caen Normandy undergraduate students. These results will be displayed in a graphical form, using percentages of response to one question. Two graphics will supposedly concern the actual behavior of this sample when they were asked to allocate resources to two groups: the French people of French origin and the French people's foreign origin. The results will activate an anti-discrimination descriptive norm (Cialdini et al., 1990) by showing that the majority of undergraduate students do not favor the French people of French origin over foreign origin. Most of them opt for an egalitarian distribution of resources in terms of housing (respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% inegalitarian distribution and 4.8% did not know) or education benefits (respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% inegalitarian distribution and 5.3% did not know). Then, to be sure that the supposed results will be taken into account by the participants, they will be asked to answer comprehension questions, as recommended by (Smith &amp; Louis, 2008). \n\nTo activate the injunctive norm, we will use the same material used for descriptive norm (Gabarrot, Falomir-Pichastor, &amp; Mugny, 2009). However, both graphs will supposedly be about the perceived legitimacy of social policies favoring the French people of French origin over the foreign origin. The results will activate an anti-discrimination injunctive norm by showing that the majority of University of Caen Normandy undergraduate students do not consider favoring French people of French origin over the foreign origin in terms of housing (respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% legitimate and 4.8% did not know) or education benefits (respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% legitimate and 5.3% did not know), to be legitimate. Then, to be sure that the supposed results will be taken into account by the participants, they will be asked to answer comprehension questions, as recommended by (Smith &amp; Louis, 2008).\n\nTo activate the social norms, participants will carry out both the descriptive norm activation (one graphic for housing and education benefits, respectively 89.26% vs. 5.9% inegalitarian distribution and 4.8% did not know) and injunctive norm activation (one graphic for housing and education benefits, respectively, 82.25%, vs. 12.45% legitimate and 5.3% did not know).\n\nRecall of past behaviors (the transgression phase). \nParticipants filled out a questionnaire concerning their past behaviors in discrimination situations. It included five discrimination situations  (i.e., keep away, avoidance behavior, criticizing, disregard, and staring at). They were asked to give some details about these situations, such as when it happened for the last time, where they were, and who were concerned by the situation. This classically used questionnaire (Fried, 1998) allows to ease the participants\u2019 transgression recall in order to make them conscious of their own counter-normative acts.\n\nDependent measures \n\nTarget-request acceptance: Participants will be asked if they accept to distribute flyers as part of an association of discrimination prevention towards individuals of foreign origin. The higher the likelihood to accept, the higher induced-hypocrisy effect. \n\nAmount of volunteering: Participants will be asked how much time they will be willing to spend to distribute flyers (from 1 to 8 half-hours). The higher the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect. \n\nDiscriminatory behaviors (measured via the Cyberball game). The participants will sit in front of a computer and will receive instructions on playing a Cyberball game (Pryor et al., 2013). Cyberball will be described to the participants as a mental visualization task where participants will be asked to imagine playing an actual game of \u201ccatch\u201d with other participants. In Cyberball, an animated ball is tossed from person to person on a computer screen. In these four-person games, the other three people will be represented on screen by three animated \u201cCyberboy\u201d figures. Above or to the side of each figure will have a head-shot photo of each player along with her first name. Players will be arranged in a circle on the screen. Play will begin with the person to the left tossing the ball. When the participants receive the ball, they could elect to toss it to any of the other players by clicking on the photo of the person with the computer mouse. The other three players will be \u201cvirtual confederates,\u201d as their play will be pre-programmed by the experimenter. The Cyberball game will be programmed to carry on for 60 ball tosses. Unbeknownst to participants, one of the three confederates is the Target Player, while the other two are designated Other Player 1 and Other Player 2, respectively. Using the photographs and the first name described above, the Target player is a French people of foreign origin while the other two players are French people of French origin. The Target Player\u2019s position on the screen is always on the left of the participant. The Target Player and the other two confederates randomly alternate among all of the players in their tosses throughout the game. To control the gender effect, all man's participants will play with a man Target and man other Players (Figure 1), and all woman\u2019s participants will play with a woman Target and woman other Players (Figure 2).\nBased on the recording of two information (i.e., the which player receives each toss, and the computer clock time at the point the ball is received) the cyberball game will allow to have three indicators of discriminatory behaviors: \n-\tThe number of tosses before inclusion (NTBI): A NTBI index will score 0 if the participants toss the ball to the target at the first opportunity. The NTBI index will score 1 if participants wait until the second time, they will catch the ball to toss to the target, 2 if they will wait until the third time, and so on. Thus, the NTBI will reflect participants\u2019 conscious choices of when to begin including the target in the game. The lesser the score, the higher the induced-hypocrisy effect.\n-\tThe hesitation given inclusion (HGI): It will represent the average latency across trials in throwing the ball to the target player. Latency scores will derive from subtracting the clock time when the participant receive the ball from the subsequent clock time when the next player receive the ball. Hesitating when throwing the ball to a target person is a subtle behavior and would seem unlikely to be consciously controlled by participants. Only latency scores involving the target as recipient of the ball will contribute to the HGI index.

All participants will be na\u00efve to the hypothesis of the experiment. They will be equally balanced across the following five norm inconsistency conditions: none, descriptive, injunctive, personal, and social. \n\nIn the \u201cnone\u201d norm activation condition, the dependent measures will be proposed directly to the participants: to take part in an association in order to distribute anti-discrimination awareness flyers (i.e., the target request), the amount of volunteering to do it, and cyberball game (i.e., discriminatory behaviors indicators).\n\nIn the three other conditions (i.e., the conditions of descriptive, injunctive, and social norms activation), participants will begin to carry out the normative phase of Induced-Hypocrisy paradigm \u2013 which is different according to the three conditions - and will then fill out the transgression phase (i.e., a questionnaire, concerning their past discriminatory behaviors, which is the same across these conditions). At the end of the experimental, dependent variables will be assessed.\n\nAll participants will then complete a socio-demographic questionnaire before being debriefed and thanked for their participation.

Participants will be asked to either lie or tell the truth in their accounts. Truth tellers will be asked to provide two completely honest accounts about the same event that they experienced in the past two years. Liars will be asked to completely fabricate two accounts about the same event that they have never experienced. These two accounts are being generated for coding in Part Two of the study, and consequently we discuss how the statements will be used there. \nIn between providing the two accounts, participants will be asked to complete the HEXACO-60 personality questionnaire as a filler task. The HEXACO-60 is a well-established tool consisting of 60 questions measuring Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O). The HEXACO-60 (Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009; Appendix Four) questionnaire takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. \nAfter completing their own accounts, they will be asked to read four sets of paired statements (hereby referred to as \u2018stimulus materials\u2019) collected from a previous study, and highlight any aspects that indicate (in)consistency.

Participants will be randomly allocated four pairs of stimulus materials to consider out of a bank of 16 pairs of stimulus materials. Participants will not know the veracity of any of the stimulus materials, and will not be asked to make a veracity judgement of the stimulus materials.\nProcedure: After participants have expressed interest in the study they will be emailed a copy of the Participant Information Sheet (Appendix One) and consent form (Appendix Two) at least 24 hours prior to the study session, to make sure they have all information available to them before they arrange times to participate. We will recruit 30 participants (15 truth tellers and 15 liars). On the day of the study, all participants will attend the laboratory at a pre-organised time. All participants will again be given a copy of the Information Sheet to read. They will then be verbally informed of the procedure by the researcher (Oral Consent Script, Appendix Three), and asked to thoroughly read the information sheet and informed consent form before signing. Participants will be given a copy of their signed consent form to keep and provided with an opportunity to ask any questions. Participants will then be randomly allocated to a truth telling or a lying group to provide their accounts. \nTruth tellers will be asked to recall a positive memorable event that occurred within the past two years, and we will provide the examples of going on holiday or having a celebratory birthday dinner (however, it will be clear that these are examples, and they are not limited to these options). They will be instructed to choose an event that they are comfortable writing about completely honestly and can remember in detail. Liars will be asked to invent a positive memorable event, and told that it should have occurred within the past two years. They will also be provided with the examples of going on holiday or having a celebratory birthday dinner. Both truth tellers and liars will be asked not to include any details in their account that could be used to identify them.\nData will be collected using Qualtrics. Participants will be asked to write either their truthful or deceptive first account of their memorable event as a response to an open-ended question, after which they will be presented with the HEXACO-60. After completing the HEXACO-60 personality questionnaire as a filler task, participants will be asked to think about the event they previously reported. A context reinstatement instruction will inform them to consider what sensory information they can recall, such as things they saw, could hear, or could smell. This instruction will encourage participants to remember the event, rather than just thinking about their previous account. After 30 seconds of the screen displaying this instruction, participants will be asked to again write another account about the same experience.\nOnce participants have provided two accounts regarding the same memorable event, they will then be asked to consider some other participants\u2019 memorable events (i.e. the stimulus materials). The participant will be given a paper copy of two statements and asked to rate how consistent they believe the statements to be on a scale of 0% (highly inconsistent) to 100% (highly consistent). Ratings will be taken on a 0% - 100% scale to allow us to calculate an average \u201ccut off\u201d point, to differentiate how (in)consistent a statement needs to be to be considered (in)consistent based upon the comments on the stimulus materials. Once they have made their judgement, participants will then be asked to use a highlighter pen to notate a few key aspects of the statements that they consider to be (in)consistent, and add written notes to explain why they think that part is (in)consistent. Participants will be asked to do this for four pairs of statements, and then asked to write a brief statement explaining what they believe consistency is. These stimulus materials are taken from Hudson et al. (under review). This statement and the notes will be used in a thematic analysis to develop a clearer picture of how laypeople understand consistency and the LUCK scheme.\nA pilot study will be run with 5 participants to test the methodology and ensure clarity within the instructions. It is anticipated that the study will take no more than 45 minutes.\n\nPart Two\nMaterials: The thematic analysis conducted in Part One of the study will be used to inform a coding scheme based upon the layperson understanding of consistency (the Layperson Understanding of Consistency Key; LUCK). The LUCK scheme will tested for reliability using the memorable event accounts collected from the participants in Part One of the study by a team of independent coders.\nProcedure: Six independent coders will be asked to categorise the 30 pairs of statements collected in Part One as either consistent or inconsistent using the LUCK scheme derived from Part One of the study. Coders will be blind to statement veracity and asked to make holistic decisions on whether a statement is consistent or inconsistent, based upon the LUCK scheme derived from Part One of the study. Coders will also be asked to code for the number of repetitions, reminiscences, omissions, and contradictions found within a statement. We will mathematically calculate whether a statement is consistent or inconsistent using the proportion of inconsistent details (i.e. omissions, reminiscence, and contradictions) to consistent details (i.e. repetitions).\n\n\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "Part One\nThe ability to read and understand English to a high level is required to complete the accounts and to read the stimulus materials.

Participants will be asked to either provide a truthful or deceptive statement (to be used to test the coding scheme in Part Two of the study), and asked to rate and comment on four pairs of statements for consistency (to be analysed using a thematic analysis). \nPart Two of the study will be testing the coding scheme, using a within subjects design. Coders will be asked to classify 30 pairs of statements (generated in Part One) as either consistent or inconsistent, using the coding scheme generated from the thematic analysis.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Part One\nMaterials: Part One will utilise an online questionnaire (Qualtrics) where participants will be asked to write two short accounts about a positive memorable event (for example, their last vacation or a friend\u2019s wedding) in no more than 500 words (accounts will be limited to prevent order effects for reporting the same account twice). Participants will be asked to either lie or tell the truth in their accounts. Truth tellers will be asked to provide two completely honest accounts about the same event that they experienced in the past two years. Liars will be asked to completely fabricate two accounts about the same event that they have never experienced. These two accounts are being generated for coding in Part Two of the study, and consequently we discuss how the statements will be used there. \nIn between providing the two accounts, participants will be asked to complete the HEXACO-60 personality questionnaire as a filler task. The HEXACO-60 is a well-established tool consisting of 60 questions measuring Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O). The HEXACO-60 (Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009; Appendix Four) questionnaire takes approximately 12 minutes to complete. \nAfter completing their own accounts, they will be asked to read four sets of paired statements (hereby referred to as \u2018stimulus materials\u2019) collected from a previous study, and highlight any aspects that indicate (in)consistency.  This is not for the explicit purpose of detecting deception, therefore participants will be informed that we are interested in how people understand consistency across statements. Stimulus materials used in Part One of the study are the same as those used in Hudson et al. (under review). To generate stimulus materials for rating, 17 individuals (6 male, 11 female, aged 18-52, Mage = 28.44, SDage = 9.35) were randomly allocated to either telling the truth or lying about a memorable event that took place in the past two years. They were interviewed by an instruction-blind interviewer. Truth tellers were asked to recall a positive memorable event that occurred within the past two years, and were given examples such as of going on holiday or having a celebratory birthday dinner. They were instructed to choose an event that they were comfortable talking about honestly and could remember in detail. Those who were asked to lie were asked to invent the details of a positive memorable event provided by the researcher (for example \u201cSpending Christmas on a beach\u201d). Following a delay of one week, all participants returned to be interviewed by the same interviewer for a second time. Participants were either truthful in both interviews or deceptive in both interviews. Interviews were audio recorded and conducted using a script, featuring one open ended request for the interviewee to tell the interviewer everything about their memorable event. Participants of the previous study were aware their statements would be used in subsequent research, and consented to their statements being used in this way. Any identifiable features that were provided in the statements (such as names) were changed for anonymity. \nThe transcripts will be used as stimulus materials to prompt participants to highlight features of the stimulus materials that they find (in)consistent. We will only use the first 16 sets of the paired statements, and disregarded the statements provided by the 17th participant. All 17 participants gave written consent for their statements to be used in future research. An even number of stimulus materials will be selected to ensure that an equal number of truth teller and liar statements could be presented. Participants will be randomly allocated four pairs of stimulus materials to consider out of a bank of 16 pairs of stimulus materials. Participants will not know the veracity of any of the stimulus materials, and will not be asked to make a veracity judgement of the stimulus materials.\nProcedure: After participants have expressed interest in the study they will be emailed a copy of the Participant Information Sheet (Appendix One) and consent form (Appendix Two) at least 24 hours prior to the study session, to make sure they have all information available to them before they arrange times to participate. We will recruit 30 participants (15 truth tellers and 15 liars). On the day of the study, all participants will attend the laboratory at a pre-organised time. All participants will again be given a copy of the Information Sheet to read. They will then be verbally informed of the procedure by the researcher (Oral Consent Script, Appendix Three), and asked to thoroughly read the information sheet and informed consent form before signing. Participants will be given a copy of their signed consent form to keep and provided with an opportunity to ask any questions. Participants will then be randomly allocated to a truth telling or a lying group to provide their accounts. \nTruth tellers will be asked to recall a positive memorable event that occurred within the past two years, and we will provide the examples of going on holiday or having a celebratory birthday dinner (however, it will be clear that these are examples, and they are not limited to these options). They will be instructed to choose an event that they are comfortable writing about completely honestly and can remember in detail. Liars will be asked to invent a positive memorable event, and told that it should have occurred within the past two years. They will also be provided with the examples of going on holiday or having a celebratory birthday dinner. Both truth tellers and liars will be asked not to include any details in their account that could be used to identify them.\nData will be collected using Qualtrics. Participants will be asked to write either their truthful or deceptive first account of their memorable event as a response to an open-ended question, after which they will be presented with the HEXACO-60. After completing the HEXACO-60 personality questionnaire as a filler task, participants will be asked to think about the event they previously reported. A context reinstatement instruction will inform them to consider what sensory information they can recall, such as things they saw, could hear, or could smell. This instruction will encourage participants to remember the event, rather than just thinking about their previous account. After 30 seconds of the screen displaying this instruction, participants will be asked to again write another account about the same experience.\nOnce participants have provided two accounts regarding the same memorable event, they will then be asked to consider some other participants\u2019 memorable events (i.e. the stimulus materials). The participant will be given a paper copy of two statements and asked to rate how consistent they believe the statements to be on a scale of 0% (highly inconsistent) to 100% (highly consistent). Ratings will be taken on a 0% - 100% scale to allow us to calculate an average \u201ccut off\u201d point, to differentiate how (in)consistent a statement needs to be to be considered (in)consistent based upon the comments on the stimulus materials. Once they have made their judgement, participants will then be asked to use a highlighter pen to notate a few key aspects of the statements that they consider to be (in)consistent, and add written notes to explain why they think that part is (in)consistent. Participants will be asked to do this for four pairs of statements, and then asked to write a brief statement explaining what they believe consistency is. These stimulus materials are taken from Hudson et al. (under review). This statement and the notes will be used in a thematic analysis to develop a clearer picture of how laypeople understand consistency and the LUCK scheme.\nA pilot study will be run with 5 participants to test the methodology and ensure clarity within the instructions. It is anticipated that the study will take no more than 45 minutes.\n\nPart Two\nMaterials: The thematic analysis conducted in Part One of the study will be used to inform a coding scheme based upon the layperson understanding of consistency (the Layperson Understanding of Consistency Key; LUCK). The LUCK scheme will tested for reliability using the memorable event accounts collected from the participants in Part One of the study by a team of independent coders.\nProcedure: Six independent coders will be asked to categorise the 30 pairs of statements collected in Part One as either consistent or inconsistent using the LUCK scheme derived from Part One of the study. Coders will be blind to statement veracity and asked to make holistic decisions on whether a statement is consistent or inconsistent, based upon the LUCK scheme derived from Part One of the study. Coders will also be asked to code for the number of repetitions, reminiscences, omissions, and contradictions found within a statement. We will mathematically calculate whether a statement is consistent or inconsistent using the proportion of inconsistent details (i.e. omissions, reminiscence, and contradictions) to consistent details (i.e. repetitions).\n\n\n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Participants in Part One of the study will be randomly allocated to tell the truth or lie about a memorable event.

Detailed notes will be taken to generate initial codes. From this we will make inferences about what the codes mean. Codes will then be combined into overarching themes to accurately represent the data, and we will establish how the themes support the data. Each theme will be clearly defined, and we will establish how each theme contributes to the holistic understanding of consistency.

Interrater reliability of application of each coding scheme for each of the 30 pairs of statements will be calculated using Cohen\u2019s kappa, to determine reliability of the scales.

Only a few studies have directly compared these two states within a single experiment (David et al., 2017; FeldmanHall et al., 2015; Gummerum et al., 2016; Omara et al., 2011), but none of these offered self-compensation and escape together as behavioral options in response to unfairness. Additionally, no studies of empathic anger have directly measured self-focused and other-focused goals as mediators of anger effects on behavioral decisions. Study 1 will also constrain participants to choose one behavioral response (either helping, punishment, self-compensation, or escape) so as to conceptually replicate findings that individuals are more likely to choose self-compensation than punishment when they are personally angered by an offender (FeldmanHall et al., 2015), but are more likely to compensate a victim or punish an offender when a third party is treated unfairly (Gummerum et al., 2016; van Prooijen, 2010).\n\nDesign and Participants:\nStudy 1 will have two conditions: Empathic Anger and Personal Anger. Based on a pilot study's finding that personal and empathic anger predict different levels of prosocial activity motivation at d = .46, we conducted a power analysis to determine the number of participants needed to detect this effect size  within a moderation analysis (which would involve measuring 2 factors and an interaction). A power analysis in G*Power indicated that 151 participants would be needed to detect an interaction effect size of d = .46 between two groups and a continuous factor with 80% power and \u03b1 = .05. Based on this power analysis, study 1 will recruit a minimum of 200 adult participants recruited through MTurk, who will be compensated $1.00 each. \n\nMeasures and Procedure:\nParticipants will complete the study through an electronic questionnaire system (Qualtrics) which will present study tasks and information. After indicating their informed consent, they will first read the instructions for the MTPP (see below for full description) and respond to a short quiz indicating they understand the instructions. Participants will enter their name, and both they and the other participants will be referred to by name (rather than \u201cthird player\u201d, etc.). Participants will then complete the following measures/tasks:\n\nBaseline Positive and Negative Affect. To control for individual differences in positive and negative affect entering the study, participants will first respond to the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988). Participants report how strongly they feel emotions with positive valence (e.g., \u201cAlert\u201d) and negative valence (e.g., \u201cAfraid\u201d) on a 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely) scale.\n\nModerator Variables: Participants will complete two trait variable questionnaires, including:\n \na. Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale. Participants' trait mindfulness will be measured by the MAAS (Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). The scale is listed on a 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never) scale with questions asking about tendencies to act mindlessly (e.g., \"I could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later\").\n\nb. Five-Factor Trait Curiosity (Kashdan et al., 2018). Lastly participants will complete a trait measure of curiosity, the five-factor curiosity scale. Participants respond to questions about their curiosity habits (e.g., \"I like to learn about the habits of others\") on a 1 (Does not describe me at all) to 7 (Describes me completely) scale.\n\nAnger Condition and Modified Third-Party Punishment Task. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the Personal Anger or Empathic Anger condition and will complete the MTPP task. In the prototypical Third-Party Punishment task (Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2003), participants witness a \"dictator\" participant allocate unfair amounts of money to a \"recipient\" participant. This unfair allocation has been shown to elicit personal anger when the participant is the recipient, and empathic anger when the participant is a third-party witness to the allocation decision (Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2003). In the MTPP, the same type of allocation paradigm is used but task assignments, rather than money, are allocated. This modified task will allow us to examine how reactions to unfairness generalize beyond monetary decisions.\n\nIn the MTPP, participants are given a cover story that the study is researching group behavior, specifically \u201chow groups of people task delegation decisions in groups online vs. in-person.\u201d The participant will ostensibly be paired with two other partners online through a university research server. In actuality, the participant is the only player, and the two partners are computerized.\n\nParticipants will read that the first part of the study will involve the group members choosing how to delegate a set of tasks. The tasks involve rating and describing three sets of pictures which have been shown to elicit minimal affective responses (e.g., a floppy disc or lamp). There are to be two rounds of photos to describe in the study. One of the participants will be randomly assigned to choose how many photos each group member must complete (the group leader). Participants then rate and describe one example photo, and then will respond to attention check questions to indicate they understand the point of the study.\n\nThe computer player \"Alex\" is chosen to be the delegator for the photo tasks. Participants are shown the following allocations based on their experimental condition fr Round 1 (object photos).\n\n- Personal Anger: Total number of photos is 15. Participant is assigned 10 photos to describe; second group member is assigned 5 photos to describe; group leader assigns him/herself 0 photos.\n\n- Empathic Anger: Total number of photos is 30. Participant is assigned 10 photos to describe; second group member is assigned 20 photos to describe; group leader assigns him/herself 0 photos.\n\nParticipants then have the opportunity to write a public message to the other participants. Because the players are all computerized, the participant will see predetermined answers, with their own comment added to make it look like all players have posted messages to each other. On the next page, all of the players' messages are posted.\n\nNext, participants will actually complete the photo description assignment, and will rate and describe 10 photos (descriptions must be 100 characters at least). After completing this assignment, participants will either see a waiting screen making them wait for a few seconds while the other players complete the task (if in the empathic anger condition), or they will immediately move to the next part of the group study.\n\nEmpathy and State Affect. After Round 1 of the MTPP task and after seeing the allocation choice for Round 2, participants will report their empathic and personal anger, empathic concern, personal distress, and positive affect immediately before making the Round 2 reallocation decision. All emotions will be rated from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Extremely).\n\nEmpathic Anger. The State Empathic Anger Scale (SEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003) measures anger felt on behalf of another person. including eight emotional adjectives (mad, angry, furious, resentful, irritated, enraged, aggravated, outraged).\n\nEmpathic Concern and Distress. Empathic concern and distress will be measured through Batson\u2019s Emotional Adjective Scale (BEAS; Batson, Fultz, &amp; Schoenrade, 1987), consisting of 14 emotional adjectives measuring other-oriented concern (sympathetic, warm, softhearted, moved, compassionate, tender) and self-focused personal distress (troubled, upset, worried, disturbed, grieved, alarmed, perturbed, distressed).\n\nPositive Affect. Positive affect will be measured with the Happiness and Relaxation subscales of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (Harmon-Jones et al., 2016).\n\nOn the next page, participants will be told the group leader will choose the next task allocation, which will be completed at the end of the study. They are told there are now 40 photos to be completed, and both the participant and the other group member have been assigned 20 of the 40 photos. The group leader (Alex) assigns themselves 0.\n\nAfter seeing the Round 2 allocation, participants report their state empathy and affect once more. Next, participants are also then told that they have been selected as the moderator for Round 2 of the study. Participants then choose whether they want to reallocate photos for themselves, the group leader, or the partner participant. Once they make this decision, they then choose how many photos to reallocate (0 - 20). Later, participants will learn that they do not in fact need to complete this final rating/description task.\n\nReallocation Decision. In Round 2, participants will have the option to reallocate photos for themselves (self-compensation), the third player (third party helping), or the group leader (punishment). They also have the option of not changing any photos (Escape).\n\nDecisional Goals. To assess participants\u2019 goals when choosing their helping/punishment/escape decision, participants will complete the Goals Following Interpersonal Transgressions scale (GFIT; Rasmussen &amp; Boon, 2017). The full scale measures 12 dimensions of behavioral motivation following an interpersonal transgression. For the current study, only the Power, Moral, Reputation, Protect Others, Self-Protect, Emotional Well-Being, Justice, and Education subscales will be included. Participants rate on a 1 (not at all strongly) to 7 (very strongly) scale the extent to which they held each goal in making their decision. In analyses, the Power, Reputation, Self-Protect, Avoiding Conflict, and Emotional Well-Being dimensions will be assessed as self-focused goals, and the Moral, Protect Others, Justice, Education, and Forgiveness subscales will be assessed as other-focused goals.\n\nPost-Decision Affect. Participants will be asked to report their state affect once more using the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire in order to assess whether helping or punishment decisions positively influenced participants\u2019 mood.\n\nTrait Measures. Finally, participants will complete a questionnaire including a number of trait measures. These measures will be assessed after the primary measures of interest so as to not prime participants with concepts of anger or empathy.\n\nTrait Empathic Anger. Trait empathic anger is the extent to which participants tend to feel empathic anger in their daily lives, and will be measured using the Trait Empathic Anger Scale (TEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003), a seven-item Likert-scale ranging from 1 (Does Not Describe Me Very Well) to 5 (Describes Me Very Well); e.g. \u201cI feel angry for other people when they have been victimized by others.\u201d\n\nTrait Anger and Aggression. The dispositional tendency to get angry across different situations will be measured with the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (Webster et al., 2015). This measure asks participants to report how they would describe themselves on a 1 (Does not describe me at all) to 5 (Describes me very well) scale, (e.g., \u201cGiven enough provocation, I may hit another person\u201d).\n\nNeed to Belong. The dispositional need to belong and feel social support will be measured by the Need to Belong Scale (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &amp; Schreindorfer, 2013). This asks participants to report on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale to what extent they generally are distressed by social exclusion or desire social connection (e.g., \u201cIf other people don't seem to accept me, I don't let it bother me\u201d).\n\nSadistic Impulses. Participants' tendencies to want to hurt others in everyday life will be measured by the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS, O\u2019Meara et al., 2011). The scale is listed on a 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) scale (e.g., \u201cHurting people would be exciting\u201d).\n\nFinal Description: Participants are finally informed that they will not be asked to complete the Round 2 rating assignment. They will then be asked to complete their demographics and a final short cooldown task before finishing the study.\n\nDemographics. Participants\u2019 gender, race, and age will be self-reported.\n\nCooldown task: Participants will be asked to complete the same emotional cooldown task described in Study 3 in order to mitigate the psychological effects of having been induced to feel anger.\n\nEnd-of-study Mood. To determine whether participants are leaving the study in a positive or neutral emotional state, they will lastly be asked to complete a short mood questionnaire. This measure will be used only to monitor participants' responses, and thus will only include only 1 item in order to minimize participant frustration given the high quantity of affective self-report questionnaires in the study. The item will ask \"Overall, how positive or negative is your mood right now?\" and will utilize a sliding scale ranging from -100 ('Extremely negative; the worst I've felt in a long time') to 100 ('Extremely positive; the best I've felt in a long time') with a midpoint of 0 ('Completely neutral; neither positive or negative').\n\nAfterward, participants will be fully debriefed with a written letter explaining the purpose of the study and the deception elements.\n\n\n\n*STUDY 2*\nStudy 2 will again compare the effects of personal and empathic anger on motivation to help, punish, or self-compensate while additionally assessing the effect of high or low personal cost through adding a \u201cpayment\u201d aspect to participant decisions. High-cost payments will consist of SONA credits whereas low-cost payments will consist of raffle ticket entries for a separate prize above and beyond SONA credit compensation. SONA credits are expected to be perceived as more valuable as participants (undergraduate students enrolled in Introduction to Psychology) must obtain a certain number of credits in order to pass their Introduction to Psychology class. If empathic anger predicts similar levels of helping, punishment, and other-focused goals in the high and low-cost conditions, this will be more direct evidence of altruism than what has been posited in past literature.\n\nStudy 2 includes the same hypotheses as Study 1 as well as a moderation hypothesis:\n\nH6. Decision cost will interact with experimental condition to predict participants' decision to self-compensate, helping, and punishment decisions, such that:\na.   Across all conditions, participants will be more likely to self-compensate in the high cost condition compared to the low cost condition.\nb.   The difference between decision outcomes in the high and low cost conditions will be stronger in the personal anger condition than the empathic anger condition. \n\nMethod\nDesign: Study 2 will have a 2 (Empathic vs. Personal Anger) x 2 (High vs. Low Cost) factorial design. Using the same d = .46 effect size as Study 1, a power analysis indicated that 211participants would be adequate to detect main and interaction effect sizes of similar magnitude with 80% power and \u03b1 = .05 using ANCOVA (controlling for time of semester and baseline affect).\n\nParticipants: Participants in Study 2 will be either undergraduate students at VCU participating for course credit (1 SONA credit) and entered to win a raffle for several gift cards.\n\nProcedure. Participants will complete the study in groups of three or more in a computer lab setting at Virginia Commonwealth University for 1 SONA credit (or will complete the study online through the MTurk website at www.mturk.com). After informed consent they will complete the following measures and tasks.\n\nBaseline Positive and Negative Affect. Participants will first complete the PANAS as a measure of baseline positive and negative affect.\n\nModerator Variables: Participants will complete the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale and the Five-Factor Trait Curiosity Scale.\n\nModified Third-Party Punishment Game. Participants will first read the instructions for the MTPP as described in Study 1, and will respond to a short quiz indicating they understand the instructions. Participants will then enter their name, and both they and the other participants will be referred to by name (rather than \u201cthird player\u201d or group leader). They will then be randomly assigned to the Personal Anger or Empathic Anger condition of the study, and will complete the MTPP as described in Study 1.\n\nOnce participants have been brought to the Round 2 reallocation task, they will be randomly assigned to the High Cost or Low Cost condition. Unlike Study 1 where participants could choose how to reallocate the photos freely, now participants must \"pay\" to reallocate photo tasks.\n\nHigh Cost Condition. In the high-cost condition, participants will have to \"pay\" for photo reallocation with SONA credit or from their MTurk compensation. They will be instructed that they can pay up to .05 SONA credits or $0.05 from their final compensation amount in order to reallocate photos in each round, with .05 credits/dollars per photo. The amount of credit they pay to reallocate will ostensibly be taken from their final credit amount. (In actuality, participants will receive their full credit amount at the end of the study).\n\nLow Cost Condition. In the low-cost condition, participants will have to pay for photo reallocation with entries to the gift card raffle. They will be told that each participant receives 20 raffle ticket entries, and they can pay between 0 and 20 entries to reallocate photos, with one raffle entry being equal to one photo reallocations. The number of raffle entries they pay will ostensibly be taken from their final compensation amount. (In actuality, participants will receive the full number of entries at the end of the study).\n\nDecisional Goals. To assess participants\u2019 goals when choosing their helping/punishment/escape decision, participants will complete the Goals Following Interpersonal Transgressions scale (GFIT; Rasmussen &amp; Boon, 2017). The full scale measures 12 dimensions of behavioral motivation following an interpersonal transgression. For the current study, only the Power, Moral, Reputation, Protect Others, Self-Protect, Emotional Well-Being, Justice, and Education subscales will be included. Participants rate on a 1 (not at all strongly) to 7 (very strongly) scale the extent to which they held each goal in making their decision. In analyses, the Power, Reputation, Self-Protect, Avoiding Conflict, and Emotional Well-Being dimensions will be assessed as self-focused goals, and the Moral, Protect Others, Justice, Education, and Forgiveness subscales will be assessed as other-focused goals.\n\nPost-Decision Affect. Participants will be asked to report their state affect once more using the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire in order to assess whether helping or punishment decisions positively influenced participants\u2019 mood.\n\nManipulation Check. Participants will respond to three manipulation check questions to determine that the two anger conditions are perceived to be equally unfair, and that the high-cost payment tokens (SONA credits) are perceived to be more important than the low-cost payment tokens (raffle ticket entries).\n1) How fair did you think the photo rating task allocation was? (1 = completely unfair, 7 = completely fair)\n2) How important was it to you that you got the maximum number of SONA credits [raffle entries] as you could? (1 = not at all important, 7 = extremely important).\n3) Have you ever completed a task similar to the photo rating task in other studies or as part of a class?\n\nTrait Measures. Finally, participants will complete a questionnaire including a number of trait measures. These measures will be assessed after the primary measures of interest so as to not prime participants with concepts of anger or empathy.\n\nTrait Empathic Anger. Trait empathic anger is the extent to which participants tend to feel empathic anger in their daily lives, and will be measured using the Trait Empathic Anger Scale (TEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003), a seven-item Likert-scale ranging from 1 (Does Not Describe Me Very Well) to 5 (Describes Me Very Well); e.g. \u201cI feel angry for other people when they have been victimized by others.\u201d\n\nTrait Anger and Aggression.

Only a few studies have directly compared these two states within a single experiment (David et al., 2017; FeldmanHall et al., 2015; Gummerum et al., 2016; Omara et al., 2011), but none of these offered self-compensation and escape together as behavioral options in response to unfairness. Additionally, no studies of empathic anger have directly measured self-focused and other-focused goals as mediators of anger effects on behavioral decisions. Study 1 will also constrain participants to choose one behavioral response (either helping, punishment, self-compensation, or escape) so as to conceptually replicate findings that individuals are more likely to choose self-compensation than punishment when they are personally angered by an offender (FeldmanHall et al., 2015), but are more likely to compensate a victim or punish an offender when a third party is treated unfairly (Gummerum et al., 2016; van Prooijen, 2010).\n\nDesign and Participants:\nStudy 1 will have two conditions: Empathic Anger and Personal Anger. Based on a pilot study's finding that personal and empathic anger predict different levels of prosocial activity motivation at d = .46, we conducted a power analysis to determine the number of participants needed to detect this effect size  within a moderation analysis (which would involve measuring 2 factors and an interaction). A power analysis in G*Power indicated that 151 participants would be needed to detect an interaction effect size of d = .46 between two groups and a continuous factor with 80% power and \u03b1 = .05. Based on this power analysis, study 1 will recruit a minimum of 200 adult participants recruited through MTurk, who will be compensated $1.00 each. \n\nMeasures and Procedure:\nParticipants will complete the study through an electronic questionnaire system (Qualtrics) which will present study tasks and information. After indicating their informed consent, they will first read the instructions for the MTPP (see below for full description) and respond to a short quiz indicating they understand the instructions. Participants will enter their name, and both they and the other participants will be referred to by name (rather than \u201cthird player\u201d, etc.). Participants will then complete the following measures/tasks:\n\nBaseline Positive and Negative Affect. To control for individual differences in positive and negative affect entering the study, participants will first respond to the short form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988). Participants report how strongly they feel emotions with positive valence (e.g., \u201cAlert\u201d) and negative valence (e.g., \u201cAfraid\u201d) on a 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely) scale.\n\nModerator Variables: Participants will complete two trait variable questionnaires, including:\n \na. Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale. Participants' trait mindfulness will be measured by the MAAS (Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003). The scale is listed on a 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never) scale with questions asking about tendencies to act mindlessly (e.g., \"I could be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until some time later\").\n\nb. Five-Factor Trait Curiosity (Kashdan et al., 2018). Lastly participants will complete a trait measure of curiosity, the five-factor curiosity scale. Participants respond to questions about their curiosity habits (e.g., \"I like to learn about the habits of others\") on a 1 (Does not describe me at all) to 7 (Describes me completely) scale.\n\nAnger Condition and Modified Third-Party Punishment Task. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the Personal Anger or Empathic Anger condition and will complete the MTPP task. In the prototypical Third-Party Punishment task (Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2003), participants witness a \"dictator\" participant allocate unfair amounts of money to a \"recipient\" participant. This unfair allocation has been shown to elicit personal anger when the participant is the recipient, and empathic anger when the participant is a third-party witness to the allocation decision (Fehr &amp; Fishbacher, 2003). In the MTPP, the same type of allocation paradigm is used but task assignments, rather than money, are allocated. This modified task will allow us to examine how reactions to unfairness generalize beyond monetary decisions.\n\nIn the MTPP, participants are given a cover story that the study is researching group behavior, specifically \u201chow groups of people task delegation decisions in groups online vs. in-person.\u201d The participant will ostensibly be paired with two other partners online through a university research server. In actuality, the participant is the only player, and the two partners are computerized.\n\nParticipants will read that the first part of the study will involve the group members choosing how to delegate a set of tasks. The tasks involve rating and describing three sets of pictures which have been shown to elicit minimal affective responses (e.g., a floppy disc or lamp). There are to be two rounds of photos to describe in the study. One of the participants will be randomly assigned to choose how many photos each group member must complete (the group leader). Participants then rate and describe one example photo, and then will respond to attention check questions to indicate they understand the point of the study.\n\nThe computer player \"Alex\" is chosen to be the delegator for the photo tasks. Participants are shown the following allocations based on their experimental condition fr Round 1 (object photos).\n\n- Personal Anger: Total number of photos is 15. Participant is assigned 10 photos to describe; second group member is assigned 5 photos to describe; group leader assigns him/herself 0 photos.\n\n- Empathic Anger: Total number of photos is 30. Participant is assigned 10 photos to describe; second group member is assigned 20 photos to describe; group leader assigns him/herself 0 photos.\n\nParticipants then have the opportunity to write a public message to the other participants. Because the players are all computerized, the participant will see predetermined answers, with their own comment added to make it look like all players have posted messages to each other. On the next page, all of the players' messages are posted.\n\nNext, participants will actually complete the photo description assignment, and will rate and describe 10 photos (descriptions must be 100 characters at least). After completing this assignment, participants will either see a waiting screen making them wait for a few seconds while the other players complete the task (if in the empathic anger condition), or they will immediately move to the next part of the group study.\n\nEmpathy and State Affect. After Round 1 of the MTPP task and after seeing the allocation choice for Round 2, participants will report their empathic and personal anger, empathic concern, personal distress, and positive affect immediately before making the Round 2 reallocation decision. All emotions will be rated from 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Extremely).\n\nEmpathic Anger. The State Empathic Anger Scale (SEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003) measures anger felt on behalf of another person. including eight emotional adjectives (mad, angry, furious, resentful, irritated, enraged, aggravated, outraged).\n\nEmpathic Concern and Distress. Empathic concern and distress will be measured through Batson\u2019s Emotional Adjective Scale (BEAS; Batson, Fultz, &amp; Schoenrade, 1987), consisting of 14 emotional adjectives measuring other-oriented concern (sympathetic, warm, softhearted, moved, compassionate, tender) and self-focused personal distress (troubled, upset, worried, disturbed, grieved, alarmed, perturbed, distressed).\n\nPositive Affect. Positive affect will be measured with the Happiness and Relaxation subscales of the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire (Harmon-Jones et al., 2016).\n\nOn the next page, participants will be told the group leader will choose the next task allocation, which will be completed at the end of the study. They are told there are now 40 photos to be completed, and both the participant and the other group member have been assigned 20 of the 40 photos. The group leader (Alex) assigns themselves 0.\n\nAfter seeing the Round 2 allocation, participants report their state empathy and affect once more. Next, participants are also then told that they have been selected as the moderator for Round 2 of the study. Participants then choose whether they want to reallocate photos for themselves, the group leader, or the partner participant. Once they make this decision, they then choose how many photos to reallocate (0 - 20). Later, participants will learn that they do not in fact need to complete this final rating/description task.\n\nReallocation Decision. In Round 2, participants will have the option to reallocate photos for themselves (self-compensation), the third player (third party helping), or the group leader (punishment). They also have the option of not changing any photos (Escape).\n\nDecisional Goals. To assess participants\u2019 goals when choosing their helping/punishment/escape decision, participants will complete the Goals Following Interpersonal Transgressions scale (GFIT; Rasmussen &amp; Boon, 2017). The full scale measures 12 dimensions of behavioral motivation following an interpersonal transgression. For the current study, only the Power, Moral, Reputation, Protect Others, Self-Protect, Emotional Well-Being, Justice, and Education subscales will be included. Participants rate on a 1 (not at all strongly) to 7 (very strongly) scale the extent to which they held each goal in making their decision. In analyses, the Power, Reputation, Self-Protect, Avoiding Conflict, and Emotional Well-Being dimensions will be assessed as self-focused goals, and the Moral, Protect Others, Justice, Education, and Forgiveness subscales will be assessed as other-focused goals.\n\nPost-Decision Affect. Participants will be asked to report their state affect once more using the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire in order to assess whether helping or punishment decisions positively influenced participants\u2019 mood.\n\nTrait Measures. Finally, participants will complete a questionnaire including a number of trait measures. These measures will be assessed after the primary measures of interest so as to not prime participants with concepts of anger or empathy.\n\nTrait Empathic Anger. Trait empathic anger is the extent to which participants tend to feel empathic anger in their daily lives, and will be measured using the Trait Empathic Anger Scale (TEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003), a seven-item Likert-scale ranging from 1 (Does Not Describe Me Very Well) to 5 (Describes Me Very Well); e.g. \u201cI feel angry for other people when they have been victimized by others.\u201d\n\nTrait Anger and Aggression. The dispositional tendency to get angry across different situations will be measured with the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (Webster et al., 2015). This measure asks participants to report how they would describe themselves on a 1 (Does not describe me at all) to 5 (Describes me very well) scale, (e.g., \u201cGiven enough provocation, I may hit another person\u201d).\n\nNeed to Belong. The dispositional need to belong and feel social support will be measured by the Need to Belong Scale (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &amp; Schreindorfer, 2013). This asks participants to report on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale to what extent they generally are distressed by social exclusion or desire social connection (e.g., \u201cIf other people don't seem to accept me, I don't let it bother me\u201d).\n\nSadistic Impulses. Participants' tendencies to want to hurt others in everyday life will be measured by the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS, O\u2019Meara et al., 2011). The scale is listed on a 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) scale (e.g., \u201cHurting people would be exciting\u201d).\n\nFinal Description: Participants are finally informed that they will not be asked to complete the Round 2 rating assignment. They will then be asked to complete their demographics and a final short cooldown task before finishing the study.\n\nDemographics. Participants\u2019 gender, race, and age will be self-reported.\n\nCooldown task: Participants will be asked to complete the same emotional cooldown task described in Study 3 in order to mitigate the psychological effects of having been induced to feel anger.\n\nEnd-of-study Mood. To determine whether participants are leaving the study in a positive or neutral emotional state, they will lastly be asked to complete a short mood questionnaire. This measure will be used only to monitor participants' responses, and thus will only include only 1 item in order to minimize participant frustration given the high quantity of affective self-report questionnaires in the study. The item will ask \"Overall, how positive or negative is your mood right now?\" and will utilize a sliding scale ranging from -100 ('Extremely negative; the worst I've felt in a long time') to 100 ('Extremely positive; the best I've felt in a long time') with a midpoint of 0 ('Completely neutral; neither positive or negative').\n\nAfterward, participants will be fully debriefed with a written letter explaining the purpose of the study and the deception elements.\n\n\n\n*STUDY 2*\nStudy 2 will again compare the effects of personal and empathic anger on motivation to help, punish, or self-compensate while additionally assessing the effect of high or low personal cost through adding a \u201cpayment\u201d aspect to participant decisions. High-cost payments will consist of SONA credits whereas low-cost payments will consist of raffle ticket entries for a separate prize above and beyond SONA credit compensation. SONA credits are expected to be perceived as more valuable as participants (undergraduate students enrolled in Introduction to Psychology) must obtain a certain number of credits in order to pass their Introduction to Psychology class. If empathic anger predicts similar levels of helping, punishment, and other-focused goals in the high and low-cost conditions, this will be more direct evidence of altruism than what has been posited in past literature.\n\nStudy 2 includes the same hypotheses as Study 1 as well as a moderation hypothesis:\n\nH6. Decision cost will interact with experimental condition to predict participants' decision to self-compensate, helping, and punishment decisions, such that:\na.   Across all conditions, participants will be more likely to self-compensate in the high cost condition compared to the low cost condition.\nb.   The difference between decision outcomes in the high and low cost conditions will be stronger in the personal anger condition than the empathic anger condition. \n\nMethod\nDesign: Study 2 will have a 2 (Empathic vs. Personal Anger) x 2 (High vs. Low Cost) factorial design. Using the same d = .46 effect size as Study 1, a power analysis indicated that 211participants would be adequate to detect main and interaction effect sizes of similar magnitude with 80% power and \u03b1 = .05 using ANCOVA (controlling for time of semester and baseline affect).\n\nParticipants: Participants in Study 2 will be either undergraduate students at VCU participating for course credit (1 SONA credit) and entered to win a raffle for several gift cards.\n\nProcedure. Participants will complete the study in groups of three or more in a computer lab setting at Virginia Commonwealth University for 1 SONA credit (or will complete the study online through the MTurk website at www.mturk.com). After informed consent they will complete the following measures and tasks.\n\nBaseline Positive and Negative Affect. Participants will first complete the PANAS as a measure of baseline positive and negative affect.\n\nModerator Variables: Participants will complete the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale and the Five-Factor Trait Curiosity Scale.\n\nModified Third-Party Punishment Game. Participants will first read the instructions for the MTPP as described in Study 1, and will respond to a short quiz indicating they understand the instructions. Participants will then enter their name, and both they and the other participants will be referred to by name (rather than \u201cthird player\u201d or group leader). They will then be randomly assigned to the Personal Anger or Empathic Anger condition of the study, and will complete the MTPP as described in Study 1.\n\nOnce participants have been brought to the Round 2 reallocation task, they will be randomly assigned to the High Cost or Low Cost condition. Unlike Study 1 where participants could choose how to reallocate the photos freely, now participants must \"pay\" to reallocate photo tasks.\n\nHigh Cost Condition. In the high-cost condition, participants will have to \"pay\" for photo reallocation with SONA credit or from their MTurk compensation. They will be instructed that they can pay up to .05 SONA credits or $0.05 from their final compensation amount in order to reallocate photos in each round, with .05 credits/dollars per photo. The amount of credit they pay to reallocate will ostensibly be taken from their final credit amount. (In actuality, participants will receive their full credit amount at the end of the study).\n\nLow Cost Condition. In the low-cost condition, participants will have to pay for photo reallocation with entries to the gift card raffle. They will be told that each participant receives 20 raffle ticket entries, and they can pay between 0 and 20 entries to reallocate photos, with one raffle entry being equal to one photo reallocations. The number of raffle entries they pay will ostensibly be taken from their final compensation amount. (In actuality, participants will receive the full number of entries at the end of the study).\n\nDecisional Goals. To assess participants\u2019 goals when choosing their helping/punishment/escape decision, participants will complete the Goals Following Interpersonal Transgressions scale (GFIT; Rasmussen &amp; Boon, 2017). The full scale measures 12 dimensions of behavioral motivation following an interpersonal transgression. For the current study, only the Power, Moral, Reputation, Protect Others, Self-Protect, Emotional Well-Being, Justice, and Education subscales will be included. Participants rate on a 1 (not at all strongly) to 7 (very strongly) scale the extent to which they held each goal in making their decision. In analyses, the Power, Reputation, Self-Protect, Avoiding Conflict, and Emotional Well-Being dimensions will be assessed as self-focused goals, and the Moral, Protect Others, Justice, Education, and Forgiveness subscales will be assessed as other-focused goals.\n\nPost-Decision Affect. Participants will be asked to report their state affect once more using the Discrete Emotions Questionnaire in order to assess whether helping or punishment decisions positively influenced participants\u2019 mood.\n\nManipulation Check. Participants will respond to three manipulation check questions to determine that the two anger conditions are perceived to be equally unfair, and that the high-cost payment tokens (SONA credits) are perceived to be more important than the low-cost payment tokens (raffle ticket entries).\n1) How fair did you think the photo rating task allocation was? (1 = completely unfair, 7 = completely fair)\n2) How important was it to you that you got the maximum number of SONA credits [raffle entries] as you could? (1 = not at all important, 7 = extremely important).\n3) Have you ever completed a task similar to the photo rating task in other studies or as part of a class?\n\nTrait Measures. Finally, participants will complete a questionnaire including a number of trait measures. These measures will be assessed after the primary measures of interest so as to not prime participants with concepts of anger or empathy.\n\nTrait Empathic Anger. Trait empathic anger is the extent to which participants tend to feel empathic anger in their daily lives, and will be measured using the Trait Empathic Anger Scale (TEAS; Vitaglione &amp; Barnett, 2003), a seven-item Likert-scale ranging from 1 (Does Not Describe Me Very Well) to 5 (Describes Me Very Well); e.g. \u201cI feel angry for other people when they have been victimized by others.\u201d\n\nTrait Anger and Aggression. The dispositional tendency to get angry across different situations will be measured with the Brief Aggression Questionnaire (Webster et al., 2015). This measure asks participants to report how they would describe themselves on a 1 (Does not describe me at all) to 5 (Describes me very well) scale, (e.g., \u201cGiven enough provocation, I may hit another person\u201d).\n\nNeed to Belong. The dispositional need to belong and feel social support will be measured by the Need to Belong Scale (Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, &amp; Schreindorfer, 2013). This asks participants to report on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) scale to what extent they generally are distressed by social exclusion or desire social connection (e.g., \u201cIf other people don't seem to accept me, I don't let it bother me\u201d).\n\nSadistic Impulses. Participants' tendencies to want to hurt others in everyday life will be measured by the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale (SSIS, O\u2019Meara et al., 2011). The scale is listed on a 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) scale (e.g., \u201cHurting people would be exciting\u201d).\n\nFinal Description: Participants are finally informed that they will not be asked to complete the Round 2 rating assignment. They will then be asked to complete their demographics and a final short cooldown task before finishing the study.\n\nDemographics. Participants\u2019 gender, race, and age will be self-reported.\n\nCooldown task: Participants will be asked to complete the same emotional cooldown task described in Study 3 in order to mitigate the psychological effects of having been induced to feel anger.\n\nEnd-of-study Mood. To determine whether participants are leaving the study in a positive or neutral emotional state, they will lastly be asked to complete a short mood questionnaire. This measure will be used only to monitor participants' responses, and thus will only include only 1 item in order to minimize participant frustration given the high quantity of affective self-report questionnaires in the study. The item will ask \"Overall, how positive or negative is your mood right now?\" and will utilize a sliding scale ranging from -100 ('Extremely negative; the worst I've felt in a long time') to 100 ('Extremely positive; the best I've felt in a long time') with a midpoint of 0 ('Completely neutral; neither positive or negative').\n\nDebriefing: Participants will be debriefed about the true purpose of the study, and will be told that they will receive the full compensation amount regardless of how many photos they reallocated in the study.", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Variables: \n\n1.

The study will comprise two parts to be completed in succession. In Part 1, participants will complete two-factor, Triarchic (three-factor), and four-factor measures of psychopathy. \nIn Part 2, we will employ a vignette-based approach to assess empathic responding (for this approach in a similar context of assessing perceived target emotional responses, see Tiedens, Ellsworth, &amp; Mesquita, 2000). For generality, we composed four vignettes (see below), each depicting an empathy-evoking story detailing an unfortunate situation that befalls a target with a gender-neutral designation. Scenario endings were modified, based on an appraisal-based framework (Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985), to evoke \u201cempathic distress\u201d vs. \u201cempathic anger.\u201d For empathic-distress scenarios, we manipulated the story\u2019s resolution so that the unfortunate situation would be perceived to be beyond anyone\u2019s control (e.g., \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because of poor economic conditions that have disproportionately affected people with Sam\u2019s specialized skills.\u201d). This situation should stimulate an affect responsivity system that, according to Blair (2003), is sensitive to distress (e.g., fear and sadness) expressions. For empathic-anger scenarios, we manipulated the story\u2019s resolution the unfortunate situation was not beyond anyone\u2019s control and someone other than the target was responsible for causing it (e.g., \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is not because of bad economic conditions but, instead, because Sam\u2019s boss was envious of Sam and wanted to sabotage Sam\u2019s career.\u201d). This situation should stimulate an affect responsivity system that, according to Blair (2003), is sensitive to stimuli indicative of violating social norms or expectations.\n\tParticipants will read each vignette with each story ending. After each ending, participants will rate appraisals of relative other-agency and relative situational control as manipulation checks for the empathy scenario manipulation. Participants will also rate a) the extent to which they perceive the target would feel angry, sad, and afraid (i.e., perceived target emotional responses) and b) the extent to which they feel angry, sad, and afraid for the target (i.e., vicarious emotional responses). We will compute variables that index the relative difference between the latter and former (i.e., vicarious emotional sensitivity) and the absolute difference between the latter and former (i.e., emotional congruence). Finally, participants will be debriefed after completing demographics (age, race, gender).\nMeasures\nLevenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP; Levenson et al., 1995). The LSRP is a 26-item two-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into primary psychopathy (e.g., \u201cI enjoy manipulating other people's feelings.\u201d) and secondary psychopathy (e.g., \u201cI find myself in the same kinds of trouble, time after time.\u201d). Factor-analytic evidence has supported this two-factor structure (e.g., Salekin, Chen, Sellbom, Lester, &amp; MacDougall, 2014). Participants will rate (dis)agreement with each statement (1 = disagree strongly, 4 = agree strongly).\nTriarchic Personality Measure (TriPM; Patrick et al., 2009). The TriPM is a 58-item three-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into Triarchic dimensions of boldness (e.g., \u201cI can get over things that would traumatize others.\u201d), disinhibition (e.g., \u201cI often act on immediate needs.\u201d), and meanness (e.g., \u201cI don't care much if what I do hurts others.\u201d). Participants will rate the extent to which each statement describes them (1 = true, 4 = false). \nSelf-Report Psychology Scale IV \u2013 Short Form (SRP-SF; Paulhus et al., 2016). The SRP-SF is a 29-item four-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into psychopathic features of interpersonal manipulation (e.g., \u201cA lot of people are \u2018suckers\u2019 and can easily be fooled.\u201d), callous affect (e.g., \u201cI never feel guilty over hurting others.\u201d), erratic lifestyle (e.g., \u201cI rarely follow the rules.\u201d), and antisocial behavior (e.g., \u201cI have assaulted a law enforcement official or social worker.\u201d). The SRP-SF is an abbreviated version of the full 64-item SRP and is conceptually analogous to the four factors postulated by Hare\u2019s Psychopathy Checklist \u2013 Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 2003). Participants will rate (dis)agreement with each statement (1 = disagree strongly, 5 = agree strongly).\nRelative other-agency appraisals. For one of our manipulation checks, we adapted items from Smith and Ellsworth (1985) to assess, by condition, the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) participants believed that (1) someone other than the target was responsible for the target having [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (other-agency) and (2) the target was responsible for having [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (self-agency). Items will be averaged across vignettes to create aggregate indices. We will compute a discrepancy score by subtracting self-agency from other-agency, thereby creating an index of relative other-agency appraisals. Positive scores denote appraisals of higher other-agency compared to self-agency. \nRelative situational control appraisals. For our other manipulation check, we adapted items from Smith and Ellsworth (1985) to assess, by condition, the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) participants believed that (1) circumstances beyond anyone\u2019s control were controlling whether the target [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (situational control) and (2) the target had the ability to influence whether s/he [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (self-control). Items will be averaged across vignettes. We will compute a discrepancy score by subtracting self-control from situational control, thereby creating an index of relative situational control appraisals. Positive scores denote appraisals of higher situational control compared to self-control.   \n\tPerceived target emotional responses. Participants will rate the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) the target would feel the following \u201cemotion concepts\u201d: anger (treated unfairly, angry, boiling inwardly), sadness (a sense of loss, sad, helpless), and fear (uncertain, afraid, a desire to avoid). Inspired by the framework proposed in Frijda (1986), each emotion concept encompasses an item representing the cognitive-structural component, the feeling component, and the action tendency, respectively. According to Frijda, Kuipers, and ter Schure (1989), an emotional state may be incomplete without considering all three components. Items will be averaged across vignettes.\n\tVicarious emotional responses. Participants will rate the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) they feel the following \u201cemotion concepts\u201d for the target: anger (treated unfairly, angry, boiling inwardly), sadness (a sense of loss, sad, helpless), and fear (uncertain, afraid, a desire to avoid). Items will be averaged across vignettes.\n\tVicarious emotional sensitivity. We will compute \u201crelative discrepancy scores\u201d by subtracting perceived target emotional responses from respective vicarious emotional responses, thereby creating indices of vicarious emotional sensitivity for each emotion. Positive scores represent vicarious emotional sensitivity (i.e., the vicarious response overwhelms the target appraisal), whereas negative scores represent vicarious emotional insensitivity (i.e., the target appraisal overwhelms the vicarious response).\n\tEmotional congruence. We will compute \u201cabsolute discrepancy scores\u201d by taking the absolute value of each index of vicarious emotional sensitivity and multiplying the result by -1 (for a similar approach to computing empathy, Kraus, C\u00f4t\u00e9, &amp; Keltner, 2010). Thus, higher scores denote greater emotional congruence and, hence, approaches greater \u201cempathy.\u201d\n\n\nEmpathy Vignettes\nVignette 1\n\"Sam has worked for the same company for the past 10 years. Sam is known as a hard-working and talented employee at the company. Sam loves his/her job and has demonstrated a selfless commitment to helping the company grow and thrive. Unfortunately, Sam just learned that s/he will be laid off at the end of the month. Sam\u2019s unemployment will likely have a devastating impact on Sam and Sam\u2019s family, such that they will struggle to pay bills and have enough food to eat.\"\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because of poor economic conditions that have disproportionately affected people with Sam\u2019s specialized skills.\u201d \n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because Sam\u2019s boss was envious of Sam and wanted to sabotage Sam\u2019s career\u201d\n\n\nVignette 2\n \u201cTaylor is a talented and hard-working track athlete. Taylor has been training all of his/her life to be an Olympic track athlete. Due to hard work and dedication, Taylor has been named as the next rising star to run in the Olympics. Unfortunately, Taylor tripped and fell during the Olympic qualifiers, finishing in last place. Taylor did not qualify for the Olympics and must wait four more years to attempt another Olympic qualifier. Taylor will lose all of his/her endorsements, which is most of Taylor\u2019s annual income.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cTaylor soon finds out that the reason s/he tripped and fell was because it rained the night before, making the track extremely slick in Taylor\u2019s inside lane which was collecting water.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cTaylor soon finds out that the reason s/he tripped and fell was because a rival had poured a slippery liquid in Taylor\u2019s lane before the race in order to take Taylor\u2019s spot on the qualifying team.\u201d\n\n\n\nVignette 3\n\u201cMorgan owns a thriving steakhouse. Morgan is completely dedicated to his/her restaurant, putting in long hours and a considerable amount of money into keeping the restaurant running. Morgan\u2019s reputation has attracted attention from elite restaurant reviewers who have decided to review Morgan\u2019s restaurant. This is an incredible opportunity for Morgan. Unfortunately, Morgan\u2019s staff served steak that made all of the customers \u2013 including the reviewers \u2013 violently ill. The incident became public, and the Department of Public Health was forced to shut down Morgan\u2019s restaurant due to health violations. Morgan lost his/her cherished restaurant.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cMorgan soon finds out that the reason customers got sick was because of a local, unpreventable salmonella outbreak in one of their recent beef shipments.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cMorgan soon finds out that the reason customers got sick was because a rival restaurateur tainted Morgan\u2019s beef supply.\u201d\n\n\nVignette 4\n \u201cJamie is a hard-working professional. Jamie\u2019s dream has been to move his family into a beautiful, Victorian-style house in the neighborhood. Over the past 10 years, Jamie has been working overtime and multiple, part-time jobs. Finally, Jamie was able to save enough money to finally move his/her family into the new house. Unfortunately, the house caught fire one night and burned to the ground, just weeks after Jamie and his/her family moved in. Although nobody was injured, all of the family\u2019s possessions were destroyed in the fire, including treasured and irreplaceable family heirlooms. Jamie\u2019s insurance policy application had not yet been processed, so insurance will not cover Jamie for the losses.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cJamie soon finds out that the reason Jamie\u2019s house burned down was because of a freak, unavoidable gas leak that ignited the fire.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cJamie soon finds out that the reason Jamie\u2019s house burned down was because of a neighborhood delinquent who set fire to the home as a cruel prank.\u201d\n\n"}}}, "planned-sample": {"value": {"question4b": {"extra": [], "value": "In an effort to increase the generalizability of our sample, we will recruit additional male participants so that the maximum female-to-male ratio is 3:2 (vs. 4:1 or greater, for example).

For Hypothesis #1, psychopathy dimensions indicative of fearless dominance or callousness (i.e., primary psychopathy, boldness, meanness, affective features, and interpersonal features) will be the only dimensions to be inversely related (weakly-to-moderately) to perceived target emotion vis-\u00e0-vis sadness and fear but positively related (extremely weakly and approaching zero) to perceived target emotion vis-\u00e0-vis anger. For Hypothesis #2, these dimensions will be inversely related (weakly-to-moderately) to vicarious emotion vis-\u00e0-vis sadness and fear but positively related (extremely weakly and/or approaching zero) to vicarious emotion vis-\u00e0-vis anger. Hypotheses for potential, but extremely weak, relations between certain psychopathy dimensions and anger outcomes were motivated by theorizing and research indicating that psychopathy dimensions are associated with experiencing other-directed negative states (e.g., contempt, spite) which function to promote antagonism (Garofalo, Neumann, Zeigler-Hill, &amp; Meloy, 2018). Because anger is part of this same classification, positive relations between psychopathy dimensions and anger outcomes would be sensible, even if their strength also depends on situational context. For Hypothesis #3, all psychopathy dimensions will be inversely related (extremely weakly and/or approaching zero) to vicarious sensitivity across emotion concepts. Likewise, for Hypothesis #4, all psychopathy dimensions will be extremely weakly related and approaching zero relations to emotional congruence, meaning that no strong evidence is anticipated for empathy to vary across psychopathy scores. \n\nWe will run three sets of exploratory analyses. First, we will explore confirmatory analyses (i.e., Hypotheses 1-4) controlling for gender. Although psychopathy is subject to gender differences (i.e., men score higher, on average, on psychopathy dimensions than women; Miller, Watts, &amp; Jones, 2011), we are devoid of a strong theoretical rationale to assume that our current conceptualization of empathy is similarly subject to gender differences. Thus, these analyses are most sensibly considered exploratory. Second, we will experimentally test a DMH explanation for Hypotheses 1 and 2. These exploratory hypotheses predict that the hypothesized relations vis-\u00e0-vis perceived target emotion and vicarious emotion will be moderated by whether the scenarios conceptually evoke empathic distress vs. empathic anger. In particular, relations between hypothesized psychopathy dimensions and empathy components of sadness and fear might be (weakly) attenuated for empathic-distress scenarios relative to empathic anger scenarios. This moderation would support the DMH because it suggests psychopathic people have a lower propensity for appraising unfortunate situations as being beyond someone\u2019s control which is theorized to engender sadness and fear. In the context of these analyses, we will also explore interactions between psychopathy dimensions and empathy scenarios on empathy components of anger. Third, we will explore whether relations testing Hypotheses 1 and 2 can be independently explained by appraisals of situational contexts (e.g., the degree to which the unfortunate outcome was situationally-determined vs. self-determined). Indeed, under an appraisal-based theory, people higher in psychopathy dimensions indicative of fearless dominance or callousness might perceive lesser sadness or fear in targets and feel lesser sadness or fear for targets because they perceive the target (relative to the situation) as having greater control over the target\u2019s outcome.

The study will comprise two parts to be completed in succession. In Part 1, participants will complete two-factor, Triarchic (three-factor), and four-factor measures of psychopathy. \nIn Part 2, we will employ a vignette-based approach to assess empathic responding (for this approach in a similar context of assessing perceived target emotional responses, see Tiedens, Ellsworth, &amp; Mesquita, 2000). For generality, we composed four vignettes (see below), each depicting an empathy-evoking story detailing an unfortunate situation that befalls a target with a gender-neutral designation. Scenario endings were modified, based on an appraisal-based framework (Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985), to evoke \u201cempathic distress\u201d vs. \u201cempathic anger.\u201d For empathic-distress scenarios, we manipulated the story\u2019s resolution so that the unfortunate situation would be perceived to be beyond anyone\u2019s control (e.g., \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because of poor economic conditions that have disproportionately affected people with Sam\u2019s specialized skills.\u201d). This situation should stimulate an affect responsivity system that, according to Blair (2003), is sensitive to distress (e.g., fear and sadness) expressions. For empathic-anger scenarios, we manipulated the story\u2019s resolution the unfortunate situation was not beyond anyone\u2019s control and someone other than the target was responsible for causing it (e.g., \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is not because of bad economic conditions but, instead, because Sam\u2019s boss was envious of Sam and wanted to sabotage Sam\u2019s career.\u201d). This situation should stimulate an affect responsivity system that, according to Blair (2003), is sensitive to stimuli indicative of violating social norms or expectations.\n\tParticipants will read each vignette with each story ending. After each ending, participants will rate appraisals of relative other-agency and relative situational control as manipulation checks for the empathy scenario manipulation. Participants will also rate a) the extent to which they perceive the target would feel angry, sad, and afraid (i.e., perceived target emotional responses) and b) the extent to which they feel angry, sad, and afraid for the target (i.e., vicarious emotional responses). We will compute variables that index the relative difference between the latter and former (i.e., vicarious emotional sensitivity) and the absolute difference between the latter and former (i.e., emotional congruence). Finally, participants will be debriefed after completing demographics (age, race, gender).\nMeasures\nLevenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP; Levenson et al., 1995). The LSRP is a 26-item two-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into primary psychopathy (e.g., \u201cI enjoy manipulating other people's feelings.\u201d) and secondary psychopathy (e.g., \u201cI find myself in the same kinds of trouble, time after time.\u201d). Factor-analytic evidence has supported this two-factor structure (e.g., Salekin, Chen, Sellbom, Lester, &amp; MacDougall, 2014). Participants will rate (dis)agreement with each statement (1 = disagree strongly, 4 = agree strongly).\nTriarchic Personality Measure (TriPM; Patrick et al., 2009). The TriPM is a 58-item three-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into Triarchic dimensions of boldness (e.g., \u201cI can get over things that would traumatize others.\u201d), disinhibition (e.g., \u201cI often act on immediate needs.\u201d), and meanness (e.g., \u201cI don't care much if what I do hurts others.\u201d). Participants will rate the extent to which each statement describes them (1 = true, 4 = false). \nSelf-Report Psychology Scale IV \u2013 Short Form (SRP-SF; Paulhus et al., 2016). The SRP-SF is a 29-item four-factor measure of psychopathy which summates items into psychopathic features of interpersonal manipulation (e.g., \u201cA lot of people are \u2018suckers\u2019 and can easily be fooled.\u201d), callous affect (e.g., \u201cI never feel guilty over hurting others.\u201d), erratic lifestyle (e.g., \u201cI rarely follow the rules.\u201d), and antisocial behavior (e.g., \u201cI have assaulted a law enforcement official or social worker.\u201d). The SRP-SF is an abbreviated version of the full 64-item SRP and is conceptually analogous to the four factors postulated by Hare\u2019s Psychopathy Checklist \u2013 Revised (PCL-R; Hare, 2003). Participants will rate (dis)agreement with each statement (1 = disagree strongly, 5 = agree strongly).\nRelative other-agency appraisals. For one of our manipulation checks, we adapted items from Smith and Ellsworth (1985) to assess, by condition, the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) participants believed that (1) someone other than the target was responsible for the target having [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (other-agency) and (2) the target was responsible for having [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (self-agency). Items will be averaged across vignettes to create aggregate indices. We will compute a discrepancy score by subtracting self-agency from other-agency, thereby creating an index of relative other-agency appraisals. Positive scores denote appraisals of higher other-agency compared to self-agency. \nRelative situational control appraisals. For our other manipulation check, we adapted items from Smith and Ellsworth (1985) to assess, by condition, the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) participants believed that (1) circumstances beyond anyone\u2019s control were controlling whether the target [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (situational control) and (2) the target had the ability to influence whether s/he [endured the unfortunate outcome] in this situation (self-control). Items will be averaged across vignettes. We will compute a discrepancy score by subtracting self-control from situational control, thereby creating an index of relative situational control appraisals. Positive scores denote appraisals of higher situational control compared to self-control.   \n\tPerceived target emotional responses. Participants will rate the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) the target would feel the following \u201cemotion concepts\u201d: anger (treated unfairly, angry, boiling inwardly), sadness (a sense of loss, sad, helpless), and fear (uncertain, afraid, a desire to avoid). Inspired by the framework proposed in Frijda (1986), each emotion concept encompasses an item representing the cognitive-structural component, the feeling component, and the action tendency, respectively. According to Frijda, Kuipers, and ter Schure (1989), an emotional state may be incomplete without considering all three components. Items will be averaged across vignettes.\n\tVicarious emotional responses. Participants will rate the extent to which (1 = not at all, 7 = extremely) they feel the following \u201cemotion concepts\u201d for the target: anger (treated unfairly, angry, boiling inwardly), sadness (a sense of loss, sad, helpless), and fear (uncertain, afraid, a desire to avoid). Items will be averaged across vignettes.\n\tVicarious emotional sensitivity. We will compute \u201crelative discrepancy scores\u201d by subtracting perceived target emotional responses from respective vicarious emotional responses, thereby creating indices of vicarious emotional sensitivity for each emotion. Positive scores represent vicarious emotional sensitivity (i.e., the vicarious response overwhelms the target appraisal), whereas negative scores represent vicarious emotional insensitivity (i.e., the target appraisal overwhelms the vicarious response).\n\tEmotional congruence. We will compute \u201cabsolute discrepancy scores\u201d by taking the absolute value of each index of vicarious emotional sensitivity and multiplying the result by -1 (for a similar approach to computing empathy, Kraus, C\u00f4t\u00e9, &amp; Keltner, 2010). Thus, higher scores denote greater emotional congruence and, hence, approaches greater \u201cempathy.\u201d\n\n\nEmpathy Vignettes\nVignette 1\n\"Sam has worked for the same company for the past 10 years. Sam is known as a hard-working and talented employee at the company. Sam loves his/her job and has demonstrated a selfless commitment to helping the company grow and thrive. Unfortunately, Sam just learned that s/he will be laid off at the end of the month. Sam\u2019s unemployment will likely have a devastating impact on Sam and Sam\u2019s family, such that they will struggle to pay bills and have enough food to eat.\"\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because of poor economic conditions that have disproportionately affected people with Sam\u2019s specialized skills.\u201d \n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cSam soon finds out that the reason s/he is being fired is because Sam\u2019s boss was envious of Sam and wanted to sabotage Sam\u2019s career\u201d\n\n\nVignette 2\n \u201cTaylor is a talented and hard-working track athlete. Taylor has been training all of his/her life to be an Olympic track athlete. Due to hard work and dedication, Taylor has been named as the next rising star to run in the Olympics. Unfortunately, Taylor tripped and fell during the Olympic qualifiers, finishing in last place. Taylor did not qualify for the Olympics and must wait four more years to attempt another Olympic qualifier. Taylor will lose all of his/her endorsements, which is most of Taylor\u2019s annual income.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cTaylor soon finds out that the reason s/he tripped and fell was because it rained the night before, making the track extremely slick in Taylor\u2019s inside lane which was collecting water.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cTaylor soon finds out that the reason s/he tripped and fell was because a rival had poured a slippery liquid in Taylor\u2019s lane before the race in order to take Taylor\u2019s spot on the qualifying team.\u201d\n\n\n\nVignette 3\n\u201cMorgan owns a thriving steakhouse. Morgan is completely dedicated to his/her restaurant, putting in long hours and a considerable amount of money into keeping the restaurant running. Morgan\u2019s reputation has attracted attention from elite restaurant reviewers who have decided to review Morgan\u2019s restaurant. This is an incredible opportunity for Morgan. Unfortunately, Morgan\u2019s staff served steak that made all of the customers \u2013 including the reviewers \u2013 violently ill. The incident became public, and the Department of Public Health was forced to shut down Morgan\u2019s restaurant due to health violations. Morgan lost his/her cherished restaurant.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cMorgan soon finds out that the reason customers got sick was because of a local, unpreventable salmonella outbreak in one of their recent beef shipments.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cMorgan soon finds out that the reason customers got sick was because a rival restaurateur tainted Morgan\u2019s beef supply.\u201d\n\n\nVignette 4\n \u201cJamie is a hard-working professional. Jamie\u2019s dream has been to move his family into a beautiful, Victorian-style house in the neighborhood. Over the past 10 years, Jamie has been working overtime and multiple, part-time jobs. Finally, Jamie was able to save enough money to finally move his/her family into the new house. Unfortunately, the house caught fire one night and burned to the ground, just weeks after Jamie and his/her family moved in. Although nobody was injured, all of the family\u2019s possessions were destroyed in the fire, including treasured and irreplaceable family heirlooms. Jamie\u2019s insurance policy application had not yet been processed, so insurance will not cover Jamie for the losses.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Distress Scenario Ending: \u201cJamie soon finds out that the reason Jamie\u2019s house burned down was because of a freak, unavoidable gas leak that ignited the fire.\u201d\n\nEmpathic-Anger Scenario Ending: \u201cJamie soon finds out that the reason Jamie\u2019s house burned down was because of a neighborhood delinquent who set fire to the home as a cruel prank.\u201d\n\n", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question1c": "Psychopathy dimensions (summated): primary psychopathy, secondary psychopathy, boldness, meanness, disinhibition, interpersonal manipulation, callous affect, erratic lifestyle, antisocial behavior.\nPerceived target anger, sadness, and fear (averaged across three respective components and further averaged across vignettes).", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question2c": "zero-order correlation analysis", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question3c": "Psychopathy dimensions (conceptualized as IV); perceived target emotional responses (conceptualized as DV)", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question4c": "N/A", "confirmatory-analyses-first.first.question5c": "In accordance with guidelines proposed in Amrhein, Trafimow, and Greenland (2019), we plan to address the limitation of statistical significance dichotomization by focusing discussion of our data on parameter estimates (i.e., effect sizes based on recommendations in Funder and Ozer, 2019).
