response. Research guided by the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) framework has shown that when individuals respond to a task with a threat appraisal, their performance in physical tasks is reduced compared to individuals who respond with a challenge appraisal. The majority of the physical tasks were comprised of spatial, cognitive, tactical, and motor skills, while only one study under the BPSM framework assessed endurance exercise. Importantly, these studies only examine threat and challenge using a measure of cardiovascular reactivity to a task-related prompt. Research in mental fatigue supports the hypothesis that endurance exercise may be affected by task-unrelated psychological processes, similar to those which initiate physiological threat or challenge responses. To date, there is no evidence that assesses how the physiological stress response, both in terms of cardiovascular reactivity and HPA axis activation, following a task-unrelated psychological stressor affects endurance exercise performance. \nTherefore, the primary objective of the proposed experimental study is to investigate whether an acute psychological stressor impedes physical performance, measured by power output, during a subsequent endurance exercise task, an 8KM time trial, in a healthy but untrained sample of females during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The secondary objective of the proposed experiment is to complete a comprehensive examination of psychological (i.e., perceptions of exertion, mood, arousal) and physiological (i.e., oxygen consumption, heart rate, and cortisol response to the time trial) differences during and after the 8KM time trial in response to the acute psychological stressor and placebo stressor, respectively."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that exposure to a laboratory-induced psychological stressor will reduce performance in the time trial, operationalized as a decrease in average power output and power output trajectories, compared to a time trial performed following a placebo task.\nThe secondary hypothesis of the proposed study is that participants will report elevated perceptions of exertions, both average values and trajectories, during the time trial that immediately follows the TSST, compared to the time trial which follows the P-TSST.\nI hypothesize that participants\u2019 average oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption trajectory will be lower during the time trial following the TSST, relative to the time trial immediately following the P-TSST.

Research guided by the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) framework has shown that when individuals respond to a task with a threat appraisal, their performance in physical tasks is reduced compared to individuals who respond with a challenge appraisal. The majority of the physical tasks were comprised of spatial, cognitive, tactical, and motor skills, while only one study under the BPSM framework assessed endurance exercise. Importantly, these studies only examine threat and challenge using a measure of cardiovascular reactivity to a task-related prompt. Research in mental fatigue supports the hypothesis that endurance exercise may be affected by task-unrelated psychological processes, similar to those which initiate physiological threat or challenge responses. To date, there is no evidence that assesses how the physiological stress response, both in terms of cardiovascular reactivity and HPA axis activation, following a task-unrelated psychological stressor affects endurance exercise performance. \nTherefore, the primary objective of the proposed experimental study is to investigate whether an acute psychological stressor impedes physical performance, measured by power output, during a subsequent endurance exercise task, an 8KM time trial, in a healthy but untrained sample of females during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The secondary objective of the proposed experiment is to complete a comprehensive examination of psychological (i.e., perceptions of exertion, mood, arousal) and physiological (i.e., oxygen consumption, heart rate, and cortisol response to the time trial) differences during and after the 8KM time trial in response to the acute psychological stressor and placebo stressor, respectively.", "q4": "The primary hypothesis of the proposed study is that exposure to a laboratory-induced psychological stressor will reduce performance in the time trial, operationalized as a decrease in average power output and power output trajectories, compared to a time trial performed following a placebo task.\nThe secondary hypothesis of the proposed study is that participants will report elevated perceptions of exertions, both average values and trajectories, during the time trial that immediately follows the TSST, compared to the time trial which follows the P-TSST.\nI hypothesize that participants\u2019 average oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption trajectory will be lower during the time trial following the TSST, relative to the time trial immediately following the P-TSST. The proposed study will also test the secondary hypothesis that exposure to the TSST will result in an attenuated cortisol response to the time trial, compared to exposure to the P-TSST.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.", "q6": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.", "Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as \u201cdouble blind\u201d)", "Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group."], "q7": "", "q9": "The proposed study will use block randomization, with a block size of 2. Participants will be assigned to one of the two equally sized blocks that represent the two levels of the independent variable. A study coordinator that is not involved in testing will oversee randomization.", "q10": "Registration prior to creation of data", "q11": "", "q13": "90 participants will be randomized in the proposed study. Participants must attend both days of the study to be randomized.", "q14": "Based on an a priori power analysis for an ANOVA calculated using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007), the sample for the proposed study is required to be at least 90 participants to detect a medium effect size (0.3) at an \u03b1 level of 0.05 with a test power of .80.", "q15": "", "q20": "Before data is analysed, we will test dependent variables for skewness, kurtosis. If data is not normally distributed, then we will apply a log transformation (for zero values, a value of .0001 will be substituted so log transformation doesn\u2019t result in an infinite value). Randomized groups will be dummy coded with two letters (X and Y) to blind the person performing analysis to the group. Model diagnostics will be performed based on fitted values and residuals.\nFor exploratory analysis, cortisol reactivity to the stressor will be dummy coded based on a median split, with a value of 1 being assigned to participants who respond greater than or equal to the median, and a value of 0 being assigned to participants who respond less than the median.", "q21": "The proposed study will use an alpha level of .05 to determine whether findings are significant. \nFor exploratory analyses, an alpha level of .1 will be used to determine whether findings warrant further examination.", "q22": "Failure to complete or comply with the procedures for the Trier Social Stress Test or the Time Trial will result in complete omission of the participant's data.\nOutliers will be included, unless entry error is obvious (data with a magnitude over 10 times the mean)", "q23": "If data is missing either at random or complete at random, then multiple imputation will be used. To perform multiple imputation, the missRanger function from the r package missRanger will be used. To allow for reproducibility, the default function parameters as well as set.seed will be used.", "q24": "Using the same statistical models as described above, exploratory analyses will include investigating the effects of stressor condition (experimental group) on heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen consumption, mood, and arousal during the time trial (average, peak, and trajectories). \nExploratory analyses will also include investigating the effect of the TSST on pre-post comparisons of negative affect and task appraisal, and post-TSST measures of rumination.\nAs a greater cortisol response would be indicative of a successful threat manipulation during the acute laboratory stressor as well as a proxy of the challenge-threat index, the proposed study will also explore whether individuals\u2019 cortisol reactivity to the stressor predicts the above performance differences (i.e., power output) and responses to exercise (i.e., perceptions of exertion, cortisol response) during the time trial.\n", "q25": "References:\nAllen, A.

The study is only seeking out United States citizens and will take approximately 5-6 minutes to complete.\n\nIn the pre-test phase, subjects will begin by reading provided IRB consent and disclosure forms and then clicking that they consent to be part of to the experiment. This disclosure section will make clear the need for subjects to take this survey on a device with audio player capability, and directly following the consent section, participants will be given an audio test to complete. In the attached audio there will be a stated four-digit number. Only with entry of that number (serving as an audio check), and with confirmation that they are a US citizen, will a participant be able to move forward. \n\nThe final pre-test question asks participants about their views on government spending, and the aim of this question is to calculate people\u2019s political leaning and already established attitude on government spending. Because the treatment in this experiment will involve a news story about a bill that seeks to spend public funds to fund school meals for America\u2019s youth, it is important to measure where people stand on government spending prior to exposure to this treatment. That measured attitude will then be used to sort people into a more conservative leaning or liberal leaning pool, though their subsequent assignment to one of the four treatments will remain random.\n\nAfter being sorted based on their measured political leanings, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (humor frames, punditry frames, hard news frames, and no audio treatment). Subjects in the first three treatment groups will be exposed to a 90 second audio clip about The Universal School Meals Program Act, a bill awaiting votes in the house and the senate that wants to provide free school meals to all children in American public schools. Treatment 1 involves a podcast clip revolving around this bill that is told with prevalent humor frames. Two different audio files have been created (one liberal leaning and one conservative) and while subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment, they will be placed in either liberal or conservative groups based on their pre-stated views on government spending. Similarly, treatment 2 is composed of a podcast clip about this bill that is told with punditry and opinion frames. It also has two different audio files, one for liberal listeners, and one for conservative. Treatment 3, composed of hard news framing of this proposed policy, has only one audio clip, and finally treatment 4 consists of no audio clip. In treatment 4, participants will move directly from the pre-test to the post-test. \n\nDirectly following whatever condition a participant was assigned to, study subjects will grade two questions on a seven point scale: Was the story clear? And, do you think the podcast contained false or misleading information? Following this, three knowledge questions that directly relate to the story will be asked. The intention in asking these stories is twofold: first, to see if participants were actively listening to the story, and second, to see if they learned anything from the story that members in the control group did not. They will then be asked questions about the importance of this school meals issue to the country, and whether they support the Universal School Meals Program Act having heard this podcast story clip. \n\nAfter giving their assessment on the story and the proposed policy, participants will be asked about their experiences with podcasts and political podcasts, how often they consume news media, and what American political parties they are likely to vote for. Through asking questions about their media consumption habits, how often they encounter podcasts, and what political parties they may be sympathetic towards, the hope is to have a more flushed out picture of what these participants bring bias-wise to the study. At this time, other important demographics like gender, race, age, and so on will be collected, using phrasing and flow mirroring Pew Research Center surveys, and a final comment section will be made available before the close of the survey. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "O'Connell Preregistration.pdf"}, "nodeId": "uzgs8", "sha256": "d914b015d3e6a5a57efbe859600c2ba407fefa37017a11c53d8cf1ff924128d1", "viewUrl": "/project/tcnuk/files/osfstorage/5e5d38eb86b40d0024d045d5/", "selectedFileName": "O'Connell Preregistration.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q9": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q10": {"extra": [], "value": "Registration prior to creation of data"}, "q11": {"extra": [], "value": "not using existing data"}, "q12": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Using MTurk to recruit 1500+ participants in my survey experiment.

The humor frames have been recreated in a liberal condition and a conservative one, and while the jokes are different, the relative level of humor is the same, with a comparable number of jokes and as much flow and tone mirroring as possible. \n\nOpinion Frames.

There will be a baseline of facts that is shared between all three of the audio treatment groups, but those facts are supplemented with opinion and punditry provided by the speakers in the audio clip. This opinion is an entertainment and persuasion tactic that is more exaggerated than opinion-based statements are in hard news storytelling. The punditry frames have been recreated in a liberal condition and a conservative one, and while the opinions are different, the relative amount of time dedicated to opinions, and much of the flow and tone are as closely identical as possible.\n\nHard News Frames. In treatment three, participants will be exposed to a 90 second podcast story that is based off of a typical hard news style. The baseline facts shared in all of the audio treatments will be available in this podcast clip as well, but those facts are elaborated and more detail is provided. The goal in this treatment was to limit bias in storytelling, and as such both liberal and conservative opinion have been mentioned and presented, but the podcast clip itself is meant to inform and not to persuade.

Through assessing both between group variance and within group variance, the hope is to ascertain whether my independent variables have had any substantial effect on participants (MIT, \u201cLaboratory in Visual Cognition,\u201d 2008). This experiment has four potential treatment groups (humor frames, opinion frames, hard news frames, and no treatment), but has purposefully been kept limited and controlled in its design and scope. As such, ANOVA models can be used to compare the mean values collected during the experiment.  The purpose of assessing these means is to see what differences and discrepancies may have been measured as a result of the manipulated variables (Shikano, Br\u00e4uninger and Stoffel, 2012). \n\nAs has been outlined previously in this preregistration document, two of my treatment groups (humor frames and opinion frames) actually consist of two levels, one liberal and one conservative. This project has been designed in this way for a number of reasons. First, there are a number of sub-research questions I am asking about any potential differences between the framing effects of conservative podcasts and liberal ones. Second, in order to study the phenomena of political podcasts in a way that mirrors todays polarized, high-choice environment, two different treatment levels were needed. This being the case, I will of course test first between these two levels within each group, seeing if any changes across my dependent variables exist based purely on political leaning. While I expect that there will not be any kind of overwhelming difference in effect rate, a difference in means statistical test, in this case a t-test, will be able to confirm or dispute that. If and when I am able to reach the conclusion that the effect rates have been similar, I will then begin my large analysis of variance.\n (See expanded plan in attached PDF)"}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "O'Connell Preregistration.pdf"}, "nodeId": "uzgs8", "sha256": "d914b015d3e6a5a57efbe859600c2ba407fefa37017a11c53d8cf1ff924128d1", "viewUrl": "/project/tcnuk/files/osfstorage/5e5d38eb86b40d0024d045d5/", "selectedFileName": "O'Connell Preregistration.pdf"}], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Humor and Opinion Frames in Political Podcasts", "q2": "Emily O'Connell", "q3": "The proposed experiment is part of a larger project seeking to categorize and assess the effectiveness of political podcasts on strengthening political attitudes and enhancing political knowledge.

The study is only seeking out United States citizens and will take approximately 5-6 minutes to complete.\n\nIn the pre-test phase, subjects will begin by reading provided IRB consent and disclosure forms and then clicking that they consent to be part of to the experiment. This disclosure section will make clear the need for subjects to take this survey on a device with audio player capability, and directly following the consent section, participants will be given an audio test to complete. In the attached audio there will be a stated four-digit number. Only with entry of that number (serving as an audio check), and with confirmation that they are a US citizen, will a participant be able to move forward. \n\nThe final pre-test question asks participants about their views on government spending, and the aim of this question is to calculate people\u2019s political leaning and already established attitude on government spending. Because the treatment in this experiment will involve a news story about a bill that seeks to spend public funds to fund school meals for America\u2019s youth, it is important to measure where people stand on government spending prior to exposure to this treatment. That measured attitude will then be used to sort people into a more conservative leaning or liberal leaning pool, though their subsequent assignment to one of the four treatments will remain random.\n\nAfter being sorted based on their measured political leanings, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (humor frames, punditry frames, hard news frames, and no audio treatment). Subjects in the first three treatment groups will be exposed to a 90 second audio clip about The Universal School Meals Program Act, a bill awaiting votes in the house and the senate that wants to provide free school meals to all children in American public schools. Treatment 1 involves a podcast clip revolving around this bill that is told with prevalent humor frames. Two different audio files have been created (one liberal leaning and one conservative) and while subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment, they will be placed in either liberal or conservative groups based on their pre-stated views on government spending. Similarly, treatment 2 is composed of a podcast clip about this bill that is told with punditry and opinion frames. It also has two different audio files, one for liberal listeners, and one for conservative. Treatment 3, composed of hard news framing of this proposed policy, has only one audio clip, and finally treatment 4 consists of no audio clip. In treatment 4, participants will move directly from the pre-test to the post-test. \n\nDirectly following whatever condition a participant was assigned to, study subjects will grade two questions on a seven point scale: Was the story clear? And, do you think the podcast contained false or misleading information? Following this, three knowledge questions that directly relate to the story will be asked. The intention in asking these stories is twofold: first, to see if participants were actively listening to the story, and second, to see if they learned anything from the story that members in the control group did not. They will then be asked questions about the importance of this school meals issue to the country, and whether they support the Universal School Meals Program Act having heard this podcast story clip. \n\nAfter giving their assessment on the story and the proposed policy, participants will be asked about their experiences with podcasts and political podcasts, how often they consume news media, and what American political parties they are likely to vote for. Through asking questions about their media consumption habits, how often they encounter podcasts, and what political parties they may be sympathetic towards, the hope is to have a more flushed out picture of what these participants bring bias-wise to the study. At this time, other important demographics like gender, race, age, and so on will be collected, using phrasing and flow mirroring Pew Research Center surveys, and a final comment section will be made available before the close of the survey. \n", "q8.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e5d38eb86b40d0024d045d5", "file_name": "O'Connell Preregistration.pdf", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/tcnuk/files/osfstorage/5e5d38eb86b40d0024d045d5", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e5d38eb86b40d0024d045d5"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "d914b015d3e6a5a57efbe859600c2ba407fefa37017a11c53d8cf1ff924128d1"}}], "q12.question": "Using MTurk to recruit 1500+ participants in my survey experiment.

In treatment one, participants will be exposed to a 90 second podcast story that uses humor in its storytelling. They receive a baseline of facts that is shared between all three of the audio treatment groups, but those facts are cushioned with jokes and sarcasm aimed at engaging and entertaining the audience in a different way than hard news storytelling. The humor frames have been recreated in a liberal condition and a conservative one, and while the jokes are different, the relative level of humor is the same, with a comparable number of jokes and as much flow and tone mirroring as possible. \n\nOpinion Frames. In treatment two, participants will be exposed to a 90 second podcast story that uses opinion frames in its storytelling. There will be a baseline of facts that is shared between all three of the audio treatment groups, but those facts are supplemented with opinion and punditry provided by the speakers in the audio clip. This opinion is an entertainment and persuasion tactic that is more exaggerated than opinion-based statements are in hard news storytelling. The punditry frames have been recreated in a liberal condition and a conservative one, and while the opinions are different, the relative amount of time dedicated to opinions, and much of the flow and tone are as closely identical as possible.\n\nHard News Frames. In treatment three, participants will be exposed to a 90 second podcast story that is based off of a typical hard news style. The baseline facts shared in all of the audio treatments will be available in this podcast clip as well, but those facts are elaborated and more detail is provided. The goal in this treatment was to limit bias in storytelling, and as such both liberal and conservative opinion have been mentioned and presented, but the podcast clip itself is meant to inform and not to persuade. There is only one hard news audio clip, as liberal and conservative viewpoints should still operate from the same pool of quantifiable facts and figures. \n", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "See attached appendixes of pre and post testing for a more comprehensive list of measured variables. \n\nPre-existing attitude on government spending. This variable will be measured in the pre-test with a question about government spending modeled after similar questions posed by ANES. \n\nPre-existing attitude on USMPA. This variable will be measured in the pre-test with a question about support for the Universal School Meals Program Act . The same question will be asked in an identical way in the post-test.\n\nPre-existing political preference. This variable will be measured with a question about what political parties participants are likely to vote for. On a scale of one to ten, assessments are made about Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, and the Green party, and the highest score will be taken as the measure of political preference. If all parties are scored the same, the respondent will be labeled an independent. \n\nPolitical attitude on USMPA and strengthening of that attitude. This is being measured so it can be compared across testing groups but also analyzed in conjunction with a similar question in the pretest. Measures for attitude will be assessed based on two questions regarding participant perception of the importance of this issue to the country, and their support of the proposed bill. \n\nPolitical news use and exposure. This will be assessed in the post-test through a question asking how frequently respondents interact with political news. \n\nPodcast use and exposure. This will be assessed in the post-test through two questions asking how frequently respondents listen to podcasts and to political podcasts specifically. \n\nPolitical Knowledge.  Three questions will be posed to participants about facts learned in the three audio treatments. By comparing listeners from those treatments to participants in the control group, these questions provide insight into how much knowledge is gained through listening to these three styles of political news storytelling. \n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "In order to make meaning from the collected data in this experiment, multiple analyses of variance (ANOVAs) will be necessary. Through assessing both between group variance and within group variance, the hope is to ascertain whether my independent variables have had any substantial effect on participants (MIT, \u201cLaboratory in Visual Cognition,\u201d 2008). This experiment has four potential treatment groups (humor frames, opinion frames, hard news frames, and no treatment), but has purposefully been kept limited and controlled in its design and scope. As such, ANOVA models can be used to compare the mean values collected during the experiment.  The purpose of assessing these means is to see what differences and discrepancies may have been measured as a result of the manipulated variables (Shikano, Br\u00e4uninger and Stoffel, 2012). \n\nAs has been outlined previously in this preregistration document, two of my treatment groups (humor frames and opinion frames) actually consist of two levels, one liberal and one conservative. This project has been designed in this way for a number of reasons. First, there are a number of sub-research questions I am asking about any potential differences between the framing effects of conservative podcasts and liberal ones. Second, in order to study the phenomena of political podcasts in a way that mirrors todays polarized, high-choice environment, two different treatment levels were needed. This being the case, I will of course test first between these two levels within each group, seeing if any changes across my dependent variables exist based purely on political leaning. While I expect that there will not be any kind of overwhelming difference in effect rate, a difference in means statistical test, in this case a t-test, will be able to confirm or dispute that. If and when I am able to reach the conclusion that the effect rates have been similar, I will then begin my large analysis of variance.\n (See expanded plan in attached PDF)", "q19.uploader":
