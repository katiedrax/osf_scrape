"registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "Stoicism and the good life\nWhat is a good life? Over the course of human history many different answers to this question have been suggest. The ancient Stoics suggested that a good life is a life full of meaning. Late stoic writers such as Epictetus outline a stoicism with the telos (end) of eudaimonia (meaning, flourishing) which can be achieved by living a virtuous life (Ierodiakonou, 2015; Long, 2002). A virtuous life was determined as a life following reason, dedicated to fulfilling ones role in life. Based on this conceptualization of virtue Stoics divided everything into three categories: virtue (acts in accordance with reason), vice (acts contrary to reason), and indifferents (all acts not classified as vice or virtue). While there is no gradient from vice to virtue, Stoics differentiate indifferents in preferred indifferents (enabling reason, such as health), disprefered indifferents (diminishing reasons, such as pain), and absolute indifferents (the colour of your wall). This division implied a rank order of importance virtues are preferable over indifferents, indifferents over vices (Inwood, 2003). This leads to adherents of Stoicism sometimes prioritizing acts over hedonic wellbeing or health if they enable reason and are beneficial to eudaimonic wellbeing (Becker, 2003, 2017).\nWhile few people explicitly follow stoic doctrine in modern times, stoic ideology is implicitly embraced by many individuals. Stoic ideology has long been endorsed by military personnel (Sherman, 2011). Outside the military field stoic thought has profoundly influenced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Robertson, 2016, 2019) and plays an important role in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Stoic philosophy has long influenced psychology, but little attention has been paid how individuals differ in their endorsement of stoic ideologies (for a thorough review of ancient stoicism and modern revivals we recommend Becker, 2017). Initial scales measuring stoicism mostly focused on a single dimensional construct assessed by past behaviours (Pathak et al., 2017). Recently a scale of stoic ideology has been developed, the Pathak-Wieten Stoicism Ideology Scale (PWSIS; Pathak et al., 2017), allowing for the assessment of individuals implicit endorsement of stoic ideology. This scale assesses stoic ideology comprised of four facets, Stoic Taciturnity (The belief that emotions should not be expressed), Stoic Serenity (The belief that strong emotions should not be felt), Stoic Endurance (The belief that physical suffering should be endured), and Death Acceptance (Accepting mortality, rather than fearing it).\nSo, what does this stoic ideology imply for individuals\u2019 wellbeing? Past research has shown negative relationship of stoicism and life satisfaction as well as positive relationships between stoicism and depression (Bei et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2008). Overall, this might lead to the conclusion that embracing stoic ideologies reduces wellbeing. While this might be true for hedonic wellbeing, Stoicism is an explicitly eudaimonic theory of wellbeing prioritizing meaning over pleasure. Currently no research is available that directly compares the effects of stoic ideology on hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. In the current study we aim to address this to further the understanding of stoic ideology as contributor to wellbeing.\nWe propose two hypotheses for the current research. First, given the conceptualization of Stoicism as eudaimonic theory of wellbeing, prioritizing eudaimonic wellbeing over hedonic wellbeing, we expect individuals that endorse a stoic ideology to show a greater orientation to eudaimonic rather than hedonic wellbeing. \nHypothesis 1: Stoicism is positively related to eudaimonic orientation and negatively to hedonic orientation to happiness.\n\tSecond, based on previous studies that found negative effects of Stoicism on hedonic wellbeing, we expect that individuals embracing stoic ideology have less hedonic wellbeing, but higher eudaimonic wellbeing.\nHypothesis 2: Stoicism is negatively related to hedonic wellbeing and positively related to eudaimonic wellbeing \nMethod\nParticipants\nWe will sample 400 undergraduate psychology students taking part in an introductory course to psychology. This sample size would give us the ability to detect a two-sided effect of r = .14 with a power of .80 and an \u03b1 error probability of .05. Because the endorsement of stoic ideology was strongly tied to a male gender identity in the past, we will aim to sample an even number of participants identifying as male and female. These students will fill out the provided measure as part of a larger survey pack examining their personal values and mindfulness. \nProcedure\nParticipants will be offered the study through an online portal and give the ability to complete the study online in their own time.\nMeasures\n\tDemographics. Participants will be asked to report their self-identified gender identity and current age.\nStoic Ideology. We will measure stoic ideology using the twelve item Pathak-Wieten Stoicism Ideology Scale (PWSIS; Pathak et al. 2017). The scale measures four constructs Endurance (\u201cI expect myself to hide my aches and pains from others.\u201d), Taciturnity (\u201cI don\u2019t believe in talking about my personal problems.\u201d), Serenity (\u201cI would prefer to be unemotional.\u201d), and Death Acceptance (\u201cI would not allow myself to be bothered by the fear of death.\u201d). All items will be measured on a scale from 1-(\u201cDisagree\u201d) to 5-(\u201cAgree\u201d). Before the main analysis all items will be recoded to range from -2 to +2 following the original scoring instructions.\nOrientation to Happiness. We will measure participants orientation to happiness using the eighteen item orientation to happiness questionnaire (Peterson et al., 2005). This questionnaire assesses three dimensions: \u201cA life of pleasure\u201d, \u201cA life of meaning\u201d, \u201cA life of engagement\u201d. The six items per scale are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u201cVery much unlike me\u201d) to 7 (\u201cVery much like me\u201d). Example items for each dimension are: \u201c. Life is too short to postpone the pleasures it can provide.\u201d (Pleasure), \u201cI have a responsibility to make the world a better place.\u201d (Meaning), and \u201cI am always very absorbed in what I do.\u201d (Engagement).\nEudaimonic Wellbeing.\nFlourishing. The Flourishing scale is a eight-item measure assessing individuals self-perceived success in relationships as well as self-esteem, purpose, and optimism (Diener et al., 2010). Participants responded on a Likert scale from 1-(\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d) to 7-(\u201cStrongly agree\u201d). An example item is, \u201cI am a good person and live a good life\u201d.\nMeaning in Life. The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (Steger et al., 2006) assesses the presence and search for meaning with ten items measures on a seven point Likert-scale ranging from 1-(\u201cAbsolutely untrue\u201d) to 7-(\u201cAbsolutely true\u201d). To measure eudaimonic wellbeing we will use the five item presence of meaning subscale. An example item is, \u201cI understand my life\u2019s meaning\u201d.\nHedonic Wellbeing.\nSatisfaction with life. The Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985) is a five-item measure of present, global life satisfaction, which comprise a cognitive judgment of a person\u2019s quality of life. Participants responded on a Likert scale from 1-(\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d) to 7-(\u201cStrongly agree\u201d). An example item is, \u201cI am satisfied with my current life\u201d.\nSubjective happiness. The subjective happiness scale (Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999) is a four-item measure of global happiness measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 7. The item anchors are relative to the items, first pair of items are anchored at 1-(\u201cLess happy\u201d) and 7-(More happy), the second pair of items are anchored at 1-(Not at all) to 7-(A great deal). \nThe classification of the scales as hedonic or eudaimonic is based on previous large scale research and reviews (Cooke et al., 2016; Disabato et al., 2016).\nData Analysis\nData Exclusion and Processing\n\tWe will exclude participants that did not finish the survey, as this can be interpreted as a withdrawal of consent. We will create an average score of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing for each participant across the individual measures after rescoring negatively worded items (Item four for subjective happiness, and item nine for meaning in life). \nEquivalence Testing.\n\tBecause previous research has indicated substantial gender differences in the mean score of stoic ideology, we will examine the equivalence of the PWSIS between male and female participants. We will use a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis to test for the equivalence of the structure, loadings, and intercepts. We will follow previously recommended guidelines (Fischer &amp; Karl, 2019). Equivalence between the differently constrained models will be supported by a drop of the confirmatory fit indicator (CFI) &lt; .01.\nHypotheses Testing\n\tTo test hypothesis one, we will create a SEM path-model in which the observed score of stoicism will predict the observed scores of hedonic and eudaimonic orientation to happiness. Our hypothesis will be supported if we find a significant negative relationship between stoic ideology and hedonic orientation to happiness and a positive relationship between stoic ideology and eudaimonic orientation to happiness. This would indicate that stoic ideology is indeed a eudaimonic approach to wellbeing as expected by its philosophical underpinnings.\nTo test hypothesis two, we will create a SEM path-model in which the observed score of stoicism will predict the observed scores of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing. Our hypothesis will be supported if we find a significant negative relationship between stoic ideology and hedonic wellbeing a positive relationship between stoic ideology and eudaimonic wellbeing. This would indicate that stoic ideology has differential effects on wellbeing, potentially leading individuals to prioritizing meaning over pleasure in life.\nExploratory Analyses\n\tWe propose a number of exploratory analysis, extending the current analysis beyond the proposed hypotheses. First we will examine the effect of the individual facets of stoic ideology on the outcome measure to identify facets that might be especially important. Further we will examine the effect of stoicism on the orientation to happiness subscale measuring a life of engagement, because neither theory nor empirical evidence predict a clear relationship we want to provide explorative evidence. Last, we want to examine the relationship between stoicism and search for meaning. \nReferences\nBecker, L. C. (2003). Human Health and Stoic Moral Norms.

Over the course of human history many different answers to this question have been suggest. The ancient Stoics suggested that a good life is a life full of meaning. Late stoic writers such as Epictetus outline a stoicism with the telos (end) of eudaimonia (meaning, flourishing) which can be achieved by living a virtuous life (Ierodiakonou, 2015; Long, 2002). A virtuous life was determined as a life following reason, dedicated to fulfilling ones role in life. Based on this conceptualization of virtue Stoics divided everything into three categories: virtue (acts in accordance with reason), vice (acts contrary to reason), and indifferents (all acts not classified as vice or virtue). While there is no gradient from vice to virtue, Stoics differentiate indifferents in preferred indifferents (enabling reason, such as health), disprefered indifferents (diminishing reasons, such as pain), and absolute indifferents (the colour of your wall). This division implied a rank order of importance virtues are preferable over indifferents, indifferents over vices (Inwood, 2003). This leads to adherents of Stoicism sometimes prioritizing acts over hedonic wellbeing or health if they enable reason and are beneficial to eudaimonic wellbeing (Becker, 2003, 2017).\nWhile few people explicitly follow stoic doctrine in modern times, stoic ideology is implicitly embraced by many individuals. Stoic ideology has long been endorsed by military personnel (Sherman, 2011). Outside the military field stoic thought has profoundly influenced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Robertson, 2016, 2019) and plays an important role in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Stoic philosophy has long influenced psychology, but little attention has been paid how individuals differ in their endorsement of stoic ideologies (for a thorough review of ancient stoicism and modern revivals we recommend Becker, 2017). Initial scales measuring stoicism mostly focused on a single dimensional construct assessed by past behaviours (Pathak et al., 2017). Recently a scale of stoic ideology has been developed, the Pathak-Wieten Stoicism Ideology Scale (PWSIS; Pathak et al., 2017), allowing for the assessment of individuals implicit endorsement of stoic ideology. This scale assesses stoic ideology comprised of four facets, Stoic Taciturnity (The belief that emotions should not be expressed), Stoic Serenity (The belief that strong emotions should not be felt), Stoic Endurance (The belief that physical suffering should be endured), and Death Acceptance (Accepting mortality, rather than fearing it).\nSo, what does this stoic ideology imply for individuals\u2019 wellbeing? Past research has shown negative relationship of stoicism and life satisfaction as well as positive relationships between stoicism and depression (Bei et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2008). Overall, this might lead to the conclusion that embracing stoic ideologies reduces wellbeing. While this might be true for hedonic wellbeing, Stoicism is an explicitly eudaimonic theory of wellbeing prioritizing meaning over pleasure. Currently no research is available that directly compares the effects of stoic ideology on hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. In the current study we aim to address this to further the understanding of stoic ideology as contributor to wellbeing.\nWe propose two hypotheses for the current research. First, given the conceptualization of Stoicism as eudaimonic theory of wellbeing, prioritizing eudaimonic wellbeing over hedonic wellbeing, we expect individuals that endorse a stoic ideology to show a greater orientation to eudaimonic rather than hedonic wellbeing. \nHypothesis 1: Stoicism is positively related to eudaimonic orientation and negatively to hedonic orientation to happiness.\n\tSecond, based on previous studies that found negative effects of Stoicism on hedonic wellbeing, we expect that individuals embracing stoic ideology have less hedonic wellbeing, but higher eudaimonic wellbeing.\nHypothesis 2: Stoicism is negatively related to hedonic wellbeing and positively related to eudaimonic wellbeing \nMethod\nParticipants\nWe will sample 400 undergraduate psychology students taking part in an introductory course to psychology. This sample size would give us the ability to detect a two-sided effect of r = .14 with a power of .80 and an \u03b1 error probability of .05. Because the endorsement of stoic ideology was strongly tied to a male gender identity in the past, we will aim to sample an even number of participants identifying as male and female. These students will fill out the provided measure as part of a larger survey pack examining their personal values and mindfulness. \nProcedure\nParticipants will be offered the study through an online portal and give the ability to complete the study online in their own time.\nMeasures\n\tDemographics. Participants will be asked to report their self-identified gender identity and current age.\nStoic Ideology. We will measure stoic ideology using the twelve item Pathak-Wieten Stoicism Ideology Scale (PWSIS; Pathak et al. 2017). The scale measures four constructs Endurance (\u201cI expect myself to hide my aches and pains from others.\u201d), Taciturnity (\u201cI don\u2019t believe in talking about my personal problems.\u201d), Serenity (\u201cI would prefer to be unemotional.\u201d), and Death Acceptance (\u201cI would not allow myself to be bothered by the fear of death.\u201d). All items will be measured on a scale from 1-(\u201cDisagree\u201d) to 5-(\u201cAgree\u201d). Before the main analysis all items will be recoded to range from -2 to +2 following the original scoring instructions.\nOrientation to Happiness. We will measure participants orientation to happiness using the eighteen item orientation to happiness questionnaire (Peterson et al., 2005). This questionnaire assesses three dimensions: \u201cA life of pleasure\u201d, \u201cA life of meaning\u201d, \u201cA life of engagement\u201d. The six items per scale are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\u201cVery much unlike me\u201d) to 7 (\u201cVery much like me\u201d). Example items for each dimension are: \u201c. Life is too short to postpone the pleasures it can provide.\u201d (Pleasure), \u201cI have a responsibility to make the world a better place.\u201d (Meaning), and \u201cI am always very absorbed in what I do.\u201d (Engagement).\nEudaimonic Wellbeing.\nFlourishing. The Flourishing scale is a eight-item measure assessing individuals self-perceived success in relationships as well as self-esteem, purpose, and optimism (Diener et al., 2010). Participants responded on a Likert scale from 1-(\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d) to 7-(\u201cStrongly agree\u201d). An example item is, \u201cI am a good person and live a good life\u201d.\nMeaning in Life. The Meaning in Life Questionnaire (Steger et al., 2006) assesses the presence and search for meaning with ten items measures on a seven point Likert-scale ranging from 1-(\u201cAbsolutely untrue\u201d) to 7-(\u201cAbsolutely true\u201d). To measure eudaimonic wellbeing we will use the five item presence of meaning subscale. An example item is, \u201cI understand my life\u2019s meaning\u201d.\nHedonic Wellbeing.\nSatisfaction with life. The Satisfaction With Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985) is a five-item measure of present, global life satisfaction, which comprise a cognitive judgment of a person\u2019s quality of life. Participants responded on a Likert scale from 1-(\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d) to 7-(\u201cStrongly agree\u201d). An example item is, \u201cI am satisfied with my current life\u201d.\nSubjective happiness. The subjective happiness scale (Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999) is a four-item measure of global happiness measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 7. The item anchors are relative to the items, first pair of items are anchored at 1-(\u201cLess happy\u201d) and 7-(More happy), the second pair of items are anchored at 1-(Not at all) to 7-(A great deal). \nThe classification of the scales as hedonic or eudaimonic is based on previous large scale research and reviews (Cooke et al., 2016; Disabato et al., 2016).\nData Analysis\nData Exclusion and Processing\n\tWe will exclude participants that did not finish the survey, as this can be interpreted as a withdrawal of consent. We will create an average score of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing for each participant across the individual measures after rescoring negatively worded items (Item four for subjective happiness, and item nine for meaning in life). \nEquivalence Testing.\n\tBecause previous research has indicated substantial gender differences in the mean score of stoic ideology, we will examine the equivalence of the PWSIS between male and female participants. We will use a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis to test for the equivalence of the structure, loadings, and intercepts. We will follow previously recommended guidelines (Fischer &amp; Karl, 2019). Equivalence between the differently constrained models will be supported by a drop of the confirmatory fit indicator (CFI) &lt; .01.\nHypotheses Testing\n\tTo test hypothesis one, we will create a SEM path-model in which the observed score of stoicism will predict the observed scores of hedonic and eudaimonic orientation to happiness. Our hypothesis will be supported if we find a significant negative relationship between stoic ideology and hedonic orientation to happiness and a positive relationship between stoic ideology and eudaimonic orientation to happiness. This would indicate that stoic ideology is indeed a eudaimonic approach to wellbeing as expected by its philosophical underpinnings.\nTo test hypothesis two, we will create a SEM path-model in which the observed score of stoicism will predict the observed scores of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing. Our hypothesis will be supported if we find a significant negative relationship between stoic ideology and hedonic wellbeing a positive relationship between stoic ideology and eudaimonic wellbeing. This would indicate that stoic ideology has differential effects on wellbeing, potentially leading individuals to prioritizing meaning over pleasure in life.\nExploratory Analyses\n\tWe propose a number of exploratory analysis, extending the current analysis beyond the proposed hypotheses. First we will examine the effect of the individual facets of stoic ideology on the outcome measure to identify facets that might be especially important. Further we will examine the effect of stoicism on the orientation to happiness subscale measuring a life of engagement, because neither theory nor empirical evidence predict a clear relationship we want to provide explorative evidence. Last, we want to examine the relationship between stoicism and search for meaning. \nReferences\nBecker, L. C. (2003). Human Health and Stoic Moral Norms.

contamination (e.g. microbiological pollution) and puts people at risk of adverse health related consequences. \n\nSafe water infrastructure can mitigate adverse health effects (Pokhrel, Bhandari, &amp; Viraraghavan, 2009), provided safe water is collected and consumed from there. However, safe water infrastructure is often not used or maintained in the long term (e.g. Naiga &amp; Penker, 2004). In this study, we test whether individual (habit) and social factors (psychological ownership) can promote the acceptance (i.e. attitudes and commitment), use, and functionality of safe water infrastructure. \n\nPsychological ownership (PO), i.e. the feeling that something is mine or ours (Pierce, Kostova, &amp; Dirks, 2001), is a concept from organisational psychology. It has also been suggested as a key factor related to the low acceptance, use and maintenance of safe drinking water infrastructure (Marks, Onda, &amp; Davis, 2013; Contzen &amp; Marks, 2018). For example, Marks &amp; Davis (2012) showed that the concept of PO is positively associated with use of a safe water source. However, experimental evidence on causality of this relationship is lacking.\nPsychological ownership theory suggests three routes, through which PO may be fostered. First, through perceived control over the target. Second, through intimately knowing the target. Third, through investing the self in the target (e.g. through investing money or time and effort; Pierce, Kostova, &amp; Dirks, 2001). Persons with greater PO for a target, in turn, are assumed to show more positive attitudes, and greater commitment for the target (Pierce et al., 2001). Concerning the context of health-related infrastructure, it is unknown, whether similar routes and consequences are applicable as in the organisational context. It is also unknown, whether PO leads to better acceptance, behaviour change (i.e. safe water consumption), and long-term functionality of safe water infrastructure.\n\nFunctional safe water infrastructure additionally has to be used in order to mitigate the risk of health related consequences. Therefore, a change in people\u2019s individual routines in water collection behaviour is required (Steg &amp; Vlek, 2008). Changing one\u2019s water collection behaviour to a new source in the long term requires discontinuing old habits (collecting water from an unsafe source) and forming new habits (collecting water from a safe source) (Orbell &amp; Verplanken, 2015). Habit is defined \u201c\u2026 as a process by which a stimulus generates an impulse to act as a result of a learned stimulus-response association\u201d (Gardner, 2015, p. 277). Due to the automaticity, habit is assumed to have long-lasting effects on behaviour change. A previous study on the promotion of arsenic-safe water consumption used commitment-based behaviour change techniques (Inauen &amp; Mosler, 2014, 2016; Inauen, Tobias, &amp; Mosler, 2014) that should promote habit development (Tobias, 2009). The intervention showed promising results to promote medium-term use of arsenic-safe water sources (Inauen &amp; Mosler, 2016). However, it has not been tested whether the interventions promote long-term safe water consumption via habit formation. Further, the long-term effect has only been investigated for a period &lt; 1 year.  \n\nIn a cluster-randomized controlled trial (c-RCT), we test whether PO for safe water infrastructure promotes acceptance, use, and functionality of the infrastructure in the long-term, and whether habit for safe water collection can additionally promote the use of this infrastructure in the long-term.

As an implicit measure for the extent of sense of agency the intentional binding paradigm can be used, describing the perceived temporal attraction of a voluntary action and its sensory consequences (see Moore &amp; Obhi, 2012 for a review).\nIn this regard, the modulating effect of physical effort (unrelated to the intentional binding task) on the intentional binding effect has already been shown in a study by Demanet, Muhle-Karbe, Lynn, Blotenberg and Brass (2013). Supporting their hypothesis, an enhanced intentional binding effect has been found in conditions with high physical effort, more precisely when participants were holding a stretch band of high resistance while performing a task assessing intentional binding, in comparison to trials with a stretch band of low resistance. Conversely, another relevant study has been conducted by Howard, Edwards and Bayliss (2016) who found a contra-directional impact of physical and mental effort (unrelated to the intentional binding task), with high effort leading to a decreased extent of intentional binding, arguing that the depletion of cognitive resources through high effort tasks disrupts the implicit sense of agency.\nThe purpose of our study is to examine the impact of cognitive task-related effort (related to the intentional binding task) on the intentional binding effect in a standardized laboratory experiment to complement prior studies on task-unrelated effort. To do so, we compare intentional binding for an easy (responding left/right to the auditory targets \u201cleft\u201d/\u201dright\u201d) and difficult cognitive task (responding with the same/opposite response depending on whether the auditory target is a vowel or consonant) which has to be performed to produce a tone effect. Similarly to Demanet et al. (2013), we assess the temporal judgement of either an executed action or a resulting consequence (tone) to determine the binding of action and effect, that is, the perceived sense of agency. Our research question therefore refers to the extent of intentional binding, more precisely the subjective compression of the temporal interval between our participants\u2019 own actions and their actions\u00b4 outcomes. Comparing conditions of two different task difficulties, we hypothesize that stronger intentional binding, that is, a stronger sense of agency, should be observed in conditions with high as compared to low task-related cognitive effort.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Manipulation check hypotheses:\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 mean reaction times should be longer in the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 mean error rates should be higher in the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 should rate the difficult task as more demanding as compared to the easy task in a post-experiment questionnaire.\n\nMain hypotheses: \n\u2022\tRelative to the baseline condition, participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of their actions should be shifted forward in time more strongly for the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tRelative to the baseline condition, participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of the effect tones should be shifted backwards in time more strongly for the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\nThat is, tasks of higher difficulty should lead to an increase in the intentional binding effect as compared to tasks of low difficulty\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

(2013). As an adaptation, the physical effort will be replaced by cognitive effort (related to the intentional binding task), in order to examine whether similar effects on sense of agency in accordance with the intentional binding paradigm can be observed.\nFor the purpose of integrating task-related cognitive effort into the intentional binding paradigm, the difficulty of simple cognitive tasks will be manipulated, creating two levels of task difficulty. \n \nStimuli and Apparatus\nParticipants will be seated in front of a 24\u201d monitor with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 144 Hz in a quiet, neutral and sound-attenuated room. A keyboard and a mouse will be placed in front of the participants, so that both number board and mouse will be in the middle of the table and easy to operate. Participants \u0301 left hand will rest on the number board. Participants \u0301 right index and middle fingers will rest on the left and right mouse key. Participants will be wearing headphones during the entire experiment. The experiment will be programmed using E-Prime (2.0.10.356, Psychology Tools Software).\nA clock with a rotating clock hand and typical five-minute-markers will serve as an orientation for participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of the action/effect occurrence. The clock has a diameter of 160 pixels (4.2\u00b0) r. The clock hand is sized 53 pixels and takes 2560 ms for one complete rotation. For every trial, the clock hand will start its rotation from a random position and disappears later in the trial (random interval after the participants\u00b4 reaction/the tone stimulus, depending on the trial type). Participants will judge the time at which an action/tone occurred by typing in the estimated minute count on the displayed clock on the number pad of the keyboard. \nVia the headphones, the auditory targets will be presented (~65 dB). For the easy task the German words \u201crechts\u201d and \u201clinks\u201d (German for \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d) will be used. For the difficult task, five consonants (K, P, M, Q, T) and five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) will serve as auditory targets. The auditory targets will be spoken by a neutral male voice in German language. This manipulation will be counterbalanced, so that half of the participants (according to their participant-number) will have to react to vowels by pressing the same key as in the previous trial (repeat; relative to previous correct response) and by pressing the opposite key when a consonant is presented (switch). For the other half of the participants, this mapping will be reversed. The first trial of each block will always be an easy task trial in order to set a start response.\nIn baseline tone blocks and operant blocks, a 600 Hz effect tone (100 ms, ~65 dB) will be used.\n\nProcedure\nAfter a brief task instruction, participants will execute four practice blocks with eight practice trials each. Each practice block represents one block type from the following main experiment and blocks are presented in a fixed order (baseline tone, baseline action, operant\u2026..). For the practice blocks including actions, the tasks will be randomly selected from ten easy (five left, five right) and ten difficult trials (five switch, five repeat, while each vowel/consonant will be presented up to once). Trials (easy/difficult) will be intermixed in random order(except for baseline tone blocks which do not contain a difficulty manipulation). \nThe experimenter will stay with the participant for all the practice blocks and answer questions. When all questions are answered and the task is made clear, the experimenter will leave the room and the participant will start the main experiment. At the beginning of each block a brief explanation of all blocks will be shown as a reminder and participants will be informed about the block type of the upcoming block.\nAfter the practice blocks, participants will execute the main experiment with eight experimental blocks with 40 trials each. Every block type will occur twice and the order of blocks will be intermixed. For each block including actions, 20 trials will contain the easy task (ten left, ten right) and 20 trials will contain the difficult task (ten switch, ten repeat, while each vowel/consonant will be presented twice). Blocks including actions started with an easy trial. Then easy and difficult trials will be randomly intermixed.\nTrial structure\nAt the beginning of each trial, the clock will be presented. The clock face will start rotating at a random position for every trial. After one to two clock rotations (duration random; 2560 \u2013 5120 ms) the trial will continue.\nbaseline tone blocks will not include any task difficulty manipulations and serve as a baseline measure of the temporal judgements for the tone. 2560 to 5120 ms after the clock starts rotating a tone will be presented. The clock will then continue to rotate for another 0.5 to one rotation after the tone (1280 - 2560 ms). After that, the clock will disappear, and participants will be prompted to judge the time of the tone by estimating the position of the clock hand at the moment the tone appeared. For doing so, the participants will have to type the corresponding time (minutes on the clock; 1 - 60 minutes) via the number board and confirm with Enter. Then, the next trial will start.\nAll other blocks will include auditory targets and a manipulation of task difficulty. Baseline action blocks serve as a baseline measure for the action judgement. After the clock has finished its initial rotation,participants will be presented with the trial\u00b4s auditory response target (easy or difficult task, see explanation above) via headphones. Participants will be instructed to respond  as fast and accurately as possible. They will also be instructed not to delay their response on purpose (e.g., to make time judgement easier afterwards). \nParticipants have to respond within 1500 ms from target onset. The clock will then continue to rotate until 0.5 - one rotation after the response (1280 - 2560 ms). If participants respond to early (prior to the target), incorrectly, or not in time, they will receive feedback in a red font for 1000 ms (\u201czu fr\u00fch!\u201d, German for \u201ctoo early!\u201d if they react too early; \u201cFehler!\u201d, German for \u201cerror!\u201d if they respond incorrectly; \u201czu langsam!\u201d, German for \u201ctoo slow!\u201d if they don\u2019t react within 1500 ms after target onset). After a correct response, when the clock disappears, participants will be prompted to judge the time of their action by estimating the position of the clock hand at the moment of their keypress by entering the corresponding number just like in baseline tone blocks.\nThe trials of operant blocks will be equivalent to baseline action blocks until participants execute a response. 250 ms after a correct response, a tone will be presented via headphones as an effect of their action. 0.5 to one rotation (1280 - 2560 ms) after that tone, the clock will disappear and participants will have to judge the time of their action or the time of the tone (constant per block and indicated beforehand), as described earlier.\nPost-experiment questionnaire\nEight post-experiment questions will be posed after the main experiment. In order to assess whether participants are na\u00efve to the purpose of the study and unaware of the study design, participants will be asked to write down their assumptions regarding the goal of the study (open response). After that, the perceived difficulty of each trial will be assessed via a five-point\u2013Likert scale from one (very easy) to five (very difficult). There will be two questions for the action trials. One related to the easy task (\u201cIn den Durchg\u00e4ngen, in denen du selber reagieren solltest: Als wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es zu reagieren, wenn du \"RECHTS!\" oder \"LINKS!\" \u00fcber die Kopfh\u00f6rer geh\u00f6rt hast?\u201d) and one related to the  difficult task (\u201cIn den Durchg\u00e4ngen, in denen du selber reagieren solltest: Als wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es zu reagieren, wenn du einen Vokal/Konsonanten geh\u00f6rt hast und die gleiche/entgegengesetzte Taste dr\u00fccken solltest? \u201c). Furthermore, one question will be aiming at the perceived difficulty of the temporal judgement (\u201cAls wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es, den Zeitpunkt deiner Reaktion/des Tons einzusch\u00e4tzen?\u201d). Then, there will be a question on participants\u2019 attentiveness (\u201cWie aufmerksam warst du w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung der Aufgabe?\u201d), again assessed via a five-point-Likert scale from one (very concentrated) to five (not concentrated at all). The next question aims at checking for possible tendencies of conscious manipulation in that participants might have postponed their responses to a certain point in time (\u201cWie selten/h\u00e4ufig hast du absichtlich deine Reaktion bis zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt verz\u00f6gert?\u201d). The last two questions of this post-experiment questionnaire will allow participants to mention experienced problems during the experiment or leave open comments on potential peculiarities (\u201cSind w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung irgendwelche Probleme aufgetreten? Wenn ja, bitte beschreibe diese Probleme.\u201d and \u201cIst dir w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung etwas an diesem Experiment besonders aufgefallen? Wenn ja, bitte beschreibe diese Besonderheit.\u201d). Responses to these questions will serve to determine whether participants perform their task correctly.

As an implicit measure for the extent of sense of agency the intentional binding paradigm can be used, describing the perceived temporal attraction of a voluntary action and its sensory consequences (see Moore &amp; Obhi, 2012 for a review).\nIn this regard, the modulating effect of physical effort (unrelated to the intentional binding task) on the intentional binding effect has already been shown in a study by Demanet, Muhle-Karbe, Lynn, Blotenberg and Brass (2013). Supporting their hypothesis, an enhanced intentional binding effect has been found in conditions with high physical effort, more precisely when participants were holding a stretch band of high resistance while performing a task assessing intentional binding, in comparison to trials with a stretch band of low resistance. Conversely, another relevant study has been conducted by Howard, Edwards and Bayliss (2016) who found a contra-directional impact of physical and mental effort (unrelated to the intentional binding task), with high effort leading to a decreased extent of intentional binding, arguing that the depletion of cognitive resources through high effort tasks disrupts the implicit sense of agency.\nThe purpose of our study is to examine the impact of cognitive task-related effort (related to the intentional binding task) on the intentional binding effect in a standardized laboratory experiment to complement prior studies on task-unrelated effort. To do so, we compare intentional binding for an easy (responding left/right to the auditory targets \u201cleft\u201d/\u201dright\u201d) and difficult cognitive task (responding with the same/opposite response depending on whether the auditory target is a vowel or consonant) which has to be performed to produce a tone effect. Similarly to Demanet et al. (2013), we assess the temporal judgement of either an executed action or a resulting consequence (tone) to determine the binding of action and effect, that is, the perceived sense of agency. Our research question therefore refers to the extent of intentional binding, more precisely the subjective compression of the temporal interval between our participants\u2019 own actions and their actions\u00b4 outcomes. Comparing conditions of two different task difficulties, we hypothesize that stronger intentional binding, that is, a stronger sense of agency, should be observed in conditions with high as compared to low task-related cognitive effort.\n", "q4": "Manipulation check hypotheses:\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 mean reaction times should be longer in the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 mean error rates should be higher in the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tParticipants\u00b4 should rate the difficult task as more demanding as compared to the easy task in a post-experiment questionnaire.\n\nMain hypotheses: \n\u2022\tRelative to the baseline condition, participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of their actions should be shifted forward in time more strongly for the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\u2022\tRelative to the baseline condition, participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of the effect tones should be shifted backwards in time more strongly for the difficult as compared to the easy task.\n\nThat is, tasks of higher difficulty should lead to an increase in the intentional binding effect as compared to tasks of low difficulty\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

(2013). As an adaptation, the physical effort will be replaced by cognitive effort (related to the intentional binding task), in order to examine whether similar effects on sense of agency in accordance with the intentional binding paradigm can be observed.\nFor the purpose of integrating task-related cognitive effort into the intentional binding paradigm, the difficulty of simple cognitive tasks will be manipulated, creating two levels of task difficulty. \n \nStimuli and Apparatus\nParticipants will be seated in front of a 24\u201d monitor with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 144 Hz in a quiet, neutral and sound-attenuated room. A keyboard and a mouse will be placed in front of the participants, so that both number board and mouse will be in the middle of the table and easy to operate. Participants \u0301 left hand will rest on the number board. Participants \u0301 right index and middle fingers will rest on the left and right mouse key. Participants will be wearing headphones during the entire experiment. The experiment will be programmed using E-Prime (2.0.10.356, Psychology Tools Software).\nA clock with a rotating clock hand and typical five-minute-markers will serve as an orientation for participants\u00b4 temporal judgements of the action/effect occurrence. The clock has a diameter of 160 pixels (4.2\u00b0) r. The clock hand is sized 53 pixels and takes 2560 ms for one complete rotation. For every trial, the clock hand will start its rotation from a random position and disappears later in the trial (random interval after the participants\u00b4 reaction/the tone stimulus, depending on the trial type). Participants will judge the time at which an action/tone occurred by typing in the estimated minute count on the displayed clock on the number pad of the keyboard. \nVia the headphones, the auditory targets will be presented (~65 dB). For the easy task the German words \u201crechts\u201d and \u201clinks\u201d (German for \u201cright\u201d and \u201cleft\u201d) will be used. For the difficult task, five consonants (K, P, M, Q, T) and five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) will serve as auditory targets. The auditory targets will be spoken by a neutral male voice in German language. This manipulation will be counterbalanced, so that half of the participants (according to their participant-number) will have to react to vowels by pressing the same key as in the previous trial (repeat; relative to previous correct response) and by pressing the opposite key when a consonant is presented (switch). For the other half of the participants, this mapping will be reversed. The first trial of each block will always be an easy task trial in order to set a start response.\nIn baseline tone blocks and operant blocks, a 600 Hz effect tone (100 ms, ~65 dB) will be used.\n\nProcedure\nAfter a brief task instruction, participants will execute four practice blocks with eight practice trials each. Each practice block represents one block type from the following main experiment and blocks are presented in a fixed order (baseline tone, baseline action, operant\u2026..). For the practice blocks including actions, the tasks will be randomly selected from ten easy (five left, five right) and ten difficult trials (five switch, five repeat, while each vowel/consonant will be presented up to once). Trials (easy/difficult) will be intermixed in random order(except for baseline tone blocks which do not contain a difficulty manipulation). \nThe experimenter will stay with the participant for all the practice blocks and answer questions. When all questions are answered and the task is made clear, the experimenter will leave the room and the participant will start the main experiment. At the beginning of each block a brief explanation of all blocks will be shown as a reminder and participants will be informed about the block type of the upcoming block.\nAfter the practice blocks, participants will execute the main experiment with eight experimental blocks with 40 trials each. Every block type will occur twice and the order of blocks will be intermixed. For each block including actions, 20 trials will contain the easy task (ten left, ten right) and 20 trials will contain the difficult task (ten switch, ten repeat, while each vowel/consonant will be presented twice). Blocks including actions started with an easy trial. Then easy and difficult trials will be randomly intermixed.\nTrial structure\nAt the beginning of each trial, the clock will be presented. The clock face will start rotating at a random position for every trial. After one to two clock rotations (duration random; 2560 \u2013 5120 ms) the trial will continue.\nbaseline tone blocks will not include any task difficulty manipulations and serve as a baseline measure of the temporal judgements for the tone. 2560 to 5120 ms after the clock starts rotating a tone will be presented. The clock will then continue to rotate for another 0.5 to one rotation after the tone (1280 - 2560 ms). After that, the clock will disappear, and participants will be prompted to judge the time of the tone by estimating the position of the clock hand at the moment the tone appeared. For doing so, the participants will have to type the corresponding time (minutes on the clock; 1 - 60 minutes) via the number board and confirm with Enter. Then, the next trial will start.\nAll other blocks will include auditory targets and a manipulation of task difficulty. Baseline action blocks serve as a baseline measure for the action judgement. After the clock has finished its initial rotation,participants will be presented with the trial\u00b4s auditory response target (easy or difficult task, see explanation above) via headphones. Participants will be instructed to respond  as fast and accurately as possible. They will also be instructed not to delay their response on purpose (e.g., to make time judgement easier afterwards). \nParticipants have to respond within 1500 ms from target onset. The clock will then continue to rotate until 0.5 - one rotation after the response (1280 - 2560 ms). If participants respond to early (prior to the target), incorrectly, or not in time, they will receive feedback in a red font for 1000 ms (\u201czu fr\u00fch!\u201d, German for \u201ctoo early!\u201d if they react too early; \u201cFehler!\u201d, German for \u201cerror!\u201d if they respond incorrectly; \u201czu langsam!\u201d, German for \u201ctoo slow!\u201d if they don\u2019t react within 1500 ms after target onset). After a correct response, when the clock disappears, participants will be prompted to judge the time of their action by estimating the position of the clock hand at the moment of their keypress by entering the corresponding number just like in baseline tone blocks.\nThe trials of operant blocks will be equivalent to baseline action blocks until participants execute a response. 250 ms after a correct response, a tone will be presented via headphones as an effect of their action. 0.5 to one rotation (1280 - 2560 ms) after that tone, the clock will disappear and participants will have to judge the time of their action or the time of the tone (constant per block and indicated beforehand), as described earlier.\nPost-experiment questionnaire\nEight post-experiment questions will be posed after the main experiment. In order to assess whether participants are na\u00efve to the purpose of the study and unaware of the study design, participants will be asked to write down their assumptions regarding the goal of the study (open response). After that, the perceived difficulty of each trial will be assessed via a five-point\u2013Likert scale from one (very easy) to five (very difficult). There will be two questions for the action trials. One related to the easy task (\u201cIn den Durchg\u00e4ngen, in denen du selber reagieren solltest: Als wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es zu reagieren, wenn du \"RECHTS!\" oder \"LINKS!\" \u00fcber die Kopfh\u00f6rer geh\u00f6rt hast?\u201d) and one related to the  difficult task (\u201cIn den Durchg\u00e4ngen, in denen du selber reagieren solltest: Als wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es zu reagieren, wenn du einen Vokal/Konsonanten geh\u00f6rt hast und die gleiche/entgegengesetzte Taste dr\u00fccken solltest? \u201c). Furthermore, one question will be aiming at the perceived difficulty of the temporal judgement (\u201cAls wie einfach/schwierig empfandest du es, den Zeitpunkt deiner Reaktion/des Tons einzusch\u00e4tzen?\u201d). Then, there will be a question on participants\u2019 attentiveness (\u201cWie aufmerksam warst du w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung der Aufgabe?\u201d), again assessed via a five-point-Likert scale from one (very concentrated) to five (not concentrated at all). The next question aims at checking for possible tendencies of conscious manipulation in that participants might have postponed their responses to a certain point in time (\u201cWie selten/h\u00e4ufig hast du absichtlich deine Reaktion bis zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt verz\u00f6gert?\u201d). The last two questions of this post-experiment questionnaire will allow participants to mention experienced problems during the experiment or leave open comments on potential peculiarities (\u201cSind w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung irgendwelche Probleme aufgetreten? Wenn ja, bitte beschreibe diese Probleme.\u201d and \u201cIst dir w\u00e4hrend der Bearbeitung etwas an diesem Experiment besonders aufgefallen? Wenn ja, bitte beschreibe diese Besonderheit.\u201d). Responses to these questions will serve to determine whether participants perform their task correctly. Participants\u00b4 whose responses indicate that they did not comply to the overall task instructions will be excluded from analyses.\nAfter the experiment, participants will receive course credit and will be informed about the purpose of the experiment.\n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Participants will mainly be recruited via a local web-based study participation platform where participants can sign up for studies they qualify for on the system.

For example, a depression scale (e.g., the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) could be used as a measure of caregiver adversity and stress, or as a measure of caregiver executive function and self-reported wellbeing, depending on context. Similarly, some items on the demographic form may be used as measures of caregiver adversity and stress (e.g., household income) and others may be used as covariates that do not fit into any category (e.g., age). Here, we include measures in the category in which they will be included for most analyses. \n\nMeasures of Caregiver (and Child) Adversity and Stress\nAdverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire\u2014Adult (Adult ACEs; Murphy et al., 2014). Caregivers complete the ACEs Questionnaire, which will be used to measure previous caregiver early life stress. \nAdverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire\u2014Child (Child ACEs; Murphy et al., 2014). Caregivers also complete the ACEs Questionnaire with regard to their child, which will be used to measure previous child early life stress. \nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977; Van Dam &amp; Earleywine, 2011).

Caregivers complete the short form 6-item questionnaire with regard to environmental home stress.\nChildren\u2019s Behavior Questionnaire Short-Form Version 1 (CBQ SF; Rothbart et al., 2000) a short version targeted at caregivers of children aged 3 to 8 years old. Caregivers are asked to rate their child on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely untrue of your child) to 7 (extremely true of your child). Caregivers are also provided with a not applicable response option when the child has not been observed in the situation described. \nDemographic 3.1 Primary Questionnaire. Caregivers complete a demographic form, which asks for general demographic information about themselves and their children (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational history, income, etc.), as well as service utilization and resource insecurity. \nEconomic Hardship Questionnaire (EHQ; Lempers, Clark-Lempers, &amp; Simons, 1989). Caregivers complete the 12-item Economic Hardship Questionnaire, which will be used to measure the degree of economic hardship perceived by caregivers. \nEyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg, 1999). Behavior specific rating scales completed by caregivers that assess the current frequency and severity of disruptive behaviors in the home and school settings, as well as the extent to which parents and/or teachers find the behavior troublesome. The instrument distinguishes normal behavior problems from conduct-disordered behavior in children and adolescents.\nOxidative Stress Questionnaire. Caregivers complete a short oxidative stress questionnaire, which will be used to assess lifestyle patterns that might be related to oxidative stress, such as nicotine use. \nParental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ; Luyten et al., 2017). A multidimensional self-report measure completed by caregivers that assesses parental reflective functioning or mentalizing. \nParental Stress Index-4 Short Form (PSI-4 SF; Abidin, 2012).

Caregiver\u2019s complete the 16-item questionnaire that aims to measure the trait of worry in caregivers using a likert scale. This instrument has a strong ability to differentiate between GAD from other anxiety disorders.\nPerceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983). Caregivers complete the 10-item questionnaire that measures the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one\u2019s life are appraised as stressful. \nProactive Control Inventory- Preventive Coping Scale (PCI; Greenglass et al., 1998). 10-Item subscale of the PCI completed by caregivers. Preventive coping deals with anticipation of potential stressor and the initiation of preparation before these stressors develop fully. \nProactive Control Inventory-Strategic Planning (PCI; Greenglass et al., 1998). 4-Item subscale of the Proactive Control Inventory completed by caregivers. The strategic planning instrument involves coping forms that depend on one\u2019s own efforts to change a situation. \nWheaton\u2019s Chronic Stress Inventory (WCS; Turner, Wheaton, &amp; Lloyd, 1995). Caregivers complete the Wheaton\u2019s Chronic Stress Inventory, which will be used to measure caregivers\u2019 perceptions of chronic stressors in their lives. \n\nCaregiver Neurobiological Measures\nEEG is recorded from caregivers during the following tasks. For all tasks, continuous EEG is recorded using a 64-channel Geodesic Sensor Net and sampled at 250 Hz using EGI software (Electrical Geodesic, Inc, Eugene, OR). Before data collection, all electrode impedances are reduced to below 50 k\u03a9. All electrodes are referenced online to Cz and will be re-referenced to the average off-line. \nAdult Doors Task (Caregiver EEG). To measure caregiver neural responses to their self rewards and non-rewards, caregivers complete a modified version of the Doors Task (Proudfit, 2015) in which caregivers are told that they can earn money, which they receive at the end of the experiment. Images of two doors are presented side by side, and caregivers are instructed to choose one door using a response pad. Following the response, a fixation is presented, then caregivers either see an image of a green thumbs-up, indicating a monetary reward, or a red thumbs-down, indicating no reward. \nChild Doors Task (Caregiver EEG). Children complete a variant of the Doors Task during caregiver observation. Caregiver-child dyads are told that the child is completing a guessing game while caregivers observe their child completing the game. Instead of monetary rewards, children receive sweet and/or salty edible treats of their choice (e.g., Goldfish, raisins). Children are given the amount of treats they win during breaks between trial blocks. Caregivers are seated adjacent to their child and instructed to watch the screen while their child completes the task. \nAX-CPT (Caregiver EEG). Caregivers complete the AX-type continuous performance test, which is a cognitive control task that can be used to examine context processing and goal maintenance. \nFlanker (Caregiver EEG). The Flanker is a computerized inhibitory control task that is a direct assessment measure of both attention and inhibitory control. The task is administered to the caregiver via a desktop computer monitor and a response pad. The test requires the caregiver to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing the same direction as congruent order, and sometimes in the opposite (incongruent) direction. \nOxidative Stress Measure (Caregiver urine and BMI collection). Collection of weight and height by scale are obtained to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a known confounder for oxidative stress. Caregivers assist their children with the urine sample. Urine samples are stored in a pad-locked-800C freezer located in a secure area of the UO Human Biology Research Laboratory. They are assayed for F2-Isoprostanes, a measure of oxidative stress, via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. \nCaregiver HRV. HRV comparison of baseline/resting physiological recording to the task/assessment physiological recording throughout the entire visit. Caregiver and child complete a three-minute baseline assessment to collect resting HRV while watching a relaxing child short film (\u201cBedtime Lullabies and Calming Undersea Animation: Baby Lullaby\u201d).\n\nMeasures of Caregiver Executive Function and Self-Reported Wellbeing \nFlanker (behavioral). In addition to recording EEG during the Flanker task, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time and accuracy (across trials and by trial type). \nAX-CPT (behavioral and proactive control). In addition to recording EEG during the AX-CPT task, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time, accuracy, d\u2019 context, A-Cue bias, and Proactive Shift Index. \nFive Minute Speech Sample (FMSS; Maga\u00f1a et al., 1986). The Five-Minute Speech Sample, sometimes referred to as the Expressed Emotion Interview, measures aspects of expressed emotion (EE), generally defined as a parent's emotional tone towards their child. The FMSS is administered during the follow-up phone call, during which caregivers are asked an open-ended question to prompt them to talk freely about their child for 5 minutes (e.g., \u201cTell me what kind of a person [child\u2019s name] is and how the two of you get along together.\u201d) The resulting audio recordings will be transcribed. Parental negativity and warmth expressed toward the child will be scored on a 0-5 point scale based on previously established scoring systems (Caspi et al., 2004; Kaugars et al., 2007).\nNIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory. Caregiver complete one cognition working memory task on an electronic tablet (i.e. iPad), a List Sorting Test.  The List Sorting test measures working memory through participant recall and sequences different visually and orally presented stimuli.  \n\nMeasures of Caregiving (and Home Environment)\nResponsive Caregiving. Caregiver-child dyads engage in a period of (a) free play, (b) clean-up, and (c) structured parent-child interaction tasks, which are video recorded. Videos will be coded using responsive caregiving measures. We are currently exploring reliable and valid measures of caregiving behavior.   \nParenting Sense of Competence (PSOC; Johnston &amp; Mash, 1989). A self-reporting instrument that assesses parent self-efficacy. The instrument, designed for parents with children birth-17 years of age, was originally developed by Gibaud-Wallston and Wandersman (1978) with skill knowledge and value competence subscales but has been translated and revised by Johnston and Marsh (1989) for use with older children.\nParental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ; Luyten et al., 2017). A brief self-report measure designed to assess parental reflective functioning (PRF). PRF is the ability to treat the child as a psychological agent. Reflective function refers to an individuals ability \u201cto hold others\u2019 minds in mind\u201d. This 18-item questionnaire encourages the caregiver to perceive both the self and others in terms of mental states, thereby making them meaningful, understandable, and predictable. \nStimQ2-Preschool (StimQ; Dreyer, Mendelsohn, &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 1996): The StimQ2-Preschool is an interview-based questionnaire designed to measure cognitive stimulation provided by the primary caregiver in the homes of young children ages 36-72 months (Mendelsohn et al., 2016). The measure is administered with the child\u2019s primary caregiver by trained interviewers during the follow-up phone call. It consists of 81 items total, divided into 4 sub scales: Reading, Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (PIDA), Parental Verbal Responsibility (PVR), and Availability of Learning Materials (ALM). The measure yields two types of scores: The Core Score includes the Reading, PIDA and PVR sub scores, while the Core + Supplemental Score includes the Core Score and the ALM sub score. \nConfusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS SF; Matheny et al., 1995). Described above. \n\nChild Neurobiological Measures\nChild Doors Task (EEG). Caregiver-child dyads complete a guessing task variant referred to as the doors task (Foti,Weinberg, Dien, Hajcak, 2011; Proudfit, 2015). This task has been shown to reliably elicit an FN in adults during execution (Levinson, Speed, Infantolino; Hajcak, 2017) and during caregiver observation of child performance (Levinson et al., 2017). During the traditional version of the task, images of two doors are presented side-by-side and participants are instructed to choose a door to obtain a reward. In the dyadic version, adapted from Levinson et al. (2017), caregivers chose the door themselves on half of the trials (\u2018caregiver-active trials\u2019), and observe their child choose a door on the other half of the trials (\u2018caregiver-observation trials).\nChild Zoo Game (EEG). During the zoo game, children are instructed that they are helping zookeeper Annie help catch the escaped animals from the zoo (See Zoo Game Script). Children are instructed to press a button whenever they see a picture of an animal (Go Trials). In addition, children are told that orangutans are helping zookeeper Annie. Thus, children are told to not press a button when they see an orangutan (No go Trials).  Children complete 8 blocks of 40 trials with 80% Go Trials, and 20% No-Go trials.\nChild Oxidative Stress Measure (Child urine and BMI collection). Collection of weight and height by scale are obtained to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a known confounder for oxidative stress. Caregivers assist their children with the urine sample. Urine samples are stored in a pad-locked-800C freezer located in a secure area of the UO Human Biology Research Laboratory. They are assayed for F2-Isoprostanes, a measure of oxidative stress, via gas chromatography- mass spectrometry.\nChild HRV. HRV comparison of baseline/resting physiological recording to the task/assessment physiological recording throughout the entire visit. Caregiver and child complete a three-minute baseline assessment to collect resting HRV while watching a relaxing child film (\u201cBedtime Lullabies and Calming Undersea Animation: Baby Lullaby\u201d).\n\nMeasures of Child Executive Function and Caregiver-Reported Behavior\nChildren\u2019s Behavior Questionnaire Short-Form Version 1 (CBQ SF; Rothbart et al., 2000). Described above.    \nEyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). Described above. \nChild Zoo Game (behavioral). In addition to recording EEG during the Zoo game, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time and accuracy (across trials and by trial type).\nChild EF Touch (Pick the Picture, Somethings the Same, Houses). Multitude of tasks that measures executive function; attention shifting, inhibitory control, and working memory. There are eight tasks in the EF touch program and takes between 45 and 60 minutes. Often not all of the tasks are administered together due to the age of the child, therefore it is appropriate for the child to move around between tasks. In this study, the three tasks administered are Pick the Picture, Something\u2019s the Same and Houses. The child responds via a touch screen laptop and the experimenter reads the directions from the external computer to the child.\nChild QUILS. The measure contains three major components: Vocabulary, Syntax, and Language Learning. In the Vocabulary section, children are given a number of choices and asked to select the correct picture that matches a given word. The Syntax measure assesses children's ability to understand different components of sentence structure (e.g. who vs. where vs. what), using a similar tablet-based picture selection task. Finally, the Language Learning component measures children's ability to learn new words, presenting nonsense words in context and asking children to select the picture that matches what the nonsense word means.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "N/A"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Before conducting each analysis, we will obtain relevant descriptive statistics and graphs to examine distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.

Caregiver adversity, including chronic stress, is known to negatively impact caregiving. Caregiving patterns, in turn, influence child neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral development. The present study examines various neurobiological correlates of stress among caregivers, as well as pathways by which caregiver adversity may impact caregiver executive functioning, caregiving behaviors, and child neurobiological, executive, and behavioral functioning. To examine the relationships between these measures, we are recruiting 100 caregiver-child dyads (child age: 3-6 years) to participate. Caregivers and children come into the laboratory for one 3.5-hour session, in which caregivers and children complete a series of tasks, including parent-child interaction tasks, questionnaires, and cognitive tasks. Electroencephalography (EEG) is recorded during some cognitive tasks. We also collect a range of biological measures. Finally, caregivers are invited to participate in a follow-up phone call, in which they complete two additional measures.

The direct effect from caregiving stress to caregiver observational RP (a) was estimated at \u03c1 = .35 based on previous findings between caregiver report of parenting and the caregiver observational RP (Levinson, Speed, Infantolino, et al., 2017) and based on previous literature about stress and RP (Foti &amp; Hajcak, 2009).

Caregivers complete the short form 6-item questionnaire with regard to environmental home stress.\nChildren\u2019s Behavior Questionnaire Short-Form Version 1 (CBQ SF; Rothbart et al., 2000) a short version targeted at caregivers of children aged 3 to 8 years old. Caregivers are asked to rate their child on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely untrue of your child) to 7 (extremely true of your child). Caregivers are also provided with a not applicable response option when the child has not been observed in the situation described. \nDemographic 3.1 Primary Questionnaire. Caregivers complete a demographic form, which asks for general demographic information about themselves and their children (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational history, income, etc.), as well as service utilization and resource insecurity. \nEconomic Hardship Questionnaire (EHQ; Lempers, Clark-Lempers, &amp; Simons, 1989). Caregivers complete the 12-item Economic Hardship Questionnaire, which will be used to measure the degree of economic hardship perceived by caregivers. \nEyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg, 1999). Behavior specific rating scales completed by caregivers that assess the current frequency and severity of disruptive behaviors in the home and school settings, as well as the extent to which parents and/or teachers find the behavior troublesome. The instrument distinguishes normal behavior problems from conduct-disordered behavior in children and adolescents.\nOxidative Stress Questionnaire. Caregivers complete a short oxidative stress questionnaire, which will be used to assess lifestyle patterns that might be related to oxidative stress, such as nicotine use. \nParental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ; Luyten et al., 2017). A multidimensional self-report measure completed by caregivers that assesses parental reflective functioning or mentalizing. \nParental Stress Index-4 Short Form (PSI-4 SF; Abidin, 2012).

Caregiver\u2019s complete the 16-item questionnaire that aims to measure the trait of worry in caregivers using a likert scale. This instrument has a strong ability to differentiate between GAD from other anxiety disorders.\nPerceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983). Caregivers complete the 10-item questionnaire that measures the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one\u2019s life are appraised as stressful. \nProactive Control Inventory- Preventive Coping Scale (PCI; Greenglass et al., 1998). 10-Item subscale of the PCI completed by caregivers. Preventive coping deals with anticipation of potential stressor and the initiation of preparation before these stressors develop fully. \nProactive Control Inventory-Strategic Planning (PCI; Greenglass et al., 1998). 4-Item subscale of the Proactive Control Inventory completed by caregivers. The strategic planning instrument involves coping forms that depend on one\u2019s own efforts to change a situation. \nWheaton\u2019s Chronic Stress Inventory (WCS; Turner, Wheaton, &amp; Lloyd, 1995). Caregivers complete the Wheaton\u2019s Chronic Stress Inventory, which will be used to measure caregivers\u2019 perceptions of chronic stressors in their lives. \n\nCaregiver Neurobiological Measures\nEEG is recorded from caregivers during the following tasks. For all tasks, continuous EEG is recorded using a 64-channel Geodesic Sensor Net and sampled at 250 Hz using EGI software (Electrical Geodesic, Inc, Eugene, OR). Before data collection, all electrode impedances are reduced to below 50 k\u03a9. All electrodes are referenced online to Cz and will be re-referenced to the average off-line. \nAdult Doors Task (Caregiver EEG). To measure caregiver neural responses to their self rewards and non-rewards, caregivers complete a modified version of the Doors Task (Proudfit, 2015) in which caregivers are told that they can earn money, which they receive at the end of the experiment. Images of two doors are presented side by side, and caregivers are instructed to choose one door using a response pad. Following the response, a fixation is presented, then caregivers either see an image of a green thumbs-up, indicating a monetary reward, or a red thumbs-down, indicating no reward. \nChild Doors Task (Caregiver EEG). Children complete a variant of the Doors Task during caregiver observation. Caregiver-child dyads are told that the child is completing a guessing game while caregivers observe their child completing the game. Instead of monetary rewards, children receive sweet and/or salty edible treats of their choice (e.g., Goldfish, raisins). Children are given the amount of treats they win during breaks between trial blocks. Caregivers are seated adjacent to their child and instructed to watch the screen while their child completes the task. \nAX-CPT (Caregiver EEG). Caregivers complete the AX-type continuous performance test, which is a cognitive control task that can be used to examine context processing and goal maintenance. \nFlanker (Caregiver EEG). The Flanker is a computerized inhibitory control task that is a direct assessment measure of both attention and inhibitory control. The task is administered to the caregiver via a desktop computer monitor and a response pad. The test requires the caregiver to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing the same direction as congruent order, and sometimes in the opposite (incongruent) direction. \nOxidative Stress Measure (Caregiver urine and BMI collection). Collection of weight and height by scale are obtained to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a known confounder for oxidative stress. Caregivers assist their children with the urine sample. Urine samples are stored in a pad-locked-800C freezer located in a secure area of the UO Human Biology Research Laboratory. They are assayed for F2-Isoprostanes, a measure of oxidative stress, via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. \nCaregiver HRV. HRV comparison of baseline/resting physiological recording to the task/assessment physiological recording throughout the entire visit. Caregiver and child complete a three-minute baseline assessment to collect resting HRV while watching a relaxing child short film (\u201cBedtime Lullabies and Calming Undersea Animation: Baby Lullaby\u201d).\n\nMeasures of Caregiver Executive Function and Self-Reported Wellbeing \nFlanker (behavioral). In addition to recording EEG during the Flanker task, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time and accuracy (across trials and by trial type). \nAX-CPT (behavioral and proactive control). In addition to recording EEG during the AX-CPT task, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time, accuracy, d\u2019 context, A-Cue bias, and Proactive Shift Index. \nFive Minute Speech Sample (FMSS; Maga\u00f1a et al., 1986). The Five-Minute Speech Sample, sometimes referred to as the Expressed Emotion Interview, measures aspects of expressed emotion (EE), generally defined as a parent's emotional tone towards their child. The FMSS is administered during the follow-up phone call, during which caregivers are asked an open-ended question to prompt them to talk freely about their child for 5 minutes (e.g., \u201cTell me what kind of a person [child\u2019s name] is and how the two of you get along together.\u201d) The resulting audio recordings will be transcribed. Parental negativity and warmth expressed toward the child will be scored on a 0-5 point scale based on previously established scoring systems (Caspi et al., 2004; Kaugars et al., 2007).\nNIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory. Caregiver complete one cognition working memory task on an electronic tablet (i.e. iPad), a List Sorting Test.  The List Sorting test measures working memory through participant recall and sequences different visually and orally presented stimuli.  \n\nMeasures of Caregiving (and Home Environment)\nResponsive Caregiving. Caregiver-child dyads engage in a period of (a) free play, (b) clean-up, and (c) structured parent-child interaction tasks, which are video recorded. Videos will be coded using responsive caregiving measures. We are currently exploring reliable and valid measures of caregiving behavior.   \nParenting Sense of Competence (PSOC; Johnston &amp; Mash, 1989). A self-reporting instrument that assesses parent self-efficacy. The instrument, designed for parents with children birth-17 years of age, was originally developed by Gibaud-Wallston and Wandersman (1978) with skill knowledge and value competence subscales but has been translated and revised by Johnston and Marsh (1989) for use with older children.\nParental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ; Luyten et al., 2017). A brief self-report measure designed to assess parental reflective functioning (PRF). PRF is the ability to treat the child as a psychological agent. Reflective function refers to an individuals ability \u201cto hold others\u2019 minds in mind\u201d. This 18-item questionnaire encourages the caregiver to perceive both the self and others in terms of mental states, thereby making them meaningful, understandable, and predictable. \nStimQ2-Preschool (StimQ; Dreyer, Mendelsohn, &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 1996): The StimQ2-Preschool is an interview-based questionnaire designed to measure cognitive stimulation provided by the primary caregiver in the homes of young children ages 36-72 months (Mendelsohn et al., 2016). The measure is administered with the child\u2019s primary caregiver by trained interviewers during the follow-up phone call. It consists of 81 items total, divided into 4 sub scales: Reading, Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (PIDA), Parental Verbal Responsibility (PVR), and Availability of Learning Materials (ALM). The measure yields two types of scores: The Core Score includes the Reading, PIDA and PVR sub scores, while the Core + Supplemental Score includes the Core Score and the ALM sub score. \nConfusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS SF; Matheny et al., 1995). Described above. \n\nChild Neurobiological Measures\nChild Doors Task (EEG). Caregiver-child dyads complete a guessing task variant referred to as the doors task (Foti,Weinberg, Dien, Hajcak, 2011; Proudfit, 2015). This task has been shown to reliably elicit an FN in adults during execution (Levinson, Speed, Infantolino; Hajcak, 2017) and during caregiver observation of child performance (Levinson et al., 2017). During the traditional version of the task, images of two doors are presented side-by-side and participants are instructed to choose a door to obtain a reward. In the dyadic version, adapted from Levinson et al. (2017), caregivers chose the door themselves on half of the trials (\u2018caregiver-active trials\u2019), and observe their child choose a door on the other half of the trials (\u2018caregiver-observation trials).\nChild Zoo Game (EEG). During the zoo game, children are instructed that they are helping zookeeper Annie help catch the escaped animals from the zoo (See Zoo Game Script). Children are instructed to press a button whenever they see a picture of an animal (Go Trials). In addition, children are told that orangutans are helping zookeeper Annie. Thus, children are told to not press a button when they see an orangutan (No go Trials).  Children complete 8 blocks of 40 trials with 80% Go Trials, and 20% No-Go trials.\nChild Oxidative Stress Measure (Child urine and BMI collection). Collection of weight and height by scale are obtained to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a known confounder for oxidative stress. Caregivers assist their children with the urine sample. Urine samples are stored in a pad-locked-800C freezer located in a secure area of the UO Human Biology Research Laboratory. They are assayed for F2-Isoprostanes, a measure of oxidative stress, via gas chromatography- mass spectrometry.\nChild HRV. HRV comparison of baseline/resting physiological recording to the task/assessment physiological recording throughout the entire visit. Caregiver and child complete a three-minute baseline assessment to collect resting HRV while watching a relaxing child film (\u201cBedtime Lullabies and Calming Undersea Animation: Baby Lullaby\u201d).\n\nMeasures of Child Executive Function and Caregiver-Reported Behavior\nChildren\u2019s Behavior Questionnaire Short-Form Version 1 (CBQ SF; Rothbart et al., 2000). Described above.    \nEyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). Described above. \nChild Zoo Game (behavioral). In addition to recording EEG during the Zoo game, we collect behavioral measures, including reaction time and accuracy (across trials and by trial type).\nChild EF Touch (Pick the Picture, Somethings the Same, Houses). Multitude of tasks that measures executive function; attention shifting, inhibitory control, and working memory. There are eight tasks in the EF touch program and takes between 45 and 60 minutes. Often not all of the tasks are administered together due to the age of the child, therefore it is appropriate for the child to move around between tasks. In this study, the three tasks administered are Pick the Picture, Something\u2019s the Same and Houses. The child responds via a touch screen laptop and the experimenter reads the directions from the external computer to the child.\nChild QUILS. The measure contains three major components: Vocabulary, Syntax, and Language Learning. In the Vocabulary section, children are given a number of choices and asked to select the correct picture that matches a given word. The Syntax measure assesses children's ability to understand different components of sentence structure (e.g. who vs. where vs. what), using a similar tablet-based picture selection task. Finally, the Language Learning component measures children's ability to learn new words, presenting nonsense words in context and asking children to select the picture that matches what the nonsense word means.\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "N/A", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "Before conducting each analysis, we will obtain relevant descriptive statistics and graphs to examine distributions, trends, and relationships between variables.
