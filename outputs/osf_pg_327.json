We will aim to capture a 24-month snapshot of current trends in practice in a series of international centres covering patients treated between the 1st January 2017 until 31st December 2018, allowing follow-up for at least a year. This audit will include all patients presenting to participant centres with open lower limb fractures. We aim to retrieve information regarding: type and severity of injuries; comorbidities and smoking status; timing for debridement and definitive soft tissue reconstruction; flap selection (free versus local and muscle versus fasciocutaneous flaps); type of bony fixation; antibiotics prophylaxis; flap loss rate, re-exploration rates; thromboembolism rates; postoperative infection rates; length of inpatient stay; time to full weight-bearing; non-union rates; osteomyelitis rates and time to return to work.\n\nTo coordinate this multinational project the International Lower Limb Reconstruction Collaborative (INTELLECT) in partnership with RSTN will identify key clinicians at trauma centres in the United Kingdom and overseas. These will be responsible for seeking approval for local audits as per their national legal frameworks and will be responsible for supervising data collection. We will encourage trainees and medical students (contributors) to gather data for this study using well established models developed by the RSTN. A coordinating team at the Surgical Interventional Trials Unit (a Royal College of Surgeons supported trials units in Oxford) will coordinate collection of anonymised data using the GDPR-compliant REDCap software. \n", "q8.uploader": [], "q12.question": "Through RSTN, BAPRAS and the University of Oxford, invitations will be sent to major trauma centres in the United Kingdom and all over the world.

The majority of people in the UK are categorised as \u2018high meat consumers\u2019, suggesting dietary Green House Gas (GHG) emission is one of the big contributors of climate change (Scarborough et al., 2014). Therefore, many food scientists are putting effort to develop strategies to encourage consumers to have a plant-based diet (Smil, 2002). However, a change in eating habits can be challenging and met with resistance. This study aims to understand i) how meat eaters perceive plant-based foods, ii) what their expectations are of these sources and iii) how much their expectancy and experience is consistent in tasting a plant-based burger. To investigate these aims, we will recruit 72 participants from community members and students (UoB) and 48 participants will be meat eaters and 24 participants will be vegans and vegetarians.

The majority of people in the UK are categorised as \u2018high meat consumers\u2019, suggesting dietary Green House Gas (GHG) emission is one of the big contributors of climate change (Scarborough et al., 2014). Therefore, many food scientists are putting effort to develop strategies to encourage consumers to have a plant-based diet (Smil, 2002). However, a change in eating habits can be challenging and met with resistance. This study aims to understand i) how meat eaters perceive plant-based foods, ii) what their expectations are of these sources and iii) how much their expectancy and experience is consistent in tasting a plant-based burger. To investigate these aims, we will recruit 72 participants from community members and students (UoB) and 48 participants will be meat eaters and 24 participants will be vegans and vegetarians. They will be randomly allocated into three conditions. Conditions will have the same food (plant-based burger) with different neutral descriptions. In condition 1, the burger will be labelled as \u2018plant-based burger\u2019 and meat eaters will be in this condition. In the second condition the burger will be presented as a \u2018meat burger\u2019 to the other 24 meat eaters. In the third condition, there will be no manipulation and vegans and vegetarians will be offered a plant-based burger labelled as \u2018plant-based burger\u2019.  Appetite ratings (liking, fullness and satisfaction) will be measured twice (expected and after eating) by using a standard 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  There will a digital hand dynamometer as an additional measure to understand how eating affects acute strength. We predicted that participants in plant-based condition will report less enjoyment and less satisfaction compared to participants in meat burger condition. In addition, in plant-based burger condition, there will be a significant difference in expected liking and experienced (during eating) liking. Overall, this study will help researchers to develop new interventions to encourage consumers to eat more plant-based foods to reduce dietary GHG emission.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-02-05T16:39:53.421625", "date_modified": "2020-02-05T16:35:01.431508", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Meat eaters vs. vegans and vegetarians", "NBU", "Plant-based burger", "Pleasantness", "University of Bristol"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": null, "analytics_key": "14ad37c7ba1fd49c8c8295ed9465be76bb49f1d0b4c968834fed8e36cdc88bedaa0fa7926a12445ea89bd6ef059f13ef9e71102157825739a0b530871afa3224282d3b39899d650c372b08160c3f25f35904e8d072f55f44d649c9cfddd070cc9ba6b2e27ca0fdfea65d18e0e5f662e4f374924de3a4aa6e25cef03d18ed080a74e4e0a97c475066b3219c059f808556", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-02-05T16:39:53.393683", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "Open-Ended Registration", "registered_meta": {"summary": {"extra": [], "value": "This is a registration of study plans before data collection.
