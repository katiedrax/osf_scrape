We will replicate and update the search strategy used in the previous systematic review to identify additional relevant studies published since the initial publication. \n\nCONDITION OR DOMAIN BEING STUDIED\nGastrointestinal bleeding in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n\nCONTEXT\nThe COGENT trial, published in 2010, demonstrated that omeprazole reduces the risk of gastrointestinal events in patients treated with DAPT after PCI without increasing the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events 1. This formed the basis for professional society recommendations that PPI is appropriate in patients on DAPT 2. However, PPIs continue to be used at low rates in patients who receive DAPT after PCI.\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nThis review follows the same criteria used in the systematic review being updated 3. All eligibility criteria from the original review will be identified below. \n\nPARTICIPANTS/POPULATION\nInclusion (per original study): \n\u2022\tAdults (aged \u2265 18 years) \n\u2022\tPatients receiving DAPT after the implantation of coronary stents\n\nExclusion (per original study): \n\u2022\tPatients who receive long-term warfarin or similar anticoagulant therapy\n\u2022\tPatients who receive DAPT shorter than 3 months\n\nINTERVENTION(S)/EXPOSURE(S) (per original study)\nDAPT, defined as aspirin along with concurrent P2Y12 receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor) given for a period of either 3-6 months (short term), 12 months (standard), or &gt;12 months (long-term). \n\nCOMPARATOR(S)/CONTROL(S)\nDAPT given for a different period of time, either short term, standard, or long term.\n\nTYPES OF STUDIES TO BE INCLUDED\nInclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tRCTs comparing varying durations of DAPT\n\u2022\tClinical outcomes of included studies should include the following events: death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke\n\u2022\tSufficient data should be provided in original studies\n\nExclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tAnalyses of non-randomized trials\n\u2022\tCross-sectional studies\n\u2022\tCase reports or case series\n\u2022\tOngoing or prematurely terminated trials\n\u2022\tStudies published in a language other than English  \n\nMAIN OUTCOME\nFor this systematic review, the main outcome will be any specifications made about treatment with PPI therapy in the study protocol for patients on DAPT (e.g., all patients recommended to take PPI, PPI not allowed, treatment of PPI in specific sub-groups or at certain times, at the discretion of treating clinicians).\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES\nSpecifications for evaluating prevalence of PPI use in participants, participant characteristics related to GI bleeding risk (including age, history of peptic ulcer disease or upper GI bleeding, NSAID use, PPI use), and how bleeding events are classified in each study (TIMI, Gusto, BARC, etc)\n\nInclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tAll-cause mortality rate\n\u2022\tCardiac mortality rate\n\u2022\tFrequency of myocardial infarction\n\nTIMING OF THE EFFECT MEASURES\nPer the original systematic review, cardiac mortality is defined as dying of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest. Myocardial infarction includes both Q-wave and non-Q-wave type.\n\nADDITIONAL OUTCOME(S)\nAdditional outcomes will include: prevalence of PPI use in study participants during any portion of the time patients were treated with DAPT, specification of location of bleeding site (i.e., upper vs. lower gastrointestinal tract), bleeding classification system used (e.g., TIMI, BARC), other protocol specifications for reducing participants\u2019 GI bleeding risk (e.g., no NSAID use). \n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION - SELECTION AND CODING\nTitles and abstracts for articles will be screened independently by two reviewers (AK, KP) and all articles deemed to be potentially relevant at this stage will be retrieved in full text. The full text articles will be independently assessed by two reviewers (DH, AK) to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. Any disagreements regarding full text study eligibility for inclusion will result in discussion between the two reviewers and adjudication by a third reviewer (JK) if necessary. For studies that are reviewed in full text but not eligible for inclusion, the reason for study exclusion will be documented. A flowchart following the PRISMA statement will be created to demonstrate the phases of this process. \nWe will obtain the trial protocol for each study by reviewing the description of the study in the original publication, clinicaltrials.gov or any other trial registry used, reviewing journal websites for any supplemental information, or any other online resources referenced in the study publication. For RCTs where the trial protocol is not available, we will contact the primary author.\n\nRISK OF BIAS (QUALITY) ASSESSMENT\nRisk of bias will not be assessed as we are focused only on trial protocols and patient characteristics. \n\nSTRATEGY FOR DATA SYNTHESIS\nFor all RCTs included in this systematic methodology review, including those previously identified in the 2019 publication as well as any additional articles found since the original search, two reviewers will independently extract the following data from the trial protocol: general information (authors, funding, conflicts of interest), study characteristics (inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study duration), study protocol design (protocol specifications for PPI use in the trial, specifications for reducing participants GI bleeding risk, specifications for evaluating prevalence of PPI use in participants), participant characteristics related to GI bleeding risk (including age, history of peptic ulcer disease or upper GI bleeding, NSAID use, PPI use, H2 blocker use), and how bleeding events are classified in each study (TIMI, Gusto, BARC, etc). A standardized data extraction form will be used for documenting data for each included trial. This form will be piloted to determine whether any amendments are required. Any disagreements on data extraction will be resolved by discussion between the two reviewers.

We will replicate and update the search strategy used in the previous systematic review to identify additional relevant studies published since the initial publication. \n\nCONDITION OR DOMAIN BEING STUDIED\nGastrointestinal bleeding in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n\nCONTEXT\nThe COGENT trial, published in 2010, demonstrated that omeprazole reduces the risk of gastrointestinal events in patients treated with DAPT after PCI without increasing the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events 1. This formed the basis for professional society recommendations that PPI is appropriate in patients on DAPT 2. However, PPIs continue to be used at low rates in patients who receive DAPT after PCI.\n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA\nThis review follows the same criteria used in the systematic review being updated 3. All eligibility criteria from the original review will be identified below. \n\nPARTICIPANTS/POPULATION\nInclusion (per original study): \n\u2022\tAdults (aged \u2265 18 years) \n\u2022\tPatients receiving DAPT after the implantation of coronary stents\n\nExclusion (per original study): \n\u2022\tPatients who receive long-term warfarin or similar anticoagulant therapy\n\u2022\tPatients who receive DAPT shorter than 3 months\n\nINTERVENTION(S)/EXPOSURE(S) (per original study)\nDAPT, defined as aspirin along with concurrent P2Y12 receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor) given for a period of either 3-6 months (short term), 12 months (standard), or &gt;12 months (long-term). \n\nCOMPARATOR(S)/CONTROL(S)\nDAPT given for a different period of time, either short term, standard, or long term.\n\nTYPES OF STUDIES TO BE INCLUDED\nInclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tRCTs comparing varying durations of DAPT\n\u2022\tClinical outcomes of included studies should include the following events: death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke\n\u2022\tSufficient data should be provided in original studies\n\nExclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tAnalyses of non-randomized trials\n\u2022\tCross-sectional studies\n\u2022\tCase reports or case series\n\u2022\tOngoing or prematurely terminated trials\n\u2022\tStudies published in a language other than English  \n\nMAIN OUTCOME\nFor this systematic review, the main outcome will be any specifications made about treatment with PPI therapy in the study protocol for patients on DAPT (e.g., all patients recommended to take PPI, PPI not allowed, treatment of PPI in specific sub-groups or at certain times, at the discretion of treating clinicians).\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES\nSpecifications for evaluating prevalence of PPI use in participants, participant characteristics related to GI bleeding risk (including age, history of peptic ulcer disease or upper GI bleeding, NSAID use, PPI use), and how bleeding events are classified in each study (TIMI, Gusto, BARC, etc)\n\nInclusion (per original study):\n\u2022\tAll-cause mortality rate\n\u2022\tCardiac mortality rate\n\u2022\tFrequency of myocardial infarction\n\nTIMING OF THE EFFECT MEASURES\nPer the original systematic review, cardiac mortality is defined as dying of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or cardiac arrest. Myocardial infarction includes both Q-wave and non-Q-wave type.\n\nADDITIONAL OUTCOME(S)\nAdditional outcomes will include: prevalence of PPI use in study participants during any portion of the time patients were treated with DAPT, specification of location of bleeding site (i.e., upper vs. lower gastrointestinal tract), bleeding classification system used (e.g., TIMI, BARC), other protocol specifications for reducing participants\u2019 GI bleeding risk (e.g., no NSAID use). \n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION - SELECTION AND CODING\nTitles and abstracts for articles will be screened independently by two reviewers (AK, KP) and all articles deemed to be potentially relevant at this stage will be retrieved in full text. The full text articles will be independently assessed by two reviewers (DH, AK) to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. Any disagreements regarding full text study eligibility for inclusion will result in discussion between the two reviewers and adjudication by a third reviewer (JK) if necessary. For studies that are reviewed in full text but not eligible for inclusion, the reason for study exclusion will be documented. A flowchart following the PRISMA statement will be created to demonstrate the phases of this process. \nWe will obtain the trial protocol for each study by reviewing the description of the study in the original publication, clinicaltrials.gov or any other trial registry used, reviewing journal websites for any supplemental information, or any other online resources referenced in the study publication. For RCTs where the trial protocol is not available, we will contact the primary author.\n\nRISK OF BIAS (QUALITY) ASSESSMENT\nRisk of bias will not be assessed as we are focused only on trial protocols and patient characteristics. \n\nSTRATEGY FOR DATA SYNTHESIS\nFor all RCTs included in this systematic methodology review, including those previously identified in the 2019 publication as well as any additional articles found since the original search, two reviewers will independently extract the following data from the trial protocol: general information (authors, funding, conflicts of interest), study characteristics (inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, study duration), study protocol design (protocol specifications for PPI use in the trial, specifications for reducing participants GI bleeding risk, specifications for evaluating prevalence of PPI use in participants), participant characteristics related to GI bleeding risk (including age, history of peptic ulcer disease or upper GI bleeding, NSAID use, PPI use, H2 blocker use), and how bleeding events are classified in each study (TIMI, Gusto, BARC, etc). A standardized data extraction form will be used for documenting data for each included trial. This form will be piloted to determine whether any amendments are required. Any disagreements on data extraction will be resolved by discussion between the two reviewers. If the two reviewers are unable to reach a consensus, a third author will serve as arbiter. \nResults will be displayed in tables and discussed in narrative form. We do not plan to do a meta-analysis.\n\n\nANALYSIS OF SUBGROUPS OR SUBSETS\nNA\n\n\n", "uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=a34n7", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "a34n7", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "a34n7", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/t9r2m/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "t9r2m", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/esnyq/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "esnyq", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5df83f7dd28338001ac0ab0d", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/a34n7/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/a34n7/"}}, {"id": "tqy5a", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Drinking ID &amp;

We will also evaluate individuals\u2019 social networks as a key factor related to these changes. Traditional explanations for maturing out of HD emphasize structural changes associated with changes in social networks (e.g., occupational changes, changes in family status; Arnett, 2000).

They must attend the university full time and must be graduating in the next four months. A list of students meeting those criteria will be obtained from the university\u2019s registrar\u2019s office, and students will be approached to participate via email. To qualify for the study, individuals must be HDs; defined here as having scores of 8 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT: Babor et al., 2001). Based on previous studies with similar populations, we anticipate approaching 3000 students to yield a sample of 400: we estimate a 35% response rate to email invitations and that 38% of those individuals will meet HD criteria. To yield a sample of approximately 400 that actually graduate we will recruit approximately 500 participants at baseline (T1). Participants whose college graduation cannot be confirmed following the T2 assessment will be dropped from the study.\n\n\nScreening and Assessments: The initial screening and all assessments will be web-based. The screening will consist of demographic questions and the AUDIT, and respondents who meet the HD inclusion criteria (AUDIT scores of 8 or more) will be routed to the baseline assessment. Following the baseline assessment, subsequent assessments will be completed every 4 months over a 2-year period, yielding a total of 8 assessments. Each assessment will consist of implicit and explicit measures of DI; and self-reported measures of drinking (consumption, risk of alcohol use disorders, and problems), and social networks. The 4-month assessment interval is intended to be long enough to allow for changes in HD, but not so long as to miss meaningful change in overall levels of HD, and is consistent with other prospective studies of HDs in our Center.\n\nPayment: Participants are not paid for screening. Participants who are eligible and complete the baseline (T1) assessment will  receive $25 as compensation. Follow-up assessments will follow similar procedures and will occur every 4 months after the baseline assessment for a two-year period. Participants will be invited to the follow-up sessions by email and will receive reminder emails, phone calls, or texts based on their preferences. Participants will receive $25 for each of the next three follow up assessments they complete. They will also receive a $25 bonus if they complete each of the first 4 assessments in the study. Participants will receive $30 for each of the last 4 follow up assessments they complete. They will receive a $25 bonus if they complete all of those assessments.

(2013b), \u03b1 = .94. \n\nSocial Networks\n--------------------------\nSocial Network Assessment. Social networks will be assessed using a modified version of the Important People Instrument (Longabaugh &amp; Zywiak, 1999), which we have previously used to identify and recruit friends of HD students (Lee et al., 2014; Neighbors et al., 2012). We will also use modifications described in recent research examining social networks and drinking in college students (Barnett et al., 2014). Participants will be asked to list (first name and last initial) up to 10 people who are important to them and whom they interact with in-person on a weekly basis. These people may be friends, family members, people from work, or anyone that they see as having a significant impact on their life, regardless of whether or not they like them. Participants will be asked to report what each network member\u2019s drinking is like with response options ranging from 1 to 4 (1 = \u201ddoesn\u2019t drink at all\u201d, 2 = \u201clight drinker,\u201d 3 = \u201cmoderate drinker,\u201d 4 = \u201cheavy drinker\u201d).

Typical weekly drinking and typical drinks per occasion will be assessed with the DDQ.

The RAPI includes 23 alcohol-related consequences and will be used to assess the frequency of those consequences occurring over the past 4 months (\u03b1 = .92). The AUDIT has 10 questions, which form 3 subscales assessing consumption, dependence, and alcohol-related problems. \n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Drinking Identity\n---------------------------\nImplicit DI: we will use the D1 score  as described in Greenwald et al. ,2003 as a our index of implicit identity\nExplicit DI: we will create a mean score\n\nSocial Network\n---------------------\nSocial Network Drinking: Participants are asked to describe each network member\u2019s alcohol consumption.

We will estimate two models -- one that uses implicit drinking identity as the mediator and one that uses explicit identity as the mediator. We expect our procedures, such as transformations, inference plans, missing data exploration, etc. to be identical across the implicit and explicit identity models. \n\nWe have eight time points. We will construct a latent variable, via confirmatory factor analysis, for Drinking Identity, Social Network, and Hazardous Drinking. Latent hazardous drinking within the social network will be constructed using measures from timepoints 2-3, latent drinking identity will be constructed using IAT measures (when modeling implicit identity) or explicit measures (when modeling explicit identity) from times 4-6, and latent hazardous drinking will be constructed using drinking measures from timepoints 7-8. Each of the latent constructs will be regressed on their respective time 1 (baseline) indicators. Thus, latent variables will represent changes from baseline levels.  \n\nThere will be three primary paths in the mediation model \u2014 a, b, and c. The \u201cc\u201d path will be the direct relationship between the latent social network and latent hazardous drinking and will address Hypothesis 2 \u2014 we expect a positive coefficient. The \u201cb\u201d path will be the direct relationship between latent identity and latent hazardous drinking and will address Hypothesis 1 \u2014 we expect a positive coefficient.

For example, latent hazardous drinking within the social networks will represent the stable portion of drinking within the social network at times 2 and 3. The latent variables will be identified by fixing the variance of each latent variable to 1 and estimating the factor loadings. Hazardous drinking in the social network only has two indicators (i.e., time 2 and time 3).

They must attend the university full time and must be graduating in the next four months. A list of students meeting those criteria will be obtained from the university\u2019s registrar\u2019s office, and students will be approached to participate via email. To qualify for the study, individuals must be HDs; defined here as having scores of 8 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT: Babor et al., 2001). Based on previous studies with similar populations, we anticipate approaching 3000 students to yield a sample of 400: we estimate a 35% response rate to email invitations and that 38% of those individuals will meet HD criteria. To yield a sample of approximately 400 that actually graduate we will recruit approximately 500 participants at baseline (T1). Participants whose college graduation cannot be confirmed following the T2 assessment will be dropped from the study.\n\n\nScreening and Assessments: The initial screening and all assessments will be web-based. The screening will consist of demographic questions and the AUDIT, and respondents who meet the HD inclusion criteria (AUDIT scores of 8 or more) will be routed to the baseline assessment. Following the baseline assessment, subsequent assessments will be completed every 4 months over a 2-year period, yielding a total of 8 assessments. Each assessment will consist of implicit and explicit measures of DI; and self-reported measures of drinking (consumption, risk of alcohol use disorders, and problems), and social networks. The 4-month assessment interval is intended to be long enough to allow for changes in HD, but not so long as to miss meaningful change in overall levels of HD, and is consistent with other prospective studies of HDs in our Center.\n\nPayment: Participants are not paid for screening. Participants who are eligible and complete the baseline (T1) assessment will  receive $25 as compensation. Follow-up assessments will follow similar procedures and will occur every 4 months after the baseline assessment for a two-year period. Participants will be invited to the follow-up sessions by email and will receive reminder emails, phone calls, or texts based on their preferences. Participants will receive $25 for each of the next three follow up assessments they complete. They will also receive a $25 bonus if they complete each of the first 4 assessments in the study. Participants will receive $30 for each of the last 4 follow up assessments they complete. They will receive a $25 bonus if they complete all of those assessments. In addition, at every assessment, participants who complete the assessment will be entered into a drawing for one of 4 $25 gift cards, a strategy which has been used successfully in other longitudinal studies in our Center.\n\n\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Participant gender - covariate\n\nVariables we will measure (please note that each variable described below is measured at each of the 8 study timepoints).\n\nDrinking Identity (2 measures)\n---------------------------------------------------\nImplicit DI will be measured via an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998), specifically the Drinking Identity IAT (Lindgren et al, 2013, Psychology of Addictive Behaviors).\n\nExplicit DI will be measured using the Alcohol Self-Concept Scale (ASCS). The ASCS was adapted from the Smoker Self-Concept Scale (Shadel &amp; Mermelstein, 1996) and used in Lindgren et al. (2013b), \u03b1 = .94. \n\nSocial Networks\n--------------------------\nSocial Network Assessment. Social networks will be assessed using a modified version of the Important People Instrument (Longabaugh &amp; Zywiak, 1999), which we have previously used to identify and recruit friends of HD students (Lee et al., 2014; Neighbors et al., 2012). We will also use modifications described in recent research examining social networks and drinking in college students (Barnett et al., 2014). Participants will be asked to list (first name and last initial) up to 10 people who are important to them and whom they interact with in-person on a weekly basis. These people may be friends, family members, people from work, or anyone that they see as having a significant impact on their life, regardless of whether or not they like them. Participants will be asked to report what each network member\u2019s drinking is like with response options ranging from 1 to 4 (1 = \u201ddoesn\u2019t drink at all\u201d, 2 = \u201clight drinker,\u201d 3 = \u201cmoderate drinker,\u201d 4 = \u201cheavy drinker\u201d). Social network drinking at each time point will be scored as the mean drinking level of network members (range = 1-4). \n\nHazardous Drinking (4 measures)\n------------------------------------------------------\nAlcohol consumption will be assessed with the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ; Collins et al., 1985) . Typical weekly drinking and typical drinks per occasion will be assessed with the DDQ.  Additional item will ask about the # of heavy drinking episodes (4/5 or more drinks per drinking occasions for women/men) in the last month.\n\nAlcohol problems will be measured with the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI: White &amp; Labouvie, 1989) and the AUDIT (Babor et al., 2001). The RAPI includes 23 alcohol-related consequences and will be used to assess the frequency of those consequences occurring over the past 4 months (\u03b1 = .92).

We will estimate two models -- one that uses implicit drinking identity as the mediator and one that uses explicit identity as the mediator. We expect our procedures, such as transformations, inference plans, missing data exploration, etc. to be identical across the implicit and explicit identity models. \n\nWe have eight time points. We will construct a latent variable, via confirmatory factor analysis, for Drinking Identity, Social Network, and Hazardous Drinking. Latent hazardous drinking within the social network will be constructed using measures from timepoints 2-3, latent drinking identity will be constructed using IAT measures (when modeling implicit identity) or explicit measures (when modeling explicit identity) from times 4-6, and latent hazardous drinking will be constructed using drinking measures from timepoints 7-8. Each of the latent constructs will be regressed on their respective time 1 (baseline) indicators. Thus, latent variables will represent changes from baseline levels.  \n\nThere will be three primary paths in the mediation model \u2014 a, b, and c. The \u201cc\u201d path will be the direct relationship between the latent social network and latent hazardous drinking and will address Hypothesis 2 \u2014 we expect a positive coefficient. The \u201cb\u201d path will be the direct relationship between latent identity and latent hazardous drinking and will address Hypothesis 1 \u2014 we expect a positive coefficient. The \u201ca\u201d path will be the direct relationship between latent social network and latent identity.

For example, latent hazardous drinking within the social networks will represent the stable portion of drinking within the social network at times 2 and 3. The latent variables will be identified by fixing the variance of each latent variable to 1 and estimating the factor loadings. Hazardous drinking in the social network only has two indicators (i.e., time 2 and time 3).
