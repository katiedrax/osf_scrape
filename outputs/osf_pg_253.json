The first is: are one or multiple language control mechanism(s) responsible for lexical retrieval and phonetic production? To address this, reaction times, voice onset time (VOT), and vowel formants will be examined in Spanish-English bilinguals. Reaction time is used as a measure of lexical retrieval difficulty, while VOT and vowel formants are used as a measure of accentedness.

In other words, increased difficulty in language selection will result in both slower reaction times and more accented productions \u2013 i.e. more English-like VOT and vowel quality in Spanish targets and more Spanish-like VOT and vowel quality in English targets.

For instance, increased difficulty in language selection could result in slower reaction times, but not an increase in accentedness. \n\nWith regards to the second question, we expect for cognates to be retrieve more quickly than non-cognates and for cognates to be more accented than non-cognates, regardless of context.

These pronouns are used to express 3 person categories (and their number alternations): 1SG, 1PL, 2SG, 2PL, 3SG and 3PL. \nTwo of these pronominal meaning share a single form (i.e. they are are homophonous), and the other two are distinct (depending on the Condition, as specified previously). Participants are tested on how well they have learned the mapping between forms and meanings. The dependent variable for the first phase of the experiment will then be accuracy rates: a binary response variable indicating whether the form chosen for a given meaning is CORRECT or INCORRECT, according to the language they were trained on.  \n\nIn Phase 2, participants are taught two distinct locative forms, which correspond to two of the three person categories (relevant to the speaker, the addressee, or other(s)). They must then apply one of the two forms they have learned to the remaining category by selecting between the two options. We will analyse which one of the two taught forms participants use for each person category during testing. For trained forms, this will give us accuracy scores indicating whether the form chosen for a given meaning is CORRECT or INCORRECT, according to the language they were trained on. For a given condition, there are two bipartitions compatible with the training, one of these is always a participant bipartition. Responses for the held-out category will necessarily match one of these two possible bipartitions. We will quantify whether responses match or not the participant bipartition (which basically means using the same form for spaces in the vicinity of the speaker and the addressee).\n\n \n\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We will use logistic mixed-effects regression models to analyse the results.\nWe aim to test whether participants generalize the partition they learned for personal pronouns to locatives. Therefore, we specifically compare conditions that differ on the pronoun system participants are exposed to but not on the locative phase.\n\n- Condition 1 vs. Condition 2: In Condition 1, participants are trained on an author bipartition for personal pronouns. In Condition 2 participants are trained on a participant bipartition. If the person system participants are trained on influences their behaviour wrt locatives, we expect the rate of responses consistent with a participant bipartition to be higher in Condition 2 than in Condition 1. \n\n- Condition 3 vs. Condition 4: In Condition 3 participants are trained on a participant bipartition for personal pronouns.  In Condition 4, they are trained on a random bipartition (1+3). \nIn Condition 3, we expect participants to consistently derive a participant partition in locatives as well. In Condition 4, if participants are expected to derive a similar random locative partition. However, based on previous results (Maldonado &amp; Culbertson, submitted) and a small pilot, we expect the random pronoun partition to be more difficult to learn. Therefore, its influence on locative extrapolation may be less pronounced. Participants may instead derive an author partition (native language bias), may exhibit some other bias, or may simply be inconsistent. We therefore expect more variability in Condition 4 than in Condition 3, leading to an effect of Condition.  \n\nWe will run two models, which only differ in the subset of data analysed: Model A will be run on data from Conditions 1 and 2, and Model B will be run on data from Conditions 3 and 4. \n\nBoth Model A and B will test the effect of Condition on the response for the held-out category. This response variable is categorical: coded as 1 or 0 depending on whether it matches or not the participant bipartition on trials involving the held-out (untrained) spatial meaning. Our predictor is Condition (2 levels for each model).  We will also include random by-participant intercepts. We will use a treatment contrast coding scheme with baseline on Conditions 2 (Model A) and Condition 3 (Model B) respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []},
