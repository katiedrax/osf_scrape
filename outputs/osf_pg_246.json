This can be viewed in terms of work tasks given to an employee, and whether they choose to engage in them immediately or push away for future engagement, thus procrastinating. Previous research has shown mixed results regarding individuals perceptions of construal levels and procrastination. Cultural values and background can also impact an employees view of time. Dimensional models of culture, such as that of Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1998), indicate that time is seen as more flexible in collectivist vs individualist cultures, and this may influence how individuals approach their work tasks.
