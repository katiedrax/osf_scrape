Mitchell et al. (2005), for example, conducted a meta-analysis and found a small but significant effect of racial bias on juror decisions. In another meta-analysis, Sweeney and Haney (1992) found that white mock-jurors give significantly longer sentences to white defendants than to black ones. Archival studies have also found that black defendants have higher conviction rates than white ones, that they tend to receive harsher sentences, and that they are more likely to be sentenced to death. Further, in a mock-juror study, Wuensch et al. (2002) found that jurors favored defendants of their ingroup, particularly when victims were members of an outgroup. In his 2009 dissertation, Lytle also found that individuals display implicit bias against black defendants and that this bias reliably predicts conviction decisions.\n\nHowever, some studies have found evidence contradicting these findings. In a review of past empirical research, Pfeifer (1990) came to the conclusion that there is little evidence supporting the existence of jurors\u2019 racial bias and that many studies misinterpreted data leading to a false understanding of the state of bias. In another example, Elek and Agor (2014) failed to replicate past findings concerning racial bias and attributed this fact to jurors\u2019 \u201cspontaneous self-correction\u201d in light of society\u2019s recently egalitarian norms. Some have cited this kind of self-correction as a reason for these null effects, particularly in cases where race is salient. Shaw and Skolnick (1995) found in their study that there was an anti-White bias, which deliberation generally eliminated. Another theory suggests that studies which failed to find juror biases bear the mark of social dominance dynamics which obscure the racism at play. \n\nThere have been two empirical studies on the topic of jury instructions aimed at bias reduction, Ingriselli (2014) and Elek and Agor (2014). Outside of these studies, which most directly address the topic at hand, there have been a number of studies concerning jury instructions, more generally. \n\nIngriselli (2014)\n\nIngriselli\u2019s 2014 empirical study considered jury instructions as a potential method of mitigating juror bias and did so within the context of a number of theories on the origins of juror bias. The first theory with which the article contended was aversive racism theory, which holds that juror racism is generally unconscious and is thus driven by implicit biases. It argues that jurors generally want to adhere to their explicitly egalitarian beliefs and suggests, as a consequence, that when race is salient in the process of jury decision-making, jurors will be forced to access their egalitarian beliefs and will self-correct into a state of reduced bias. The other racial bias theory that Ingriselli considered is the social identity theory which claims that, in order to achieve a state of high self-esteem, individuals will seek to elevate their ingroup in comparison to other outgroups. Under this theory, if individuals seek to increase their self-esteem and their circumstances highlight an opportunity to reduce the status of an outgroup member, they will take that opportunity. Finally, the researchers considered the race-neutral theory that any emphasis on procedural justice--that is, the fairness of the justice system\u2014will reduce juror bias by legitimizing the jury decision-making process. \n\nIn order to consider these theories, the study manipulated four independent variables in a 4 (instruction type: egalitarian, self-affirming, procedural, control) x 2 (race salience: high, low) x 2 (instruction timing: pre-evidence, post-evidence) x 3 (racism: non-racist, aversive racist, true racist) between-subjects study. The first variable was the type of instructions which researchers presented to mock jurors. Jurors encountered one of four instruction conditions. First, they could have seen egalitarian instructions (see Appendix A), meant to reduce bias through a form of implicit racial salience suggested by aversive racism theory. Second, they may have encountered self-affirming jury instructions meant to increase their self-esteem as social identity theory suggests. Third, they read a set of instructions highlighting procedural justice. Fourth, in the control condition, they saw only reasonable doubt instructions present in all conditions. The next variable that Ingriselli manipulated was racial salience. In the high racial salience condition participants saw a picture of the black defendant and a bystander in the case description mentioned race; in the low salience condition, participants saw no photo and the bystander merely complained about rising crime rates. Researchers were also interested in considering the timing of jury instructions and so they either presented the instructions before or after the evidence. Finally, the researchers categorized participants into three categories based on their implicit bias (measured through an IAT) and their explicit bias (measured through the Modern Racism Scale). Participants were either non-racists, aversive racists (high implicit, low explicit bias), or true racists. \n\nResearchers launched the study on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Participants saw a case description and balanced pieces of evidence either before or after jury instructions and the study then asked them to report their verdict (across seven different measures, e.g. level of guilt and recommended sentence). Finally, participants completed the two bias measures. \n\nThe study concluded that non-racists were significantly less biased than true racists and found that black defendants were less likely to be found guilty (according to one measure) if instructions were provided pre-evidence. The study found no support for either social identity theory or an emphasis on procedural justice as effective debiasing tactics. However, there was a three-way interaction between instruction type, instruction timing, and race salience, such that participants gave longer sentences to black defendants when there was low racial salience, when they heard their jury instructions pre-evidence, and when that instruction was egalitarian.  This suggests partial support for aversive racism theory as all the evidence does accord with the theory but it should not have been necessary for all three of these variables to coincide in order to see a reduction in bias. \n\nIt is important to note a number of key shortcomings in the design of this study, however. First, the study was conducted on MTurk online and thus may not be particularly ecologically valid. In addition, the study did not have a white defendant as a control and thus treated increased punitiveness as equivalent to racial bias without evidence that the same trends would not have occurred were the defendant white. Further, in order to categorize participants by their level of bias, research excluded 75 people from their original 412- person sample because they displayed high explicit bias and low implicit bias, which researchers found implausible. In another example of a statistical improbability, half of all participants showed a reverse bias on their IAT such that they scored anti-white. Finally, the researchers found that their study was already \u201cunderpowered\u201d and then proceeded to conduct a series of exploratory analyses which removed another sizeable section of their study population.\n\nElek and Agor (2014)\n\nElek and Agor (2014) conducted another study concerning the possibility of mitigating juror bias through the use of specialized implicit bias instructions. The study had a 2 (defendant race: black, white) x 2 (victim race: black, white) x 2 (instruction type: specialized, control) factorial design. Researchers conducted the study online, using a representative sample which they obtained through ResearchNow. Participants encountered a two-part study, which researchers presented as two separate studies administered weeks apart. In part one, participants first had to answer jury eligibility questions and then saw a video of a man in judges\u2019 robes presenting one of two sets of instructions. All mock-jurors heard standard pattern instructions on reasonable doubt and assault cases, but those not in the control condition also saw a specialized jury instruction loosely based off the instructions which Judge Mark Bennett has been using in his court (See Appendix for both Bennett\u2019s instructions and Elek and Agor\u2019s instructions). Participants then read one of the case descriptions adapted from Sommers and Ellsworth (2000, 2001) describing an assault case in a college locker room. Researchers manipulated both the race of the defendant (black or white) and the race of the victim (black or white). After the mock-jurors read the facts of the case they answered a number of verdict related questions (e.g. certainty in guilt, sentencing). In part two of the study, participants completed an IAT and a number of explicit bias measures (a measure of warmth toward people of different races, the Symbolic Racism Scale, and the Internal and External Motivation to Respond without Prejudice scales). \nDespite the fact that 86% of their sample displayed an implicit preference for white people, Elek and Agor did not find any evidence of bias in juror decision-making, failing to replicate past studies. They did find that greater IAT bias predicted increased conviction rates, but this did not vary by race. Further, researchers did not find any effects for defendant race. This lack of a baseline level of bias made it difficult for researchers to find whether jury instructions affected bias. The only pattern they found with regard to jury instructions was that the defense case was strongest in the control condition when there was a black victim and a black defendant; this effect was mitigated by specialized bias instructions. The study also did not find that the instructions had any backlash or backfire effects; that is, participants did not display more bias after having heard the instructions.\nResearchers explained their failure to replicate largely by hypothesizing that participants engaged in spontaneous self-correction of their biases, given that any minor differences in study design have existed across other studies which have not failed to replicate Sommers and Ellsworth. The study could likely have benefited from a more ecologically valid design as researchers conducted the study on the internet. Further, the population of black mock-jurors was too small to conduct follow up research on their biases. \n\nThis study would be the first RCT to study the effect of de-biasing jury instructions at all and would specifically test it on actual juries, rather than mock juries."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "If a de-biasing instruction affects implicit bias, then individual juror scores on the IAT will show a reduction in bias from test 1 to test 2 for those that received the instruction as compared to that that did not."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

impacts on the levels of responsive parenting.  Therefore, the present study will aim to address how parent and child factors have a differential predictive value on parental responsiveness. \n\nParental responsivity has implications for the social, cognitive, emotional, and linguistic development of children.  By identifying the factors that affect parental responsiveness, prevention and intervention programs can be designed to target the specific forces that affect responsiveness.  In addition, this research will help provide a better understanding of the factors that affect the responsivity of parents who have children with developmental delays.  This is an important demographic to examine, as children with developmental delays may require enhanced responsiveness from parents to ensure that their needs are being met.  \n\nThe present study will be completed through a secondary data analysis, using baseline data collected from the KEEP-P study, which was conducted at the Oregon Social Learning Centre.  The University of Oregon Ethics Board approved the KEEP-P study and the present study. The goal of the KEEP-P study was to encourage the development of positive parenting strategies amongst families caring for children with developmental delays through a 12-week, manualized, evidence-based, group intervention program.  \n\nResearch Question: In a sample of children with developmental delays, what are the predictors of responsive parenting, including both parental and child factors?

The PICCOLO is a 29-item questionnaire that examines positive parenting behaviours through parent-child interactions (Roggman, Cook, Innocenti, Jump Norman, &amp; Christiansen, 2009).  This measure can be used to examine parent-child interactions with children ages 10 months to 47 months (Goodlett et al., 2017). The items on the PICCOLO are grouped into four domains, known as responsiveness, encouragement, teaching, and affection.  There are seven items within the responsiveness domain, including items such as, \u201cPays attention to what child is doing.\u201d  Responsiveness refers to the degree to which parents are aware of their child\u2019s needs and respond accordingly to them.  Next, there are seven items within the encouragement domain, which examines how parents scaffold their child\u2019s attempts at independence, imaginative play, and exploring the world.  Items within this domain include, \u201cVerbally encourages child\u2019s efforts.\u201d  There are eight items within the teaching domain, such as, \u201cExplains reasons for something to child.\u201d  Teaching involves conversing with one\u2019s child, in addition to playing together, providing a cognitively enriching environment, and describing things.  Finally, there are seven items within the affection domain.  One example of this domain includes, \u201cUses positive expressions with child.\u201d  Affection refers to the positive expression of emotion through words and actions towards one\u2019s child.  The intensity and frequency of parent behaviours are rated on a 3-point scale, with 0 referring to \u201cnot at all there,\u201d and 2 referring to \u201cmostly there.\u201d  Interactions between parent and child are recorded for approximately 10 minutes, and then coded by research assistants (Vilaseca et al., 2019b). Researchers have demonstrated that the PICCOLO has good validity and reliability for members of various ethnic groups in the United States.  Studies have also indicated good predictive and construct validity for this measure.  The first PICCOLO was shown to have a .91 Cronbach\u2019s Alpha, .77 interrater reliability, and .78 internal consistency (Roggman, Cook, Innocenti, Norman, &amp; Christiansen, 2013).\n\nParental stress and adverse childhood experiences will be the parental independent variables examined in the present study.  Parental stress will be measured using the Parenting Stress Index: Short Form. The Parenting Stress Index: Short Form (PSI: SF) is a measure designed to assess the level of stress experienced by individuals as a result of parenting (Lee, Gopalan, &amp; Harrington, 2016).  This measure was developed in 1995 by Abidin and is used for parents with children under the age of 12.  The PSI: SF is composed of 36 items, which are equally divided into three subscales, known as Parental Distress, Difficult Child, and Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction.  The Parental Distress subscale, which includes items such as, \u201cThere are quite a few things that bother me about my life,\u201d measures the distress individuals feel in their parenting role, in addition to how parental responsibilities may be limiting their opportunities.  The degree to which a child\u2019s abilities and temperament frustrate a parent is examined by the Difficult Child subscale, which includes items like, \u201cIt takes a long time and it is very hard for this child to get used to new things.\u201d  The Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction subscale, which includes items such as, \u201cThis child reacts very strongly when something happens that he/she doesn\u2019t like,\u201d examines the parent\u2019s perception of negative child reactions during interactions with one another.  Of the 36 items on the PSF: SF, 33 items are scored on a 5-point scale, with 1 referring to \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d and 5 referring to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d  Three of the items on the PSI: SF have different response options for the 5-point Likert scale.  Item 22 has response options, from 1 to 5, of \u201cnot very good at being a parent,\u201d \u201ca person who has some trouble being a parent,\u201d \u201can average parent,\u201d \u201ca better than average parent,\u201d and \u201ca very good parent.\u201d  Item 32 has response options, from 1 to 5, as \u201cmuch harder than expected,\u201d \u201csomewhat harder than expected,\u201d \u201cabout as hard as expected,\u201d \u201csomewhat easier than expected,\u201d and \u201cmuch easier than expected.\u201d  Item 33 has response options, from 1 to 5, as \u201c10+,\u201d \u201c8\u20139,\u201d \u201c6\u20137,\u201d \u201c4\u20135,\u201d and \u201c1\u20133.\u201d  A total score may be obtained by adding up the three subscale scores.  Lower parental stress is indicated by a lower total score.  Internal reliability consistency, as indicated by Cronbach\u2019s alpha, was determined to be .91 for the PSI: SF (Abidin, 1995).  In addition, Abidin found the Cronbach\u2019s alpha to be .80 for the Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction subscale, .85 for the Difficult Child subscale, and .87 for the Parental Distress subscale.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are another parental independent variable to be examined in this study. ACEs will be measured using the ACEs Questionnaire. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire assesses the degree to which individuals were exposed to ACEs from birth to the age of 18 (Dube et al., 2003).  There are three variables examined in the ACE Questionnaire, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction.  The abuse variables included physical abuse, psychological abuse, and contact sexual abuse.  Questions were modified from the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) to create the physical psychological abuse categories (Strauss, 1979).  Participants respond to questions modified from the CTS by selecting, \u201cnever,\u201d \u201conce or twice,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d  For psychological abuse, responses of \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d are considered as exposure to emotional abuse (Dube et al., 2003).  Exposure to physical abuse is defined by responses of \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d  An example of a question from this category includes, \u201cDid a parent or other adult in the household often or very often hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Psychological abuse is defined by two questions, such as \u201cDid a parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at, insult, or put you down?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Four questions from Wyatt (1985) were modified to create the contact sexual abuse category, such as, \u201cDid an adult or person at least 5 years older ever have you touch their body in a sexual way?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Participants may answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to any of the four questions from Wyatt.  Selecting the response \u201cyes\u201d is coded as exposure to contact sexual abuse.  Neglect variables include physical and emotional neglect.  Researchers modified items from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 1994) to develop items for the neglect variables.  Participants respond using a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 representing \u201cnever true\u201d and 5 representing \u201cvery often true.\u201d  Items are reverse scored if need be.  Physical neglect includes five questions, such as \u201cI didn't have enough to eat.\u201d  Two questions are reverse scored in this category.  Scores from these five questions are added together to reveal a total score.  Exposure to physical neglect is defined by a score of 10 or more.  Emotional neglect includes five questions, such as \u201cThere was someone in my family who helped me feel important or special.\u201d  After reverse scoring all five questions, scores are added together.  Exposure to emotional neglect is defined by a score of 15 or more.  The household dysfunction variables include four categories, such as violence against the mother, criminal behaviour in the household, substance abuse, and mental illness.  The category of violence against the mother was developed using four questions from the CTS (Strauss, 1979).  Violence against the mother is defined by a response of \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d to the first two questions, or if the participant selected any other response than \u201cnever\u201d to the last two questions.  One example of a question includes, \u201cWas your mother (or stepmother) ever repeatedly hit over at least a few minutes?\u201d  Next, exposure to criminal behaviour in the household is defined by answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cDid a household member go to prison?\u201d  Participants are considered as having experienced exposure to substance abuse if they answer \u201cyes\u201d to either of the two questions asked in this category, such as, \u201cLive with anyone who used street drugs?\u201d (Schoenborn, 1991).  Exposure to mental illness is indicated by answering \u201cyes\u201d to either of the two questions in this category, including, \u201cWas a household member depressed or mentally ill?\u201d Dube, Williamson, Thompson, Felitti, and Anda (2004) found the test-retest reliability kappa coefficients range from .56 to .72 for domestic violence, and physical and psychological abuse for the ACEs Questionnaire, and from .46 to .86 for items with dichotomous response options. \n\nChild behaviour will be the child independent variable examined in the present study.  Child behaviour will be examined through the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ: SE) assesses the parent\u2019s perceptions of their child\u2019s social and emotional development (Squires, Bricker, &amp; Twombly, 2002).  This questionnaire includes items relevant to emotional and social development, including communication, autonomy, interactions with people, compliance, self-regulation, affect, and adaptive behaviour.  Five versions of this questionnaire were used in this study, with each version corresponding to a particular age range, including 21-26 months, 27-32 months, 33-41 months, 42-53 months, and 54-65 months.  Parents filled out the version that corresponded to their child\u2019s age.  The number of items increases with each version of the questionnaire, with the 21-26-month questionnaire having 29 items, and the 54-65-month questionnaire having 36 items.  Most items on the ASQ: SE are scored using a 3-point scale, with 1 referring to \u201cmost of the time,\u201d and 3 referring to \u201crarely or never.\u201d  In addition, parents are asked to circle whether each of these 25 items is a concern (1) or not a concern (2).  Three questions ask parents to provide open-ended written responses.  One question is both a Likert-scale question and an open-ended free response question.  After questionnaires are completed, scores are converted to denominations of 0, 5, and 10.  Child social and emotional problems are indicated by high scores on this measure (Heo &amp; Squires, 2012).  The internal consistency was found to be at an alpha of .82 in a study by Squires, Bricker, Heo, and Twombly (2001) assessing the ASQ: SE.  In addition, the test-retest reliability was found to be .94, while specificity ranged from .82 to .96, and sensitivity was found as a range from .75 to .89.\n\nThe Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was also used to assess child behaviour.  The CBCL asks parents to describe their child\u2019s behavioural and emotional problems on a 103-item questionnaire (Achenbach, 1992).  Of these items, 99 items are Likert style questions in which parents are asked to think about whether the item either currently, or within the past two months, reflects their child\u2019s behaviours.  Parents respond by circling one of three response options, with 2 representing \u201cvery true or often true\u201d and 0 reflecting \u201cnot true\u201d of the child\u2019s behaviour.  Four additional items ask parents to respond by writing about their children.  There are five scales in the CBCL that correspond to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), including Pervasive Developmental Problems, Anxiety Problems, Affective Problems, Oppositional Defiant Problems, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems.  An additional seven Syndrome scales are included in the CBCL, which include Anxious/Depressed, Sleep Problems, Emotionally Reactive, Aggressive Behavior, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, and Attention Problems.  A Total Problems score is calculated from the scales, in addition to scores reflecting Externalizing Problems and Internalizing Problems.  Myers (2013) found coefficient alpha reliabilities that were calculated for the DSM scales (.63 to .86), the Syndrome scales (.66 to .92), and the Total Problems score (.95).  Researchers also calculated test-rest reliability for these three scores, which indicated that values of .74 to .87 for the DSM scales, .68 to .92 for the Syndrome scales, and .85 for the Total Problems score.  \n\nSociodemographic co-variates will include child age, household income, and child gender.

Therefore, the present study will aim to address how parent and child factors have a differential predictive value on parental responsiveness. \n\nParental responsivity has implications for the social, cognitive, emotional, and linguistic development of children.  By identifying the factors that affect parental responsiveness, prevention and intervention programs can be designed to target the specific forces that affect responsiveness.  In addition, this research will help provide a better understanding of the factors that affect the responsivity of parents who have children with developmental delays.  This is an important demographic to examine, as children with developmental delays may require enhanced responsiveness from parents to ensure that their needs are being met.  \n\nThe present study will be completed through a secondary data analysis, using baseline data collected from the KEEP-P study, which was conducted at the Oregon Social Learning Centre.  The University of Oregon Ethics Board approved the KEEP-P study and the present study. The goal of the KEEP-P study was to encourage the development of positive parenting strategies amongst families caring for children with developmental delays through a 12-week, manualized, evidence-based, group intervention program.  \n\nResearch Question: In a sample of children with developmental delays, what are the predictors of responsive parenting, including both parental and child factors?

Mother-child dyads participated in this study.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "Not applicable. ", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "The dependent variable in the current study is responsive parenting, which will be measured using the Parenting Interactions with Children: Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes (PICCOLO). The PICCOLO is a 29-item questionnaire that examines positive parenting behaviours through parent-child interactions (Roggman, Cook, Innocenti, Jump Norman, &amp; Christiansen, 2009).  This measure can be used to examine parent-child interactions with children ages 10 months to 47 months (Goodlett et al., 2017). The items on the PICCOLO are grouped into four domains, known as responsiveness, encouragement, teaching, and affection.  There are seven items within the responsiveness domain, including items such as, \u201cPays attention to what child is doing.\u201d  Responsiveness refers to the degree to which parents are aware of their child\u2019s needs and respond accordingly to them.  Next, there are seven items within the encouragement domain, which examines how parents scaffold their child\u2019s attempts at independence, imaginative play, and exploring the world.  Items within this domain include, \u201cVerbally encourages child\u2019s efforts.\u201d  There are eight items within the teaching domain, such as, \u201cExplains reasons for something to child.\u201d  Teaching involves conversing with one\u2019s child, in addition to playing together, providing a cognitively enriching environment, and describing things.  Finally, there are seven items within the affection domain.  One example of this domain includes, \u201cUses positive expressions with child.\u201d  Affection refers to the positive expression of emotion through words and actions towards one\u2019s child.  The intensity and frequency of parent behaviours are rated on a 3-point scale, with 0 referring to \u201cnot at all there,\u201d and 2 referring to \u201cmostly there.\u201d  Interactions between parent and child are recorded for approximately 10 minutes, and then coded by research assistants (Vilaseca et al., 2019b). Researchers have demonstrated that the PICCOLO has good validity and reliability for members of various ethnic groups in the United States.  Studies have also indicated good predictive and construct validity for this measure.  The first PICCOLO was shown to have a .91 Cronbach\u2019s Alpha, .77 interrater reliability, and .78 internal consistency (Roggman, Cook, Innocenti, Norman, &amp; Christiansen, 2013).\n\nParental stress and adverse childhood experiences will be the parental independent variables examined in the present study.  Parental stress will be measured using the Parenting Stress Index: Short Form. The Parenting Stress Index: Short Form (PSI: SF) is a measure designed to assess the level of stress experienced by individuals as a result of parenting (Lee, Gopalan, &amp; Harrington, 2016).  This measure was developed in 1995 by Abidin and is used for parents with children under the age of 12.  The PSI: SF is composed of 36 items, which are equally divided into three subscales, known as Parental Distress, Difficult Child, and Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction.  The Parental Distress subscale, which includes items such as, \u201cThere are quite a few things that bother me about my life,\u201d measures the distress individuals feel in their parenting role, in addition to how parental responsibilities may be limiting their opportunities.  The degree to which a child\u2019s abilities and temperament frustrate a parent is examined by the Difficult Child subscale, which includes items like, \u201cIt takes a long time and it is very hard for this child to get used to new things.\u201d  The Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction subscale, which includes items such as, \u201cThis child reacts very strongly when something happens that he/she doesn\u2019t like,\u201d examines the parent\u2019s perception of negative child reactions during interactions with one another.  Of the 36 items on the PSF: SF, 33 items are scored on a 5-point scale, with 1 referring to \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d and 5 referring to \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d  Three of the items on the PSI: SF have different response options for the 5-point Likert scale.  Item 22 has response options, from 1 to 5, of \u201cnot very good at being a parent,\u201d \u201ca person who has some trouble being a parent,\u201d \u201can average parent,\u201d \u201ca better than average parent,\u201d and \u201ca very good parent.\u201d  Item 32 has response options, from 1 to 5, as \u201cmuch harder than expected,\u201d \u201csomewhat harder than expected,\u201d \u201cabout as hard as expected,\u201d \u201csomewhat easier than expected,\u201d and \u201cmuch easier than expected.\u201d  Item 33 has response options, from 1 to 5, as \u201c10+,\u201d \u201c8\u20139,\u201d \u201c6\u20137,\u201d \u201c4\u20135,\u201d and \u201c1\u20133.\u201d  A total score may be obtained by adding up the three subscale scores.  Lower parental stress is indicated by a lower total score.  Internal reliability consistency, as indicated by Cronbach\u2019s alpha, was determined to be .91 for the PSI: SF (Abidin, 1995).  In addition, Abidin found the Cronbach\u2019s alpha to be .80 for the Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction subscale, .85 for the Difficult Child subscale, and .87 for the Parental Distress subscale.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are another parental independent variable to be examined in this study. ACEs will be measured using the ACEs Questionnaire. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Questionnaire assesses the degree to which individuals were exposed to ACEs from birth to the age of 18 (Dube et al., 2003).  There are three variables examined in the ACE Questionnaire, including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction.  The abuse variables included physical abuse, psychological abuse, and contact sexual abuse.  Questions were modified from the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) to create the physical psychological abuse categories (Strauss, 1979).  Participants respond to questions modified from the CTS by selecting, \u201cnever,\u201d \u201conce or twice,\u201d \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d  For psychological abuse, responses of \u201coften\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d are considered as exposure to emotional abuse (Dube et al., 2003).  Exposure to physical abuse is defined by responses of \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often.\u201d  An example of a question from this category includes, \u201cDid a parent or other adult in the household often or very often hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Psychological abuse is defined by two questions, such as \u201cDid a parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at, insult, or put you down?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Four questions from Wyatt (1985) were modified to create the contact sexual abuse category, such as, \u201cDid an adult or person at least 5 years older ever have you touch their body in a sexual way?\u201d (Felitti et al., 1998).  Participants may answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to any of the four questions from Wyatt.  Selecting the response \u201cyes\u201d is coded as exposure to contact sexual abuse.  Neglect variables include physical and emotional neglect.  Researchers modified items from the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 1994) to develop items for the neglect variables.  Participants respond using a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 representing \u201cnever true\u201d and 5 representing \u201cvery often true.\u201d  Items are reverse scored if need be.  Physical neglect includes five questions, such as \u201cI didn't have enough to eat.\u201d  Two questions are reverse scored in this category.  Scores from these five questions are added together to reveal a total score.  Exposure to physical neglect is defined by a score of 10 or more.  Emotional neglect includes five questions, such as \u201cThere was someone in my family who helped me feel important or special.\u201d  After reverse scoring all five questions, scores are added together.  Exposure to emotional neglect is defined by a score of 15 or more.  The household dysfunction variables include four categories, such as violence against the mother, criminal behaviour in the household, substance abuse, and mental illness.  The category of violence against the mother was developed using four questions from the CTS (Strauss, 1979).  Violence against the mother is defined by a response of \u201csometimes,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201cvery often\u201d to the first two questions, or if the participant selected any other response than \u201cnever\u201d to the last two questions.  One example of a question includes, \u201cWas your mother (or stepmother) ever repeatedly hit over at least a few minutes?\u201d  Next, exposure to criminal behaviour in the household is defined by answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cDid a household member go to prison?\u201d  Participants are considered as having experienced exposure to substance abuse if they answer \u201cyes\u201d to either of the two questions asked in this category, such as, \u201cLive with anyone who used street drugs?\u201d (Schoenborn, 1991).  Exposure to mental illness is indicated by answering \u201cyes\u201d to either of the two questions in this category, including, \u201cWas a household member depressed or mentally ill?\u201d Dube, Williamson, Thompson, Felitti, and Anda (2004) found the test-retest reliability kappa coefficients range from .56 to .72 for domestic violence, and physical and psychological abuse for the ACEs Questionnaire, and from .46 to .86 for items with dichotomous response options. \n\nChild behaviour will be the child independent variable examined in the present study.  Child behaviour will be examined through the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ: SE) assesses the parent\u2019s perceptions of their child\u2019s social and emotional development (Squires, Bricker, &amp; Twombly, 2002).  This questionnaire includes items relevant to emotional and social development, including communication, autonomy, interactions with people, compliance, self-regulation, affect, and adaptive behaviour.  Five versions of this questionnaire were used in this study, with each version corresponding to a particular age range, including 21-26 months, 27-32 months, 33-41 months, 42-53 months, and 54-65 months.  Parents filled out the version that corresponded to their child\u2019s age.  The number of items increases with each version of the questionnaire, with the 21-26-month questionnaire having 29 items, and the 54-65-month questionnaire having 36 items.  Most items on the ASQ: SE are scored using a 3-point scale, with 1 referring to \u201cmost of the time,\u201d and 3 referring to \u201crarely or never.\u201d  In addition, parents are asked to circle whether each of these 25 items is a concern (1) or not a concern (2).  Three questions ask parents to provide open-ended written responses.  One question is both a Likert-scale question and an open-ended free response question.  After questionnaires are completed, scores are converted to denominations of 0, 5, and 10.  Child social and emotional problems are indicated by high scores on this measure (Heo &amp; Squires, 2012).  The internal consistency was found to be at an alpha of .82 in a study by Squires, Bricker, Heo, and Twombly (2001) assessing the ASQ: SE.  In addition, the test-retest reliability was found to be .94, while specificity ranged from .82 to .96, and sensitivity was found as a range from .75 to .89.\n\nThe Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) was also used to assess child behaviour.  The CBCL asks parents to describe their child\u2019s behavioural and emotional problems on a 103-item questionnaire (Achenbach, 1992).  Of these items, 99 items are Likert style questions in which parents are asked to think about whether the item either currently, or within the past two months, reflects their child\u2019s behaviours.  Parents respond by circling one of three response options, with 2 representing \u201cvery true or often true\u201d and 0 reflecting \u201cnot true\u201d of the child\u2019s behaviour.  Four additional items ask parents to respond by writing about their children.  There are five scales in the CBCL that correspond to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), including Pervasive Developmental Problems, Anxiety Problems, Affective Problems, Oppositional Defiant Problems, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems.  An additional seven Syndrome scales are included in the CBCL, which include Anxious/Depressed, Sleep Problems, Emotionally Reactive, Aggressive Behavior, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, and Attention Problems.  A Total Problems score is calculated from the scales, in addition to scores reflecting Externalizing Problems and Internalizing Problems.  Myers (2013) found coefficient alpha reliabilities that were calculated for the DSM scales (.63 to .86), the Syndrome scales (.66 to .92), and the Total Problems score (.95).  Researchers also calculated test-rest reliability for these three scores, which indicated that values of .74 to .87 for the DSM scales, .68 to .92 for the Syndrome scales, and .85 for the Total Problems score.  \n\nSociodemographic co-variates will include child age, household income, and child gender.

online survey experiment in the United States to test social psychology mechanisms of reducing partisan affective polarization that harms democracy (Iyengar et al., 2012; McCoy, Rahman, Somer 2018). This experiment employs two mechanisms previously identified in social psychology to reduce out-group bias to determine if they also reduce the out-party dislike and stereotyping characteristic of partisan affective polarization:  stimulating a sense of common humanity as a superordinate identity (e.g. Motyl et al., 2011), and stimulating perspective-taking (e.g. Simonovits et al., 2018). \nBoth of these approaches have been shown to reduce intergroup prejudice in other settings and thus the goal of this project is to test whether they could be successfully deployed in the context of affective polarization.

In particular, we ask \u201cFor each item, please indicate how well you think it applies to people who vote for the Democratic Party/Republican Party\u201d and present subject with a matrix in which they rate the two targets on the following traits:\nPatriotic\nIntelligent\nOpen minded\nHypocritical\nSelfish\nMean\n\nFor each trait, we provide 5 response options that range from \u201cNot well at all\u201d to \u201cExtremely well\u201d.

Again, we ask about both parties in randomized order). \n\nAgain, for our statistical analysis we recode these measures by (1) taking the absolute difference between the two responses and re-coding these means to range from 0 to 100.\n\nSocial distance\n\nFinally, we ask a series of 5 questions measuring social distance form the outparty. The questions are as follows:\n\nHow comfortable would you feel dating someone from a different political perspective (if you were single)?\nHow comfortable are you doing business with a supporter of the Democrats/Republicans?\nSuppose a son or daughter of yours was getting married. How would you feel if he or she married a supporter of the Democrats/Republicans?\nHow comfortable are you having neighbors on your street who are Democrats/Republicans?\nHow comfortable are you having close personal friends who are Democrats/Republicans? \n\nFor each item, we provide 5 response options that range from \u201cExtremely comfortable\u201d to \u201cExtremely uncomfortable\u201d.  Again, for our statistical analysis we recode these measures by taking the average of these responses and re-coding them to range from 0 to 100.\n\nIntermediate outcomes/Manipulation check\n\nWe theorize that the mechanism by which our treatments reduce out-group bias and threat is through inducing a sense of similarity with members of the out-group.  We will conduct two types of manipulation checks:  a series of questions following the experiments, and a qualitative analysis of the textual answers.\n\nIndex of question responses\n\nCommon Humanity condition: Creating a superordinate identity such as the human identity helps to recategorize out-group members, such that the out-group is now perceived as in-group members of a new superordinate identity category. This  mechanism can reduce bias and increase positive intergroup relations. As Gaertner and Dovidio (2005: 625) note, \u201cif members of different groups are induced to conceive of themselves as a single group rather than as two completely separate groups, attitudes toward former outgroup members will become more positive through the cognitive and motivational forces that result from ingroup formation.\u201d  Even more specifically, priming compassion, or helping behavior, can raise the superordinate identity to the level of common humanity and remind us that suffering is a shared human experience.  Compassion motivates helping behavior to alleviate another\u2019s suffering, to forgive, and reduce punishment (DeSteno, Condon, and Dickens, Leah, 2016).  In our experiment, reading about the suffering of an out-group member because of a child\u2019s grave illness reminds us of our shared humanity.\n\t\nOur manipulation checks thus seek to identify whether respondents prioritize the human category over the partisan identity category.  We create an additive index from the following questions using a 5-point response scale:\nThe political party a person identifies with is less important than the fact that they are a human being, just as I am.\nAt the end of the day most Democrats and Republicans are good people who just want the best for their families.\nI have little in common with people who disagree with me on politics.\n\nPerspective-taking is the process of seeing the world from another\u2019s vantage point; that is, putting oneself in another\u2019s shoes.\u2019 (Galinsky, Ku and Wang 2005). P-30.  Finding similarities with the out-group member  produces empathy and in turn reduces bias and stereotypes of the out-group member, while increasing positive evaluations.  This can happen at both the individual and group levels (Galinsky and Moskowitz, 2000). People who empathize more with the stigmatized group show a more positive attitude towards that group (Pettigrew and Tropp, 2008).  Thus our manipulation checks seek to identify whether people can imagine valid reasons for holding political views antithetical to one\u2019s own, or for changing one\u2019s political views.\n\nPeople can have worthy reasons to change their political views.\nI find it easy to accept that good people might have opposing political viewpoints to mine.\nI find it hard to understand the rationales of Republicans/Democrats on most issues.\n\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "See above"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "Our estimands are sample average treatment effects (SATE) which we estimate through regressions predicting a set of composite dependent measures with two indicators for the two experimental groups relative to the control groups.

This experiment employs two mechanisms previously identified in social psychology to reduce out-group bias to determine if they also reduce the out-party dislike and stereotyping characteristic of partisan affective polarization:  stimulating a sense of common humanity as a superordinate identity (e.g. Motyl et al., 2011), and stimulating perspective-taking (e.g. Simonovits et al., 2018). \nBoth of these approaches have been shown to reduce intergroup prejudice in other settings and thus the goal of this project is to test whether they could be successfully deployed in the context of affective polarization.

For instance, Goldin-Meadow et al. (2008) observed a preference for SOV for extensional, non-reversible events (like \u2018girl covers box\u2019). They called this word order \u2018natural\u2019 and emphasised the key role of SOV order in language evolution. \n\nMore recent experimental work, however, showed that in silent gesture, participants use different word orders depending on the semantic properties of the event they convey information about. In a number of publications, a preference for SVO (alongside other orders, like OSV) was found for reversible events, in which the patient is animate, like in \u2018girl pushes boy\u2019 (Meir et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2014; Gibson et al., 2013). \n\nSilent gesture experiments provide a context where participants are robbed of existing linguistic conventions, and improvise to convey information in a novel way. The word order alternations that arise under these circumstances can help us uncover basic strategies people adhere to when engaged in communication. However, it is important to understand exactly why these word order patterns arise. In the case of the SOV/SVO alternation for reversibility, we need to know what is crucial about reversibility of an action.   \n\nReversibility of an action is often defined as directly related to the participants of that action: reversible actions typically have two animate participants. We aim to investigate a more detailed breakdown of the reversible/non-reversible distinction, by proposing that non-reversible events come in two flavours. Some transitive actions (e.g. \u2018push\u2019 or \u2018stroke\u2019) are non-reversible when the patient is inanimate, but can be made reversible by making the patient animate. However, not all actions are suitable for having two animate participants; for example, if an action like \u2018eat\u2019 or \u2018crumple\u2019 is combined with an animate patient, the resulting event becomes conceptually or physically highly unlikely. This suggests that patient-animacy is not the only important factor in reversibility, but also the properties of the action, and the constraints it places on the properties of its participants.\n\nWe will compare events of the two proposed sub-categories: non-reversible events in the broad sense (e.g. \u2018a woman pushes a box\u2019), and in the strict sense (e.g. \u2018a woman eats an apple\u2019). The former is eligible for becoming reversible when the two participants are animate, and the latter is not likely to occur as a reversible event.\n\nIn a previous study (see preregistration at https://osf.io/unw98 ) in which pairs of participants took turns to communicate about non-reversible and reversible events, we tested the same distinction, and found relatively high proportions of SVO overall, and SOV proportions to be higher in the strict-non-reversible trials, than in both the broad-non-reversible and the reversible trials. In this study, the broad-non-reversible trials were more similar to the reversible trials than the strict-non-reversible trials, i.e., broad-non-reversibles and reversible occurred with the same actions and the same agents, whereas strict-non-reversibles had entirely different agents and actions.\n\nIn the current study, we will make sure that the three kinds of events all have different actions, agents and patients. This will guarantee that the three classes are equally dissimilar, and if we still find a difference between the two non-reversible events, we can be sure it is due to the affordances of the action alone. \n\nAdditionally, in silent gesture experiments that test non-reversible events alone, very high levels of SOV are observed (Goldin-Meadow et al., 2008), whereas overall levels of SOV (even for non-reversible events) are lower in general when non-reversible events are presented alongside reversible events (Hall et al., 2013; Gibson et al., 2013). Hall et al. (2013) investigated the influence of of reversible events on the proportion of SOV for non-reversible events, by testing three conditions: in the first condition, participants first described non-reversible events (of the two kinds described above), and subsequently reversible events. In the second condition, participants saw reversible events first, and subsequently non-reversible events. In the third, reversible and non-reversibles were mixed. Surprisingly, no influence of the position of reversible was found on the proportion of SOV for non-reversibles. This result is in contradiction to our previous study (see brief description above, and preregistration https://osf.io/unw98), in which really high proportions of SVO---and low proportions of SOV---are observed throughout.  \n\nBy creating two conditions, in which the order of presentation of reversible vs non-reversible differs, we aim to find out whether the presence of reversible events influences the word order of subsequent non-reversible trials.\n"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "(1)\tIf the properties of the action (and the constraints these properties place on the participants of the action) have additional explanatory power, on top of patient-animacy, in determining word order variability in silent gesture, we should see a difference between the two event types, strictly-non-reversible events and broadly-defined-non-reversible-events, in the sense that the former behave less like reversible events than the latter.
