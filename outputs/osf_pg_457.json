This represents a type of racial attitudes, usually an attitude held by white Americans toward Black Americans, that is \u201csymbolic\u201d in nature, meaning that it is socialized early in life and is consistent, stable, and dominates other attitudes. This attitude is usually believed to have two components: a commitment to the traditional American work ethic and anti-Black affect. Modern Racism is argued to have replaced older types of racism, often called \u201cold-fashioned racism\u201d, directed towards Blacks. While old-fashioned racism expressed anti-black affect through support for stereotypes about biological inferiority, Modern Racism expresses anti-Black affect through a belief that Blacks violate norms of hard work. Modern Racism is often measured through a set of 4 to 8 standard questions. The most common version comes from Henry and Sears (2000): 1. It\u2019s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites. Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree 2. Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Blacks should do the same. Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree 3. Some say that black leaders have been trying to push too fast. Others feel that they haven\u2019t pushed fast enough. What do you think? Trying to push very much too fast Going too slowly Moving at about the right speed 4. How much of the racial tension that exists in the United States today do you think blacks are responsible for creating? All of it Most Some Not much at all 5. How much discrimination against blacks do you feel there is in the United States today, limiting their chances to get ahead? A lot Some Just a little None at all 6. Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class.

Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree 8. Over the past few years, blacks have gotten more economically than they deserve. Strongly agree Somewhat agree Somewhat disagree Strongly disagree The answers are usually scaled into a single question to measure underlying \u201cracial resentment\u201d. Modern Racism scales have been criticized for conflating \u201cracism\u201d with \u201cprincipled conservatism\u201d (Sniderman and Tetlock 1986) because conservatism could include the belief that individuals are responsible for their own position in life and that government should not intervene to remedy inequality between groups. I propose to test whether the attitudes underlying Modern Racism are rooted in anti-black affect by testing whether respondents will agree with the standard racial resentment statements when the statements are made about groups other than Blacks. I will do this by testing a subset of the questions (the four used by Tesler and Sears (2010)) and substituting other groups, in the place of \u201cBlacks\u201d into the same questions. These groups are whites, \u201cother Americans\u201d, Hispanics, and a series of obscure nationality groups from various parts of the world, such as Nepalese. So, for example, a question could read: \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if Nepalese would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites \u201c If responses to these questions really do represent principled conservatism, and not anti-Black affect, then respondents should be equally likely to agree, regardless of which group is asked about. However, if subjects are equally likely to agree regardless of the group, there are two other possible reasons for this agreement that should also be explored. One reason is a proclivity for \u201cJust World Belief\u201d (Lerner 1980), which is the need to believe that the world is fundamentally just and that people get what they deserve. Another reason could be \u201cethnocentrism\u201d (Kinder and Kam 2009), which would say that white respondents should have a general tendency to attribute negative stereotypes to any outgroup. I have weak priors about these three reasons that resentment could be the same across groups, so I will test all three.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"I will call responses to the standard racial resentment questions \u201canti-Black resentment\u201d and the responses to questions with other groups \u201cnon-standard resentment\u201d.

Subjects will not be pre-screened, but analysis will be limited to white respondents in the United States. They will be asked the standard symbolic racism questions and questions using a non-standard group. The ordering of whether they see the standard or non-standard questions will be randomized. This will allow for both a between subjects and a within subjects tests. Responses to the standard symbolic racism questions will be scaled into a single score, which I will call \u201canti-Black resentment\u201d. Response to questions using other groups besides Blacks will be scaled into a single score called \u201cnon-Standard resentment\u201d. Questions about slavery do not make sense for the other groups, so subjects will only be asked the questions not pertaining to slavery when asked the non-standard questions. When exposed to the standard questions, subjects will be randomly assigned to be asked all four questions or just the three non-slavery questions. The non-standard group will be randomly assigned. After answering the symbolic racism questions, subjects will also be administered the Just World Belief Scale, an ethnocentrism scale (Kinder and Kam 2009), questions about policy choices, and questions about the locations of certain countries on the globe. The following tests will be performed using a T-test for a difference of means (where appropriate). 1. Difference between average anti-Black resentment using three questions and four question standard symbolic racism questions. This will be between subjects because each subject will only see one version. The difference is expected to not be distinguishable from zero and this is necessary to provide legitimacy for the subsequent tests, which all involve tests comparing scales with only three questions. If the difference is zero, all subsequent tests will pool the three and four question versions of the standard symbolic racism questions. 2. Difference between average anti-Black resentment and each non-Standard resentment. This will be tested between subject and within subject. For the between subject test, subjects will be treated as being assigned to whichever condition they were exposed to first. The within subjects difference should be smaller than the between subjects difference, however the within subjects difference may suffer from anchoring or social desirability effects, so the between subjects test should be treated as a more robust test. Average anti-Black resentment will be compared to non-Standard resentment for each group separately (e.g., anti-Black resentment versus anti-Hispanic resentment, anti-Black resentment versus anti-Nepalese resentment, etc.). Because each subject will only see one of many possible non-standard groups, the N for any particular group will be small. I expect there to be no statistically significant difference between these responses. 3. Difference between average response using Black questions and questions about all groups combined. This will be tested between subject and within subject. For the between subject test, subjects will be treated as being assigned to whichever condition they were exposed to first. Resentment across all non-standard groups will be combined and tested against resentment for Blacks. I expect there to be no statistically significant difference between anti-Black resentment and non-standard resentment. 4. I will subset the respondents into self-reported liberals and conservatives and perform the same T-tests just described. Because liberals may have greater social-desirability bias or a belief in social justice that is particularly attuned to the plight of Blacks, I believe they may have lower resentment towards Blacks than non-standard groups. This will mean that the difference between anti-Black resentment and non-standard resentment will be greater for liberals than conservatives, with anti-Black resentment being lower than non-standard resentment for liberals. I will repeat this test using non-self reports of ideology and instead using policy positions that do not include racialized policies. I expect these to follow the same pattern as with self-described ideology. 5. Resentment and \u201cjust world belief\u201d. The difference between Black resentment and non-standard resentment will be negatively correlated with \u201cJust World Belief\u201d. Within subjects, the difference between Black resentment non-standard resentment will be examined for an association with just world belief using a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. This correlation should be negative. Between subjects, this difference cannot be obtained, so responses to each type of question will be tested separately: higher anti-Black resentment will be correlated with just world belief and higher non-standard resentment will also be correlated with just world belief. 6. Resentment and ethnocentrism. The difference between Black resentment and non-standard resentment will be negatively correlated with ethnocentrism. Within subjects, the difference between Black resentment non-standard resentment will be examined for an association with ethnocentrism using a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. This correlation should be negative. Between subjects, this difference cannot be obtained, so responses to each type of question will be tested separately: higher anti-Black resentment will be correlated with ethnocentrism and higher non-standard resentment will also be correlated with ethnocentrism. 7. Knowledge and resentment. I will also ask questions along with the non-Standard resentment questions about on which continent the group in question is found, e.g., if they are asked about \u201cNepalese\u201d, they will be asked a multiple-choice question about on which continent Nepal is located. I will subset respondents into right and wrong answers on these questions. I expect that those who got the question wrong will have higher resentment scores because they will not have pre-existing attitudes on which to draw, but rather will just have to draw on their underlying belief system.\""}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q30": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Influence of Anti-Black Affect in Standard Racial Resentment", "q2": "Ryan Enos", "q3": "20150202AA", "q4": "02/02/2015 - 15:30", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to researcher analysis of outcome data", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "12/30/14", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "", "q15": "\"A long-standing and widely used paradigm for studying racial attitudes in the United States is that of \u201csymbolic racism\u201d, with the related concepts of \u201cmodern racism\u201d or \u201cracial resentment\u201d (Kinder and Sears 1981).

The primary estimand for the first stage of the analysis is the sample average treatment effect of differenced PITI aggregate and component scores over one year or subsequent years depending on how long we can maintain the experimental groups in partnership with IPE and NRDC. We will estimate SATE using randomization inference taking into account our blocking design. Treatment-by-Covariate Heterogeneous Effects. We will estimate heterogeneous effects using multiplicative interaction effects within an OLS regression model, with theoretical justification from Lorentzen, et al. (2014). We are interested in heterogeneous treatment effects across the following covariates: \u2022 pre-treatment PITI score \u2022 pre-treatment measures of city-level civil society mobilization \u2022 pre-treatment large firm dominance \u2022 pre-treatment municipal budget revenues \u2022 pre-treatment environmental quality measures We realize that treatment-by-covariate heterogeneous effects are exploratory in nature because any covariate measure can be confounded. Given our small sample size, we do not expect to be able to test these heterogeneous treatment effects simultaneously. Instead, we test our main heterogeneous treatment effects (pre-treatment PITI score and pre-treatment measures of city-level civil society mobilization) together. We run each of the other covariates separately to explore plausibility. We interpret each with appropriate caution because none is causally identified. However, given the literature (Lorentzen et al. 2014), we feel it is important to offer some test of the observable implications. Intermediate Outcomes. We will estimate SATE for the intermediate outcomes using the same randomization inference procedure in light of our blocking design. To the extent that we find a treatment effect on the intermediate outcomes, we will then complete causal mediation analysis for the main effect in light of these outcomes (Imai et al. 2011). We will be clear to qualify the findings in light of the unmeasured covariates that might confound the mediators. For the measures that can be used as a time series (Weibo data; newspaper data; petition data), we will conduct difference-in-difference time series analysis on a monthly basis. This will allow us to assess the time path of treatment effects. It is possible that attention to pollution and transparency will quickly fade or that the treatment effects on intermediate outcomes will persist. Thus, we will compute average treatment effects at different time periods after the release of the PITI scores by comparing the difference between treatment and control groups for the difference from the pre-treatment measure to the time period under consideration, again using randomization inference. Instrumental Variable Estimation for Regulatory Outcomes. We will use two-stage least squares instrumental variable estimation to test the effects of transparency on regulatory performance and environmental outcomes. As noted, we will conduct a series of placebo tests to justify the exclusion restriction for treatment assignment as an instrument. The most significant threat to the instrumental variable approach is that the disclosure of PITI scores will activate environmental activism, which could have impacts both on the transparency practices and regulatory actions of cities. Thus, in measuring civil society and government pressures for a response to the PITI disclosure, we must carefully consider whether pressure was increased only to improve transparency or whether the PITI disclosure causes more general environmental advocacy. To address this concern, we split our measures of intermediate outcomes and code which promote increased transparency and which promote better environmental practices. To the extent that pressure is only mobilized for increased transparency, then we consider our instrumental variables approach warranted. If the exclusion restriction cannot be maintained, we will complete causal mediation analysis, though admittedly this requires assumptions about the data generation process (Imai et al. 2011). We are also interested in the possibility that the inclusion of new cities in the public PITI release will induce other cities to update their transparency practices and their regulation of pollution. It may be the case that anticipating further transparency requirements, pressures from civil society, and regulatory effort from government in response to perceptions about the likely expansion of PITI in the future, cities in the control condition might react as well. This would dampen the main treatment effect, even though PITI is having an important effect on transparency practices. To investigate whether this is happening, we will complete a time-series analysis on only the control cities to understand whether the disclosure of PITI causes a discontinuous jump in fines and enforcement effort in the control cities, including cities that are not part of our experimental sample. PITI scores have been released in the past, so if anything, our core hypothesis tests are conservative."}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": "Not human subjects research"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/5zu8g/providers/osfstorage/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/5zu8g/providers/osfstorage/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/5zu8g/providers/osfstorage/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/5zu8g/providers/osfstorage/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec"}, "attributes": {"etag": "4b52e14f2a0d73b6571ea890943d548fe59b0f80e2da96a0f30d0ad51c09ec23", "kind": "file", "name": "20150723AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e31df51f6631d00195a2fec", "size": 453036, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "aeba3c7fc661a20796ca6f090298d40b", "sha256": "b8cd373fb5645b8be3294b29abaa5582c270d7842250ca3f26314328ea1bc2dd"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 453036, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:38:57.744359+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "5zu8g", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20150723AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:38:57+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "5zu8g", "sha256": "b8cd373fb5645b8be3294b29abaa5582c270d7842250ca3f26314328ea1bc2dd", "viewUrl": "/project/f2uan/files/osfstorage/5e31df544b2010000e20f44c/", "selectedFileName": "20150723AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20150723AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Government Transparency and the Effectiveness of Environmental Regulation: A Field Experiment in China", "q2": "Sarah Anderson | Mark Buntaine | Mengdi Liu | Baobao Zhang", "q3": "20150723AA", "q4": "08/13/2015 - 18:33", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to assignment of treatment", "q9": "", "q10": "Yes", "q11": "7/27/15", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "The purpose of this research is to offer a strong test of the proposition that transparency by government enhances regulation.

Asking someone to express their probabilistic beliefs quantitatively, especially when those beliefs rest on subjective foundations, is thus like asking a scholar who writes in English to translate her work into Dutch \u2013 she could do it, but she would presumably make mistakes in the process (Zimmer 1994, Wallsten and Budescu 1995). These translation errors could take several forms. Numeric expressions could bias probability assessments, either by shifting the mean of these assessments or by pushing probability estimates away from certainty (that is, further from zero percent or 100 percent). In principle, this should not occur in national security analysis. Using official qualitative lexicons (e.g., so-called \"\"words of estimative probability\"\") requires determining where a probability falls along the number line and then selecting the appropriate term that fits this description. Systematic differences in means among these assessments would indicate that analysts are using these lexicons improperly. But that does not mean one should ignore the possibility. Asking analysts to express their judgments numerically could generate analytic misgivings, or make analysts concerned with how their estimates will be evaluated after the fact. Any such discomfort could bias probability assessments or influence the variance of those assessments. If analysts find it confusing to express subjective judgments quantitatively, then this could add \u201cnoise\u201d to their responses. Any critique that the use of numeric probabilities harms the quality of national security analysis depends on two empirical claims. First, analysts asked to assess probabilities using numbers and words should generate different distributions of responses. Second, the numerical assessments should be less accurate, on average. If analysts simply assign numerical and verbal probabilities interchangeably, with no discernible change in accuracy, then one cannot say that the numerical assessments are any worse from an informational standpoint. Thus the first hypothesis we seek to evaluate is Hypothesis A1: When national security analysts express probabilities using numbers as opposed to words, their estimates will be less accurate, on average. A second issue to consider is whether asking national security analysts to assess numeric probabilities would influence the confidence that they attach to their assessments. In national security analysis, \u201clikelihood\u201d refers to the chances that a judgment is true and \u201cconfidence\u201d reflects the quality of evidence and inferences supporting that judgment. If analysts are uncomfortable expressing numeric probabilities, this could systematically reduce their confidence levels in performing analysis. It is unclear that this would make analyses worse, especially as international relations scholars typically believe that national security analysts tend towards overconfidence (Heuer 1999, Johnson 2004). Nevertheless, there are only grounds for skepticism here if the use of numeric probabilities actually affects analysts\u2019 confidence levels. Thus we explore Hypothesis A2: Numeric expression reduces analysts\u2019 confidence in making probability assessments. **How numeric probability assessment could influence decision making** Concern about how decision makers interpret numeric probabilities also engage issues of bias, variance, and confidence. Because there is rarely an objective way to evaluate the overall quality of national security decisions (Betts 2000), we lay out several hypotheses individually. Hypothesis D1: Numeric probabilities bias decision makers\u2019 support for risky actions. One common worry is that expressing probabilities numerically could make analyses seem more rigorous than they really are. In principle, this could bias the way national security officials evaluate choices under uncertainty. However, the direction of such bias is unclear. For example, if General McChrystal had told President Obama that there was a \u201c60 percent chance\u201d that the Afghan Surge would succeed, would this have made the decision seem more defensible than framing it as an \u201cacceptable risk\u201d? Or would the extra precision have highlighted the residual probability of failure and thus made the President less likely to commit? Without empirical evidence, it is difficult know which of these effects (if either) should be potential concerns. Hypothesis D2: Numeric probabilities influence the strength of dominant tendencies. The impact of expressing numeric probabilities may be conditional on context. Numerical expressions may amplify dominant tendencies, making decision makers more likely to accept policies that appear favorable and less likely to accept policies that appear too risky. Consistent with this view, Dieckmann, Slovic, and Peters (2009) argue that decision makers pay more attention to probabilities when those cues are expressed numerically. However, it is also possible that national security decision makers would be uncomfortable basing decisions on numeric probabilities and that this would attenuate dominant tendencies. Again, we cannot say objectively which of these possibilities would help or harm the quality of decision making. However, if the use of numeric probabilities leaves the strength of dominant tendencies unaffected, this would eliminate another potential grounds for concern. Hypothesis D3: Numeric probabilities reduce decision makers\u2019 willingness to gather additional information. One of the crucial reasons why analysts should distinguish between likelihood and confidence is because this should influence decision makers\u2019 willingness to delay action in order to gather additional information (Friedman and Zeckhauser 2015). Thus another version of the idea that numeric probabilities appear \u201ctoo rigorous\u201d is that this mode of expression may lead decision makers to undervalue conducting additional analysis. This could increase decision makers\u2019 willingness to act immediately, even if it does not alter the way they rank-order policy options. Hypothesis D4: Numeric probabilities increase the variance of decision makers\u2019 views. If decision makers find numeric probabilities to be confusing then, as with analysts, this could add unnecessary \u201cnoise\u201d to their reactions. This would be particularly concerning to proponents of numeric expressions, as one of the main justifications for communicating probabilities precisely is to prevent unnecessary variance in how decision makers respond to information. Hypothesis D5: Numeric probabilities alter decision makers\u2019 confidence in evaluating policy options. If numeric probabilities confuse decision makers, then this could manifest as lower confidence in policy evaluations. If decision makers believe that numeric probabilities are more rigorous than they really are, this could create false confidence in taking action based on ambiguous information. These claims all have real theoretical significance for understanding the psychology of national security decision making, and they also have real practical significance for determining how to assess uncertainty effectively. However, none of these claims has ever been tested directly. We know of no instance where scholars have directly demonstrated the potentially harmful effects of using numerical probabilities in national security analysis and decision making."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "This research involves two original experiments. Experiment 1 asks respondents to assess probabilities. We randomly assign one group of respondents to assess probabilities using \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d and another group of respondents to assess probabilities using numerical percentages. We then examine whether these modes of expression influence the content of what analysts report. Experiment 2 asks respondents to evaluate scenarios that involve making national security decisions under uncertainty. We randomly determine which respondents see this uncertainty described using words versus numbers. We then examine whether quantifying probability assessments changes the way respondents evaluate actions in these scenarios. We will conduct these experiments using Qualtrics surveys administered to students at U.S. War Colleges and to respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). War College students provide an elite sample comprising active-duty U.S. military officers at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel or Colonel. This sample of national security officials provides plausible external validity for our results. The MTurk sample expands our statistical power, while allowing us to test for systematic differences between responses from elite and general samples (Hyde 2015, Renshon 2015). **Experiment 1: Does the Use of Numeric Probabilities Influence Analysis?** Experiment 1 asks respondents to make probability assessments in response to 40 questions about foreign policy and national security. Entries include \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that at least 80 countries currently recognize Taiwan\u2019s independence from China?\u201d and \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that Israel receives more foreign aid than any other country in the world?\u201d These questions span a broad range of topics relating to national security and foreign affairs. We also vary questions across three analytic \u201ctypes.\u201d Thirty questions have factual answers. Five questions involve verifiable predictions (e.g., \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that within the next six months, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will be killed or no longer living in Syria?\u201d). Five questions involve nonverifiable statements about current or previous states of the world (e.g., \u201cIn your opinion, what are the chances that high-ranking members of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence services knew that Osama bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad?\u201d). This distribution of question types allows us to score a large volume of respondents\u2019 predictions, while exploring the possibility that analysts might respond different to these tasks. At the beginning of the survey, we randomly assign respondents to \u201cqualitative\u201d or \u201cquantitative\u201d assessment conditions. Respondents in the quantitative assessment condition convey probability assessments through text-entry of numerical percentages. Respondents in the qualitative assessment condition convey probability assessments by selecting the most appropriate \u201cword of estimative probability\u201d from a commonly-used spectrum with seven, evenly-spaced terms (\u201cremote,\u201d \u201cvery unlikely,\u201d \u201cunlikely,\u201d \u201ceven chance,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cvery likely,\u201d \u201calmost certainly\u201d). We present questions in random order. For the last 10 questions on each survey, we also ask respondents to indicate the level of confidence (7-point scale) they assigned to each assessment. These data allow us to test whether the use of numeric probabilities influences analysis in the manner of the hypotheses articulated above. The \u201cwords of estimative probability\u201d spectrum used in the qualitative expression condition divides the number line into seven equal segments. We will translate integer percentages that respondents submitted in the quantitative expression condition into corresponding qualitative terms. We will then compare the distributions of responses for individual questions and for aggregate data. We will compare the accuracy of these responses using the common Brier scoring method, along with other proper scoring rules. **Experiment 2: Does the Use of Numeric Probabilities Influence Decision Making?** Experiment 2 presents respondents with scenarios involving national security decisions under uncertainty: a proposed hostage rescue mission, a proposed drone strike, and a proposed decision to support local security forces. At the end of each scenario, the survey asks respondents how much they support taking the proposed action immediately (7-point scale), how much they support waiting for additional information before deciding (7-point scale), and how confident they are in making these assessments (7-point scale). We also ask respondents to \u201cwrite a few sentences\u201d justifying their views. Soliciting these text responses allows us to code the integrative complexity of respondents\u2019 reasoning (Baker-Brown et al. 1992), to confirm whether respondents appeared to be taking the survey seriously, and to encourage respondents to consider their views in detail. We randomly assign respondents to qualitative and quantitative expression conditions. In the qualitative expression condition, all probability assessments within scenarios are expressed using \u201cwords of estimative probability.\u201d In the quantitative expression condition, we translate those words into numerical percentages using the probability closest to the middle of the range that each \u201cword of estimative probability\u201d represented that was also a multiple of 0.05. Thus we translate \u201ceven chance\u201d to \u201c50 percent,\u201d we translate \u201clikely\u201d to \u201c65 percent,\u201d and so forth. We randomize the order in which these scenarios appeared. We also randomly present these respondents with one of three versions of each scenario, across which we vary probability assessments. We designed different versions of these scenarios to represent \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cneutral,\u201d or \u201cpessimistic\u201d information about proposed actions. Varying this information is crucial for testing Hypothesis D2 about whether numeric probabilities influence dominant tendencies. Exploring variations in responses across scenario versions also indicates the extent to which respondents\u2019 views actually depended on the information contained in the scenario\u2019s probability assessments. **Additional variables** At the end of each survey, we ask all respondents to complete a three-question adaptive Berlin Numeracy Test (Cokeley et al. 2012). Thus we can examine whether any differences between qualitative/quantitative treatment conditions is influenced by respondents\u2019 numerical fluency. We then ask all respondents to indicate their gender, their race, and whether English was their native language. We also ask MTurk respondents to indicate their year of birth, their education level, and whether they were U.S. citizens.
