attacks, which (almost) all former perpetrators showed. This opens the possibility of police intervention, but in most cases, leaking occurs in the perpetrator's close social environment or online. Hence, leaking is not always easily accessible to the law enforcement agencies, so that the police has to rely on reports of leaking by relatives, friends, or others. It is, therefore, important to investigate which characteristics are considered as important for assessing the seriousness of leaking and the probability of reporting it. It seems that no study has ever examined the assessment of leaking prior to terrorist attacks and the factors which may influence the assessment and the reporting behavior by laypersons and law enforcement personnel. Therefore, we aim at examining the following research questions: \n1. What kind of information do laypersons and law enforcement personnel choose to assess the seriousness of leaking, in order to decide whether to report the behavior or not? \n2.

This opens the possibility of police intervention, but in most cases, leaking occurs in the perpetrator's close social environment or online. Hence, leaking is not always easily accessible to the law enforcement agencies, so that the police has to rely on reports of leaking by relatives, friends, or others. It is, therefore, important to investigate which characteristics are considered as important for assessing the seriousness of leaking and the probability of reporting it. It seems that no study has ever examined the assessment of leaking prior to terrorist attacks and the factors which may influence the assessment and the reporting behavior by laypersons and law enforcement personnel.

The data was from a previous study using the same protocol as outlined here, but with a community sample (Smith et al., 2019). Our previous analyses looked at group differences of infants by higher/lower maternal anxiety by conducting a median split of the GAD-7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lo\u0308we, 2006), a dimensional measure of anxiety. Using dyadic cross-correlation of arousal as the primary outcome measure, we calculated Cohen\u2019s D to be .53. With an alpha of .05, power was calculated at ~70%. This indicates acceptability given the DV\u2019s effect size is anticipated to be higher in the present study, given the greater severity of anxiety in clinical versus community populations. Research increasingly suggests greater anxiety associates with greater synchrony (Beebe et al., 2011; Granat, Gadassi, Gilboa-Schechtman, &amp; Feldman, 2017). \n\nReferences:\n1.

The specific questionnaires are: the Comprehensive Parenting Behaviour Questionnaire (CPBQ; Majdandz\u030cic\u0301, De Vente, &amp; Bo\u0308gels, 2016) the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ; Gartstein &amp; Rothbart, 2003), the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006), the PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001), as well as a non-psychometric family background questionnaire used to gather demographic information. The SCID-V-RV (First et al., 2015) will be used to establish clinical characteristics and categorisations.  \n\nPreprocessing of data from the autonomic reactivity device, measuring actigraphy, body temperature, heart rate monitor and GPS, will be conducted in MATLAB using protocols developed and tested in previous studies (Wass, Porayska-Pomsta, &amp; Johnson, 2011; Wass et al., 2019). Planned analyses will include averaging movement, heart rate data and noise levels to create a single, per-participant average.\n\nWe will conduct cross-correlations to examine the relationship between continuous changes in environmental noise and continuous changes in dyads\u2019 physiological activity. For examples of similar cross-correlation analyses see Smith et al. (2019) and Wass et al. (2019).\n\nAnalyses of the data collected from the microphone will examine the spectral and semantic content of the data recorded. Vocal coding of affect will also be analysed from the audio data. In addition, using MATLAB scripts, the total levels of auditory noise will be calculated, and the auditory complexity of the environment will be examined. An example of a mother and infant data sample is attached.\n\nFor mother-infant interaction episodes, we will analyse data by coding according to the Coding Interactive Behaviour manual (CIB; Feldman, 2003, 2007) and coding schemes used in studies with the same behavioural tasks as in our protocol. Reliability will be determined by calculating the intraclass correlation for ratings made by two coders to approximately 15% of the tapes randomly drawn.\n\nReferences:\n1. Feldman, R. (2003).

The data was from a previous study using the same protocol as outlined here, but with a community sample (Smith et al., 2019). Our previous analyses looked at group differences of infants by higher/lower maternal anxiety by conducting a median split of the GAD-7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lo\u0308we, 2006), a dimensional measure of anxiety. Using dyadic cross-correlation of arousal as the primary outcome measure, we calculated Cohen\u2019s D to be .53. With an alpha of .05, power was calculated at ~70%. This indicates acceptability given the DV\u2019s effect size is anticipated to be higher in the present study, given the greater severity of anxiety in clinical versus community populations. Research increasingly suggests greater anxiety associates with greater synchrony (Beebe et al., 2011; Granat, Gadassi, Gilboa-Schechtman, &amp; Feldman, 2017). \n\nReferences:\n1.

The specific questionnaires are: the Comprehensive Parenting Behaviour Questionnaire (CPBQ; Majdandz\u030cic\u0301, De Vente, &amp; Bo\u0308gels, 2016) the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ; Gartstein &amp; Rothbart, 2003), the GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006), the PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001), as well as a non-psychometric family background questionnaire used to gather demographic information. The SCID-V-RV (First et al., 2015) will be used to establish clinical characteristics and categorisations.  \n\nPreprocessing of data from the autonomic reactivity device, measuring actigraphy, body temperature, heart rate monitor and GPS, will be conducted in MATLAB using protocols developed and tested in previous studies (Wass, Porayska-Pomsta, &amp; Johnson, 2011; Wass et al., 2019). Planned analyses will include averaging movement, heart rate data and noise levels to create a single, per-participant average.\n\nWe will conduct cross-correlations to examine the relationship between continuous changes in environmental noise and continuous changes in dyads\u2019 physiological activity. For examples of similar cross-correlation analyses see Smith et al. (2019) and Wass et al.

In addition, using MATLAB scripts, the total levels of auditory noise will be calculated, and the auditory complexity of the environment will be examined. An example of a mother and infant data sample is attached.\n\nFor mother-infant interaction episodes, we will analyse data by coding according to the Coding Interactive Behaviour manual (CIB; Feldman, 2003, 2007) and coding schemes used in studies with the same behavioural tasks as in our protocol. Reliability will be determined by calculating the intraclass correlation for ratings made by two coders to approximately 15% of the tapes randomly drawn.\n\nReferences:\n1. Feldman, R. (2003).

Despite this, research often emphasises the role of predictability, showing that comprehenders make fast and sophisticated use of knowledge about typical situations to shape their expectations about upcoming words in fine-grained and context-driven ways. This new study contrasts these two dimensions, distinguishing knowledge about situation plausibility from knowledge about what people actually choose to talk about.\n\nThe question is one about modelling: What if an emphasis on event plausibility misses part of the picture? Can models be adapted to simultaneously incorporate expectations for newsworthiness alongside (and related to) expectations for event plausibility? The intuition is that listeners track the plausibility of situations in part to help them guess what a speaker is likely to select as a message worth conveying (e.g., a unicorn is rare but if one appeared, you\u2019d be likely to mention it). The likelihood of mention is thus predicted to rise with the improbability of the situation. Indeed, recent models of the context-dependent meaning of gradable adjectives like 'tall' or 'big' assume that the cost of uttering a (positive form) adjective has to be traded-off against the prior probability of the actual degree (height, size, etc.) of the object in question, thus giving rise to a meaning of, say, 'tall' similar to \u201ctaller than the minimal point where the surprisal of seeing a person that tall licenses that the speaker has not said nothing at all\u201d. Comprehenders in fact do show surprisal for content that is too uninformative if they are expecting novelty, suggesting they are predicting upcoming words based in part on the simple fact that a speaker has chosen the current message as one worth saying out loud. To test if comprehenders use a speaker\u2019s choice to speak in guessing upcoming words, we compare their guesses in a sentence about what a character knows/believes and a sentence about what that the character has said."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "General hypothesis:\nPeople use real-world knowledge to estimate probable situations, and use these guesses to estimate what kind of messages would be worth uttering.\n\nSpecific hypothesis:\nWhen prompted to guess what kind of situation a speaker will describe, participants will more often select a high (i.e. more remarkable) number when the speaker announces something out of the blue compared to when they report something in response to a question."}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

Despite this, research often emphasises the role of predictability, showing that comprehenders make fast and sophisticated use of knowledge about typical situations to shape their expectations about upcoming words in fine-grained and context-driven ways. This new study contrasts these two dimensions, distinguishing knowledge about situation plausibility from knowledge about what people actually choose to talk about.\n\nThe question is one about modelling: What if an emphasis on event plausibility misses part of the picture? Can models be adapted to simultaneously incorporate expectations for newsworthiness alongside (and related to) expectations for event plausibility? The intuition is that listeners track the plausibility of situations in part to help them guess what a speaker is likely to select as a message worth conveying (e.g., a unicorn is rare but if one appeared, you\u2019d be likely to mention it). The likelihood of mention is thus predicted to rise with the improbability of the situation. Indeed, recent models of the context-dependent meaning of gradable adjectives like 'tall' or 'big' assume that the cost of uttering a (positive form) adjective has to be traded-off against the prior probability of the actual degree (height, size, etc.) of the object in question, thus giving rise to a meaning of, say, 'tall' similar to \u201ctaller than the minimal point where the surprisal of seeing a person that tall licenses that the speaker has not said nothing at all\u201d. Comprehenders in fact do show surprisal for content that is too uninformative if they are expecting novelty, suggesting they are predicting upcoming words based in part on the simple fact that a speaker has chosen the current message as one worth saying out loud. To test if comprehenders use a speaker\u2019s choice to speak in guessing upcoming words, we compare their guesses in a sentence about what a character knows/believes and a sentence about what that the character has said.", "q4": "General hypothesis:\nPeople use real-world knowledge to estimate probable situations, and use these guesses to estimate what kind of messages would be worth uttering.\n\nSpecific hypothesis:\nWhen prompted to guess what kind of situation a speaker will describe, participants will more often select a high (i.e. more remarkable) number when the speaker announces something out of the blue compared to when they report something in response to a question.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

We include 35 items in the pre-test.\n\nFor the experiment, we base our 'average' values on the mean of the 'best guess' responses provided in the pre-test. We set the 'high' value to the best guess mean + 1SD. We use the 'maximum' responses to make sure that the best guess mean + 1SD does not result in a value that by far exceeds the (mean) maximum value deemed plausible.\n\nWe will round the average and high values to the nearest round number. We will make an exception when only one of the values (either average or high) for a specific item result in a multiple of 5. In that case, we will round one of the values to the closest other round number to make sure that both values are either a multiple of 5 or not. This exception is based on findings that 'random-seeming' numbers tend to get a more punctual interpretation than numbers that are a multiple of 5 or 10 (e.g., Cummins 2019). Making sure that both the average and the high value for an item seem equally 'punctual' avoids a potential confound of punctual values (versus estimates) seeming more informative (for instance because saying that someone did 17 loads of laundry not only provides information about the number of times someone did laundry, but also implies that the speaker somehow counted/obtained/remembered the exact number).", "q17.uploader": [], "q18.question": "", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "We will analyze participants' responses (average vs. high) using mixed effects logistic regression.\n\nThe predictor variable Speaker Initiative (out of the blue vs. when asked about it) will be dummy coded and centered.
