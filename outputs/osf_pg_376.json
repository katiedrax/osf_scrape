In places where access to rule of law is often a function of a firm\u2019s political connections, how do such considerations affect with whom a firm does business? I explore these dimensions by conducting a survey in Dakar, Senegal amongst a large sample of formal and informal businesses. Within the survey I embed a conjoint experiment and a survey experiment. In the conjoint experiment, respondents choose between two hypothetical deals, with attributes that include informal considerations (e.g., religion, ethnicity, political connections of the firm manager) as well as formal ones (e.g., the type of contract to be used, the size of the other firm). Results will provide evidence for the most important considerations when choosing a business partner, as well as demonstrate how these preferences differ amongst formal and informal firms. The survey experiment will provide evidence on how formal and informal firms differ in their strategies in the case of contract breach when the contract was formal versus informal."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Described and enumerated in fuller detail in the pre-analysis plan, the primary hypotheses of the conjoint experiment are that some of the formal and informal attributes may increase (decrease) the likelihood of accepting the deal, and that some of these considerations may increase (decrease) the perception of risk related with the deal, measured as perception of the probability of contract breach. The other primary hypothesis is that these results differ between formal and informal firms. The secondary hypotheses relate to interactions between attributes as well as interactions with respondent characteristics, and are described in the pre-analysis plan. For example, I expect an interactive effect between the type of contract to be used in the deal and the political connections of the firm manager. Subgroups include the formal status of the firm, the wealth and size of the firm, and covariate matches between the respondent and the hypothetical firm manager (e.g., ethnicity, religion, and political connections)."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "There are four categories of estimations: average marginal component effects (AMCEs), average component interaction effects (ACIEs), as well as conditional AMCEs and ACIEs.

In places where access to rule of law is often a function of a firm\u2019s political connections, how do such considerations affect with whom a firm does business? I explore these dimensions by conducting a survey in Dakar, Senegal amongst a large sample of formal and informal businesses. Within the survey I embed a conjoint experiment and a survey experiment. In the conjoint experiment, respondents choose between two hypothetical deals, with attributes that include informal considerations (e.g., religion, ethnicity, political connections of the firm manager) as well as formal ones (e.g., the type of contract to be used, the size of the other firm). Results will provide evidence for the most important considerations when choosing a business partner, as well as demonstrate how these preferences differ amongst formal and informal firms. The survey experiment will provide evidence on how formal and informal firms differ in their strategies in the case of contract breach when the contract was formal versus informal.", "q16": "Described and enumerated in fuller detail in the pre-analysis plan, the primary hypotheses of the conjoint experiment are that some of the formal and informal attributes may increase (decrease) the likelihood of accepting the deal, and that some of these considerations may increase (decrease) the perception of risk related with the deal, measured as perception of the probability of contract breach. The other primary hypothesis is that these results differ between formal and informal firms. The secondary hypotheses relate to interactions between attributes as well as interactions with respondent characteristics, and are described in the pre-analysis plan. For example, I expect an interactive effect between the type of contract to be used in the deal and the political connections of the firm manager. Subgroups include the formal status of the firm, the wealth and size of the firm, and covariate matches between the respondent and the hypothetical firm manager (e.g., ethnicity, religion, and political connections).", "q17": "There are four categories of estimations: average marginal component effects (AMCEs), average component interaction effects (ACIEs), as well as conditional AMCEs and ACIEs.

[], "value": "Intergroup contact is one of the primary methods of prejudice reduction. Many prejudice reduction interventions use television and radio media programs to engage viewers in \"vicarious intergroup contact\". In vicarious contact, the ingroup member observes another ingroup member interact with an outgroup member. Though the viewer does not directly interact with an outgroup member, the interaction she observes between a fellow ingroup member and the outgroup member provides information to the viewer about what could happen if she interacted with an outgroup member. If the interaction is positive, the viewer should have more positive affect towards the outgroup, similar to direct intergroup contact. Vicarious intergroup contact motivates peacebuilding interventions in violent areas and popular films such as Remember the Titans. It is especially appealing as a prejudice reduction intervention because the quality of the vicarious intergroup contact is controlled. The characters are scripted, so positive contact meeting Allport's four conditions can be ensured: group members interacting (1) cooperatively, for (2) a joint goal, (3) with equal status, and (4) the support of prevailing authorities. However, one potentially vital aspect of intergroup contact has not been explored: the ultimate success or failure of the cooperative contact. Did the cooperation successfully achieve the joint goal, or did the groups fail to achieve their goal? To continue with the example of Remember the Titans, would that intergroup contact have reduced prejudice if the team had lost every game? If contact is only about removing stereotypes, then we might expect that the success or failure of the cooperation will have little to no effect on prejudice reduction. The interaction itself should reshape stereotypes. But if contact is also about a utilitarian expectation of desirable outcomes due to intergroup cooperation, then the success or failure of the cooperation could affect prejudice reduction. A success could lead participants to believe that intergroup cooperation is in their material interest, whereas a failure suggests to them that the groups are better off working alone. This study will expose subjects to vicarious intergroup contact that meets all four of Allport's conditions. One group will see that contact end successfully, and another will see it end unsuccessfully. Everything else about the vicarious contact will remain constant. The groups are Democrats and Republican Trump voters."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "I hypothesize that successful vicarious contact reduces prejudice more than unsuccessful vicarious contact, and that unsuccessful vicarious contact reduces prejudice relative to no vicarious contact.

I expect successful vicarious contact will : (1) Increase affect towards out-partisans on the feeling thermometer scale, reduce negative emotions, and increase positive emotions. I also leave in some more neutral emotions for an exploration. Those emotions are envy, guilty, respectful, hurt, proud, and secure. (2) Reduce threat felt from the out-partisans (3) Reduce stereotypes about out-partisans so that treated subjects report smaller differences between Democrats and Republicans (4) Decrease social distance to out-partisans (5) Reduce infra-humanization of out-partisans (in and out-partisans will be assigned more similar traits) (6) More acceptance of joining a group or living in a community with large percentages of out-partisans (7) More information seeking about political groups aligned with the out-party.

(1) - (3) about the video are only asked to people who watched a video. (4) about abortion is asked to everyone. I expect successful vicarious contact will: (1) Increase perceptions that the characters worked together well. I have no expectations about the other questions. They will be used for exploratory analyses. Exploratory analysis: Subjects use Q-sensors to test physiological activation. I weakly expect that physiological activation will moderate the effect of the video. Subjects with high physiological activation will display greater effects than subjects with low physiological activation. I am also interested to see if subjects in the \"successful\" condition have more or less activation than subjects in the \"unsuccessful\" condition, but I have no expectations about that. Heterogeneous effects: I expect prejudice reduction to be largest for women in this study, since the video shows two female students working together on a class project. I expect larger effects with higher physiological activation. Validity check: For students who watch the videos, to be sure they received the treatment I ask two informational questions. The first is for general video content and asks what the students in the video worked on. The second is about the success of the students' cooperation and asks the grade they receive for their project.

I also measure specific attitudes about the video: (1) relatability of the characters and why, (2) whether or not the characters worked well together and why, (3) whether or not the characters received the grade they deserved, and (4) attitudes about abortion for themselves, Republicans, and Democrats (the characters briefly discuss abortion). (1) - (3) about the video are only asked to people who watched a video. (4) about abortion is asked to everyone. I expect successful vicarious contact will: (1) Increase perceptions that the characters worked together well. I have no expectations about the other questions. They will be used for exploratory analyses. Exploratory analysis: Subjects use Q-sensors to test physiological activation. I weakly expect that physiological activation will moderate the effect of the video. Subjects with high physiological activation will display greater effects than subjects with low physiological activation. I am also interested to see if subjects in the \"successful\" condition have more or less activation than subjects in the \"unsuccessful\" condition, but I have no expectations about that. Heterogeneous effects: I expect prejudice reduction to be largest for women in this study, since the video shows two female students working together on a class project. I expect larger effects with higher physiological activation. Validity check: For students who watch the videos, to be sure they received the treatment I ask two informational questions. The first is for general video content and asks what the students in the video worked on. The second is about the success of the students' cooperation and asks the grade they receive for their project. For a robustness check, the analysis will be conducted with all subjects and after removing subjects who failed the validity check.", "q17": "Lab experiment. Subjects randomly assigned to observe (1) successful intergroup contact, (2) unsuccessful intergroup contact, or (3) no video. Between 100 - 120 students in political science classes are the subjects. Subjects come into a lab one at a time in twenty minute blocks to prevent subject interaction. The study itself takes approximately 30 minutes. Subjects enter the lab, sign-in, read and sign a consent form, place the Q-sensor on their non-dominant hand (if watching the video), and begin the study. Subjects are told they are participating in two studies, the first one about a video and the second about groups in the USA. Once the first study is over, subjects are told they will be randomly assigned questions about one of six group pairs: (1) Muslims and Christians (2) African-Americans and Caucasians (3) the rich and the poor (4) voters and non-voters, (5) Democratic people or Republican people (6) rural people and urban people. All subjects are then asked their experimental condition and told that their condition is assigned questions about Democratic people and Republican people.

Second, I will conduct a survey on several towns that had been exposed to state violence during the days leading to the regional elections.

Other times they chose to stay as separate political entities. Once established, the process of changing borders has generally been uneasy. In fact, separatist conflicts are the main source of violence in today\u2019s world and, of all types of domestic disputes, the ones on self-determination are the most likely to escalate into violence (Walter, 2009). Even though some advanced democratic countries like Canada or the United Kingdom have responded to breakaway demands through either providing policy concessions or holding a self-determination referendum, governments more often resort to state violence in fighting against secessionist movements. This project investigates whether state violence against secessionist movements is effective at appeasing secessionist demands or, by contrast, if state violence backlashes by increasing anger, mistrust toward state institutions, and mobilization against the state in pro-secessionist areas.", "q16": "H1: State violence against secessionism leads to more or less support for secessionist movements H2: State violence against secessionism leads to more or less political participation H3a: If the deterrence effect dominates (less support for secessionist parties and less participation), then people\u2019s emotional reaction to the violent event are likely to be dominated by fear. H3b: If the backlash effect dominates (more support for secessionist parties and more participation), then people\u2019s emotional reaction to the violent events are likely to be dominated by anger.

However, the links between domestic instability and the demand for assertive responses is unclear\u2014while it is argued by policy analysts that authoritarian leaders, including China\u2019s, might feel more pressure to show resolve when domestic dissatisfaction is high, there is no research testing this.

This survey-experiment tests the behavioral bases of these theories posing two related questions: Does domestic dissatisfaction heighten public demand for aggressive responses to foreign provocation? Do aggressive responses to provocation attenuate dissatisfaction with domestic conditions?", "q16": "This research is sited at the confluence of historical work on the importance of anti-foreign spillovers as determinants of regime support in China and IR research focusing on the public opinion determinants of authoritarian foreign policy. Historians have long argued that the fear of seeming weak has been a key constraint on leaders, including Mao (Yahuda 1978, 45-46), and the behavioral bases for this public opinion effect have been supported by recent experimental work (Dafoe and Chen Weiss 2017). However, the links between domestic instability and the demand for assertive responses is unclear\u2014while it is argued by policy analysts that authoritarian leaders, including China\u2019s, might feel more pressure to show resolve when domestic dissatisfaction is high, there is no research testing this. Similarly, a corollary expectation of this line of argument, that assertive international behavior can lessen the public\u2019s dissatisfaction with domestic issues, remains unexplored.
