Clarity of thinking and appropriateness of inferences may be enhanced through use of language that reflects the issue under consideration. The objectives of this study are to systematically evaluate the extent and nature of causal language use in systematic reviews of observational studies.\nWe will conduct a systematic survey of systematic reviews of observational studies addressing modifiable exposures and their possible impact on patient-important outcomes. We will randomly select 200 reviews published in 2019, stratified in a 1:1 ratio by use and non-use of the GRADE. Teams of two reviewers will independently assess study eligibility and extract data using a standardized data extraction forms, with resolution of disagreement by discussion and, if necessary, by third party adjudication. Through examining the inferences, they make in their papers\u2019 discussion, we will evaluate whether the authors\u2019 intent was to address causation or association. We will summarize the use of causal language in the study title, abstract, study question, and results using descriptive statistics. Finally, we will assess whether the language used use is consistent with the intention of the authors. We will determine if results in reviews that did or did not use GRADE differ.\nOur systematic survey will summarize current practices regarding causal language use in systematic reviews of observational studies. This study is important because the use of language conveys the authors\u2019 intent and clarifies the interpretation and limitations of the study results.

Intentional Binding is an implicit measurement based on time perception for sense of agency - the subjective feeling of control over one\u2019s actions. As we will not collect dopamine samples, we will operationalise dopamine release by the induction of two different emotional states, pleasure and sexual arousal. Moreover, we would like to examine the connection between the dark triad personality traits (psychopathy and narcissism), substance use history and intentional binding. Alteration in intentional binding have been found for narcissism and substance use history in both directions, we would therefore like to distinguish between the two subtypes of narcissism and subtypes of drug use to clarify these results. Psychopathy has previously been linked to hyperactive dopamine activity, but it has not been linked to intentional binding yet.\nIntentional binding is composed of two components: action binding and outcome binding (also tone binding). Action binding is evaluated as a more informative measure of action-outcome association than outcome binding. Outcome binding might depend more on physical characteristics of the outcome because it is more directly associated with sensorimotor prediction, whereas action binding is rather independent (Christensen, Di Costa, Beck, &amp; Haggard, 2019; Wolpe &amp; Rowe, 2014). One can also examine \u201ccomposite\u201d binding as the sum of action binding and outcome binding (Moore et al., 2010; Moore &amp; Obhi, 2012). However, the differences between action and outcome binding indicate that both measures are more informative when considered separately (Wolpe &amp; Rowe, 2014). Action Binding captures a specific impairment in action planning or generating an action outcome prediction, rather than in the matching process of predicted and observed outcomes. This means that alterations in Action Binding reflect the deficits in the dopaminergic system involved in action execution (Tanaka &amp; Kawabata, 2019). Intense emotional states or high arousal might influence the dopaminergic activity and impair the preciseness of prediction processes, concluding, we expect sexual arousal to decrease Action Binding whilst not affecting Outcome Binding"}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tEmotional manipulation: We expect sexual arousal to cause a decrease in action binding whereas pleasure causes an increase intentional binding compared to baseline levels.

Psychopathy has previously been linked to hyperactive dopamine activity, but it has not been linked to intentional binding yet.\nIntentional binding is composed of two components: action binding and outcome binding (also tone binding). Action binding is evaluated as a more informative measure of action-outcome association than outcome binding. Outcome binding might depend more on physical characteristics of the outcome because it is more directly associated with sensorimotor prediction, whereas action binding is rather independent (Christensen, Di Costa, Beck, &amp; Haggard, 2019; Wolpe &amp; Rowe, 2014). One can also examine \u201ccomposite\u201d binding as the sum of action binding and outcome binding (Moore et al., 2010; Moore &amp; Obhi, 2012). However, the differences between action and outcome binding indicate that both measures are more informative when considered separately (Wolpe &amp; Rowe, 2014). Action Binding captures a specific impairment in action planning or generating an action outcome prediction, rather than in the matching process of predicted and observed outcomes. This means that alterations in Action Binding reflect the deficits in the dopaminergic system involved in action execution (Tanaka &amp; Kawabata, 2019). Intense emotional states or high arousal might influence the dopaminergic activity and impair the preciseness of prediction processes, concluding, we expect sexual arousal to decrease Action Binding whilst not affecting Outcome Binding", "q4": "1.\tEmotional manipulation: We expect sexual arousal to cause a decrease in action binding whereas pleasure causes an increase intentional binding compared to baseline levels. There will be no change in the neutral condition in action binding. \n2.\tPersonality: Trait anxiety, vulnerable narcissism and substance use will be linked to a decrease in action binding, whereas grandiose narcissism and psychopathy will be associated to an increase in action binding. \n3.\tSpontaneous Eye blink rates (EBR): The manipulation of sexual arousal will change the EBR dependent on the baseline (low baseline higher EBR, moderate and high baseline lower EBR). EBR will be increased as action binding increases, whereas EBR will be decreased as action binding decreases. \n4.\tPupil dilation: Pupil dilation will increase more in the sexual arousal condition than in the pleasurable condition compared to baselines and will not change from baseline in the neutral condition. Great increases in pupil dilation will be associated with a decrease in action binding, whereas intermediate increases in pupil dilation will be linked to an increase in action binding. \n5.\tHRV and HR: We have no specific hypothesis for the relationship of HRV and HR and action binding. \n6.\tEffects for intentional binding as a sum will be analysed exploratory. \n7.

In the second lap, participants have to either press the space key (action) or hear a tone (consequence) in the baseline conditions. In the agency conditions, key presses and tones are combined with a delay of 250ms. After each trial, participants make time estimations about the events (either key press or tones depending on the condition) on the analogue clock. The interval between key press and tone is perceived shorter than it really is if shown in one trial compared to when presented individually.  \nObjective physiological measurements (heart rate and gsr (emotional response), pupil dilation (arousal) and spontaneous eye blink rates (non-invasive indicator of dopamine activity)) will be measured constantly while participants complete the intentional binding tasks and watch the film clip.
