We will test this possibility using PROCESS Macro for SPSS. \n\nWe also test for evidence of moderation by constructs reflecting epistemic aversion to uncertainty that are thought to be psychological antecedent\u2019s of conservative ideology.

This method has some advantages over the traditional regression models, including sensitivity to non-linear relationships, and testing for a wide range of predictors simultaneously while minimizing overfitting (Strobl, Malley, &amp; Tutz, 2009; Liaw &amp; Wiener, 2015; Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo control for social desirability, affective responses will first be regressed on social desirability. The residuals of this analysis will then be used as the outcome in the random forest model. Afterwards, with the exception of the social desirability, demographic, and sexual arousal items, all items from all the scales employed in this study (148 in total) will be considered as candidate predictors of the residualized responses to the sexual media.\n\nThe data cleaning, and regression analysis will be conducted in SPSS. We will then be using the VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forest) package for R to reduce the candidate predictor variables to a subset of variables that will be used in the final analysis. VSURF operates in three steps: 1) the threshold step, which removes variables that are not related to the outcome; 2) the moderate or interpretation step, which identifies all variables that are important for predicting the response variable (with some redundancy); and 3) the prediction step, which reduces the number of predictors further to lower redundancy in the predictors (Genuer, Poggi, &amp; Tuleau-Malot, 2015).The predictors recommended by the interpretation step will be used to run the final random forest model. Total amount of variance predicted, the mean squared error, and the specific variables that emerged as predictors in their order of strength will then be reported and interpreted (Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo address all three goals of this study, we will retain original and new SOS items for further scrutiny if at least some of them are found to be among the best-predicting items for further scale validation. If all the best predicting items are not from these two sources, it would suggest that the SOS scale does not do what it is intended to do.\n\nProvided that the predictive utility of the original and new SOS items is confirmed, we will conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; maximum likelihood, parallel analysis + interpretability to identify the number of extracted factors; direct oblimin rotation to improve interpretation) on all of old and new SOS items that emerge from the interpretation step of VSURF procedure to examine construct validity. The goals of this EFA will be to: (1) clarify the underlying factor structure of these SOS items; (2) reduce the item pool by retaining only the 5 most highly loading items who\u2019s pattern coefficients exceed .40 for each factor (high cross-loadings will not be used to disqualify items), and (3) identify interpretable factors that are poorly represented by the current item set (factors that are represented by fewer than 5 items that have pattern coefficients &gt;.40). The results of this effort will then be used to guide a confirmatory factor analysis to determine the extent that such a model fits the data using typical cutoffs for fit indices. Additional conceptual dimensions may be identified at this stage if error covariances are needed to ensure acceptable model fit. If needed, a subsequent study may be conducted to validate additional items that may be needed to fill out poorly represented dimensions. If no additional items are needed, subsequent work will seek to confirm the factor structure by replicating the CFA model tested in the current study, establish evidence of convergent / divergent validity of the revised SOS scale and each of its sub-dimensions, and examine measurement invariance to determine the revised SOS represents and assesses the same concept across various groups (e.g. gender, sexual orientation)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q21": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q23": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "A Re-Examination of the Sexual Opinion Survey - Pilot", "q4": "Although the purpose of this study is somewhat exploratory, we do expect to see correlations between affective responses to sexual cues and erotophilia/erotophobia captured by the old SOS items, as well as the other sexuality-reality constructs (e.g., Sociosexuality, Sexual Compulsivity, etc.).

This method has some advantages over the traditional regression models, including sensitivity to non-linear relationships, and testing for a wide range of predictors simultaneously while minimizing overfitting (Strobl, Malley, &amp; Tutz, 2009; Liaw &amp; Wiener, 2015; Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo control for social desirability, affective responses will first be regressed on social desirability. The residuals of this analysis will then be used as the outcome in the random forest model. Afterwards, with the exception of the social desirability, demographic, and sexual arousal items, all items from all the scales employed in this study (148 in total) will be considered as candidate predictors of the residualized responses to the sexual media.\n\nThe data cleaning, and regression analysis will be conducted in SPSS. We will then be using the VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forest) package for R to reduce the candidate predictor variables to a subset of variables that will be used in the final analysis. VSURF operates in three steps: 1) the threshold step, which removes variables that are not related to the outcome; 2) the moderate or interpretation step, which identifies all variables that are important for predicting the response variable (with some redundancy); and 3) the prediction step, which reduces the number of predictors further to lower redundancy in the predictors (Genuer, Poggi, &amp; Tuleau-Malot, 2015).The predictors recommended by the interpretation step will be used to run the final random forest model. Total amount of variance predicted, the mean squared error, and the specific variables that emerged as predictors in their order of strength will then be reported and interpreted (Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo address all three goals of this study, we will retain original and new SOS items for further scrutiny if at least some of them are found to be among the best-predicting items for further scale validation. If all the best predicting items are not from these two sources, it would suggest that the SOS scale does not do what it is intended to do.\n\nProvided that the predictive utility of the original and new SOS items is confirmed, we will conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; maximum likelihood, parallel analysis + interpretability to identify the number of extracted factors; direct oblimin rotation to improve interpretation) on all of old and new SOS items that emerge from the interpretation step of VSURF procedure to examine construct validity. The goals of this EFA will be to: (1) clarify the underlying factor structure of these SOS items; (2) reduce the item pool by retaining only the 5 most highly loading items who\u2019s pattern coefficients exceed .40 for each factor (high cross-loadings will not be used to disqualify items), and (3) identify interpretable factors that are poorly represented by the current item set (factors that are represented by fewer than 5 items that have pattern coefficients &gt;.40). The results of this effort will then be used to guide a confirmatory factor analysis to determine the extent that such a model fits the data using typical cutoffs for fit indices. Additional conceptual dimensions may be identified at this stage if error covariances are needed to ensure acceptable model fit. If needed, a subsequent study may be conducted to validate additional items that may be needed to fill out poorly represented dimensions. If no additional items are needed, subsequent work will seek to confirm the factor structure by replicating the CFA model tested in the current study, establish evidence of convergent / divergent validity of the revised SOS scale and each of its sub-dimensions, and examine measurement invariance to determine the revised SOS represents and assesses the same concept across various groups (e.g. gender, sexual orientation)."}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/uds5t/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},

This method has some advantages over the traditional regression models, including sensitivity to non-linear relationships, and testing for a wide range of predictors simultaneously while minimizing overfitting (Strobl, Malley, &amp; Tutz, 2009; Liaw &amp; Wiener, 2015; Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo control for social desirability, affective responses will first be regressed on social desirability. The residuals of this analysis will then be used as the outcome in the random forest model. Afterwards, with the exception of the social desirability, demographic, and sexual arousal items, all items from all the scales employed in this study (148 in total) will be considered as candidate predictors of the residualized responses to the sexual media.\n\nThe data cleaning, and regression analysis will be conducted in SPSS. We will then be using the VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forest) package for R to reduce the candidate predictor variables to a subset of variables that will be used in the final analysis. VSURF operates in three steps: 1) the threshold step, which removes variables that are not related to the outcome; 2) the moderate or interpretation step, which identifies all variables that are important for predicting the response variable (with some redundancy); and 3) the prediction step, which reduces the number of predictors further to lower redundancy in the predictors (Genuer, Poggi, &amp; Tuleau-Malot, 2015).The predictors recommended by the interpretation step will be used to run the final random forest model. Total amount of variance predicted, the mean squared error, and the specific variables that emerged as predictors in their order of strength will then be reported and interpreted (Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo address all three goals of this study, we will retain original and new SOS items for further scrutiny if at least some of them are found to be among the best-predicting items for further scale validation. If all the best predicting items are not from these two sources, it would suggest that the SOS scale does not do what it is intended to do.\n\nProvided that the predictive utility of the original and new SOS items is confirmed, we will conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; maximum likelihood, parallel analysis + interpretability to identify the number of extracted factors; direct oblimin rotation to improve interpretation) on all of old and new SOS items that emerge from the interpretation step of VSURF procedure to examine construct validity. The goals of this EFA will be to: (1) clarify the underlying factor structure of these SOS items; (2) reduce the item pool by retaining only the 5 most highly loading items who\u2019s pattern coefficients exceed .40 for each factor (high cross-loadings will not be used to disqualify items), and (3) identify interpretable factors that are poorly represented by the current item set (factors that are represented by fewer than 5 items that have pattern coefficients &gt;.40). The results of this effort will then be used to guide a confirmatory factor analysis to determine the extent that such a model fits the data using typical cutoffs for fit indices. Additional conceptual dimensions may be identified at this stage if error covariances are needed to ensure acceptable model fit. If needed, a subsequent study may be conducted to validate additional items that may be needed to fill out poorly represented dimensions. If no additional items are needed, subsequent work will seek to confirm the factor structure by replicating the CFA model tested in the current study, establish evidence of convergent / divergent validity of the revised SOS scale and each of its sub-dimensions, and examine measurement invariance to determine the revised SOS represents and assesses the same concept across various groups (e.g. gender, sexual orientation)."}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x3tmy/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},

Participants from the social media platforms will be invited to participate in the study by completing the online survey for the chance of winning a $100 gift card; while undergraduate students from the university's research participation pool will be granted 0.5 credit for their participation. \nIndividuals interested in joining the study must be at least 18 years of age, be able to read and respond to questions posed in English, and reside in Canada or the US.\nRecruitment will be taking place between February 2020 - May 2020.", "q17.question": "The outcome variable will be the emotional responses to the 13-item Feelings scale that is asked for the second time after exposure to the sexual media (e.g. \u201cRight now I feel: Sexually aroused\u201d). \nWith the exception of the social desirability, demographic, and sexual arousal items, all items from all the scales employed in this study (148 in total) will be considered as candidate predictors of the residualized responses to the sexual media. \nMeasures Used in the Study:\nSOS items (original and new): The original 21-item SOS (Fisher et al., 1988) (e.g. Masturbation can be an exciting experience.) and the new 58-item SOS (current authors) (e.g. 4.\tReceiving sexually suggestive texts and images from my boyfriend/girlfriend is very sexy.).\nSexual Arousal: A single item measure (e.g. \u201cHow arousing do you find the above picture?\u201d).\nFeelings Scale:13-item Feelings scale (Smeaton, &amp; Byrne, 1998, p. 50) (e.g. \u201cRight now I feel: Sexually aroused\u201d).\nSocial Desirability: 10-item Social desirability scale (Strahan, Gerbasi, 1973) (e.g. \u201cI never resent being asked to return a favor\u201d).\nRevised Sociosexuality Inventory: 9-item Revised Sociosexuality Inventory (Penke &amp; Asendorpf, 2008) (e.g. \u201cSex without love is OK.\u201d).\nSexual Compulsivity Scale: 10-item Sexual Compulsivity Scale (Kalichman &amp; Rompa, 2001) (e.g. \u201cMy sexual appetite has gotten in the way of my relationships\u201d).\nDouble Standard Scale: 10-item Double Standard Scale (Caron, Davis, Halteman, Stickle, 1993) (e.g. \u201cIt is expected that a woman be less sexually experienced than her partner.\u201d).\nSexual Health Survey: 4-item Sexual Health Survey (Eastman-Muller, Carr &amp; Osterlind, 2006) will be assessed using of its knowledge subscale (e.g. \u201cWomen can become pregnant the first time they engage in vaginal-penile intercourse.\u201d).\nMeasure of Sexual Identity Exploration and Commitment (Worthington, Navarro, Savoy &amp; Hampton, 2008) will be captured using 6 items of the commitment subscale (e.g. \u201cI know what my preferences are for expressing myself sexually.\u201d) and 2 items sexual orientation (e.g. \u201cMy sexual orientation is clear to me.\u201d). \nBrief Sensation Seeking Scale: 8-item Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (Hoyle, Stephenson, Palmgreen, Lorch, &amp; Donohew, 2001) (e.g. \u201cI prefer friends who are excitingly unpredictable.\u201d). \nReligiosity: 3-item Religiosity scale (Hill &amp; Hood,1999) (e.g. \u201cHow often do you attend religious services and activities?\u201d).\nConservatism: 7-item Conservatism scale (Henningham, 1996) (e.g. agreeing or disagreeing with \u201cMulticulturalism\u201d). All the items that had sexual connotations (e.g. \u201cGay rights\u201d) were removed from this scale.\n\n", "q17.uploader": [], "q19.question": "To re-examine the validity of the SOS, we will be using a method of machine learning called random forest. This method has some advantages over the traditional regression models, including sensitivity to non-linear relationships, and testing for a wide range of predictors simultaneously while minimizing overfitting (Strobl, Malley, &amp; Tutz, 2009; Liaw &amp; Wiener, 2015; Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo control for social desirability, affective responses will first be regressed on social desirability. The residuals of this analysis will then be used as the outcome in the random forest model. Afterwards, with the exception of the social desirability, demographic, and sexual arousal items, all items from all the scales employed in this study (148 in total) will be considered as candidate predictors of the residualized responses to the sexual media.\n\nThe data cleaning, and regression analysis will be conducted in SPSS. We will then be using the VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forest) package for R to reduce the candidate predictor variables to a subset of variables that will be used in the final analysis. VSURF operates in three steps: 1) the threshold step, which removes variables that are not related to the outcome; 2) the moderate or interpretation step, which identifies all variables that are important for predicting the response variable (with some redundancy); and 3) the prediction step, which reduces the number of predictors further to lower redundancy in the predictors (Genuer, Poggi, &amp; Tuleau-Malot, 2015).The predictors recommended by the interpretation step will be used to run the final random forest model. Total amount of variance predicted, the mean squared error, and the specific variables that emerged as predictors in their order of strength will then be reported and interpreted (Joel, Eastwick &amp; Finkel, 2017).\n\nTo address all three goals of this study, we will retain original and new SOS items for further scrutiny if at least some of them are found to be among the best-predicting items for further scale validation. If all the best predicting items are not from these two sources, it would suggest that the SOS scale does not do what it is intended to do.\n\nProvided that the predictive utility of the original and new SOS items is confirmed, we will conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; maximum likelihood, parallel analysis + interpretability to identify the number of extracted factors; direct oblimin rotation to improve interpretation) on all of old and new SOS items that emerge from the interpretation step of VSURF procedure to examine construct validity. The goals of this EFA will be to: (1) clarify the underlying factor structure of these SOS items; (2) reduce the item pool by retaining only the 5 most highly loading items who\u2019s pattern coefficients exceed .40 for each factor (high cross-loadings will not be used to disqualify items), and (3) identify interpretable factors that are poorly represented by the current item set (factors that are represented by fewer than 5 items that have pattern coefficients &gt;.40). The results of this effort will then be used to guide a confirmatory factor analysis to determine the extent that such a model fits the data using typical cutoffs for fit indices. Additional conceptual dimensions may be identified at this stage if error covariances are needed to ensure acceptable model fit. If needed, a subsequent study may be conducted to validate additional items that may be needed to fill out poorly represented dimensions. If no additional items are needed, subsequent work will seek to confirm the factor structure by replicating the CFA model tested in the current study, establish evidence of convergent / divergent validity of the revised SOS scale and each of its sub-dimensions, and examine measurement invariance to determine the revised SOS represents and assesses the same concept across various groups (e.g. gender, sexual orientation)."}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/frzga/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}},
