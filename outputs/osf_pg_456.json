For example, published results in our field, political science, are much more likely to report p values just below the 0: 05 critical value than just above it (Gerber and Malhotra, 2008a). This could be due to publication practices or to researcher degrees of freedom that allow them to select models that produce significant results. There are discussions inside the discipline, and more broadly in social sciences, about whether the introduction of a registration system like that prevailing in medicine would mitigate these effects, especially effects associated with researcher degrees of freedom. The basic idea is that if researchers precommit to a particular specification then they have less scope to (deliberately or inadvertently) report disproportionately results from analyses that yield significant findings (see for example Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel (2011); Humphreys, de la Sierra, and van der Windt (2013)). Though the arguments for registration are simple and strong, there is surprisingly little evidence that it makes any difference. Do registration requirements really change reporting norms and statistical practices? To contribute evidence to the debate, we seek to assess levels of bias before and after critical registration dates for journals that required and did not require registration. As such, this study aims to provide a systematic assessment of the impact of registration requirements on `critical value' publication bias. The study faces two challenges however. We seek to understand the effects of registration on prospective experimental research yet our own analysis uses observational historical data. The fact that the data is observational makes it difficult to establish causal effects. We focus here on assessing whether patterns of published statistics are less indicative of bias after those journals adopted norms than before. Since the data is historical it is hard to pre-register our analysis in a credible way and to ensure that results we report are truly tests or are themselves shed results. These features generate interpretational difficulties for any results we find. We hope to gain clarity regarding what is learned from our analysis by surveying prior beliefs about publication practices and what we should expect to see if registration did or did not have a causal effect.\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"This project seeks to asses whether medial registration reduced `critical value bias' in ICMJE journals that adopted registration requirements. We define critical value bias as the extent to which the mass of p-values around critical thresholds alpha = .001 and .05 is non-uniform. To examine the effect of this change, we forward the following hypothesis: H1 There is less critical value bias in medical publishing in journals after medical registration requirements were implemented than before they were implemented.\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"We propose two strategies to analyze whether registration reduced bias in the medical sciences. First, building on Gerber and Malhotra (2008), we focus on the distribution of z -statistics around 1.96 (corresponding to the p = 0: 05 threshold) and assess whether the share just above the threshold is lower after 2005 than before 2005 in a set of journals that adopted the registration norm in 2005. Second and more crudely, we implement a `global' test that examines the proportion of all z -statistics that are on either side of z = 3.29 (corresponding to p = 0: 001) and assess whether this proportion is different before and after 2005. We couple these approaches with an analysis of an expert survey that captures beliefs over the effects of registration. The expert survey is comprised of the current editorial board members of ICMJE initially adoptees of registration and a convenience sample of social scientists and other researchers. \""}, "q20":

For example, published results in our field, political science, are much more likely to report p values just below the 0: 05 critical value than just above it (Gerber and Malhotra, 2008a). This could be due to publication practices or to researcher degrees of freedom that allow them to select models that produce significant results. There are discussions inside the discipline, and more broadly in social sciences, about whether the introduction of a registration system like that prevailing in medicine would mitigate these effects, especially effects associated with researcher degrees of freedom. The basic idea is that if researchers precommit to a particular specification then they have less scope to (deliberately or inadvertently) report disproportionately results from analyses that yield significant findings (see for example Casey, Glennerster, and Miguel (2011); Humphreys, de la Sierra, and van der Windt (2013)). Though the arguments for registration are simple and strong, there is surprisingly little evidence that it makes any difference. Do registration requirements really change reporting norms and statistical practices? To contribute evidence to the debate, we seek to assess levels of bias before and after critical registration dates for journals that required and did not require registration. As such, this study aims to provide a systematic assessment of the impact of registration requirements on `critical value' publication bias. The study faces two challenges however. We seek to understand the effects of registration on prospective experimental research yet our own analysis uses observational historical data. The fact that the data is observational makes it difficult to establish causal effects. We focus here on assessing whether patterns of published statistics are less indicative of bias after those journals adopted norms than before. Since the data is historical it is hard to pre-register our analysis in a credible way and to ensure that results we report are truly tests or are themselves shed results. These features generate interpretational difficulties for any results we find. We hope to gain clarity regarding what is learned from our analysis by surveying prior beliefs about publication practices and what we should expect to see if registration did or did not have a causal effect.\"", "q16": "\"This project seeks to asses whether medial registration reduced `critical value bias' in ICMJE journals that adopted registration requirements. We define critical value bias as the extent to which the mass of p-values around critical thresholds alpha = .001 and .05 is non-uniform. To examine the effect of this change, we forward the following hypothesis: H1 There is less critical value bias in medical publishing in journals after medical registration requirements were implemented than before they were implemented.\"", "q17": "\"We propose two strategies to analyze whether registration reduced bias in the medical sciences. First, building on Gerber and Malhotra (2008), we focus on the distribution of z -statistics around 1.96 (corresponding to the p = 0: 05 threshold) and assess whether the share just above the threshold is lower after 2005 than before 2005 in a set of journals that adopted the registration norm in 2005. Second and more crudely, we implement a `global' test that examines the proportion of all z -statistics that are on either side of z = 3.29 (corresponding to p = 0: 001) and assess whether this proportion is different before and after 2005. We couple these approaches with an analysis of an expert survey that captures beliefs over the effects of registration. The expert survey is comprised of the current editorial board members of ICMJE initially adoptees of registration and a convenience sample of social scientists and other researchers. \"", "q18": "",

"\"Three separate experiments were run during the fall 2014 general elections in Dane County and Rock County, Wisconsin to test the effects of a variety of GOTV tools. While this project description is being written up post-election it is prior to the General Accountability Board releasing the November 2014 validated voting lists and prior to any analyses. There are three separate experiments that were run during this election they are described below. #1) Impact of Clarification of Voter ID requirement for Fall, 2014 election. In the run up to the fall election in Wisconsin there was considerable confusion concerning identification requirements for the Fall election. The legislature had passed a law requiring photo identification two years earlier, the Federal District Court had stayed implementation of that law, that decision was reversed at the Appellate Court level in early September, 2014. The Appellate Court said the state should enforce the law; then after several weeks of sending out messages that identification would be required, just a few weeks before the election the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court and reinstituted the stay, meaning no photo identification was required for the fall 2014 election. Given the considerable back and forth over the status of photo identification it would be reasonable to expect that voters would be confused as to what was required to vote. I developed a letter providing a clear and unambiguous message that \u201cNo photo ID is required for the November 2014 election.\u201d The design is relatively simple with a control group receiving no message and the treatment group being split evenly between one group which received this letter from their local County Clerk and the other group which received effectively the same letter from the League of Women Voters. This will allow us to test whether having the information that there is no need to have an ID is more effective if it comes from an official government official who is responsible for elections than if it comes from a non-governmental organization (the LWV). The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups with a control group receiving no mailing. After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. #2) Gratitude Panagopoulos (2010, 2011) has found that gratitude, i.e. thanking people for taking the time out to vote can have a positive effect on voter turnout. I am replicating that study and extending it in a couple of ways. First, because there was a recall election two years into Scott Walker\u2019s term that means there were two gubernatorial elections in the past four years with Walker\u2019s name already on the ballot. From the voter files from Northern Rock County and the portions of Dane County I used I took all voters who had voted in only one of the two gubernatorial elections and randomly divided them into a control group which received the \u201cno photo id\u201d message (only) and a second group that received \u201cno photo id and thank you for voting\u201d messages. This treatment group was further subdivided into receiving the messages from the County Clerk or the League of Women Voters. The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (thank you plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. #3) Guaranteed Privacy Gerber et al. have found that assuring individuals their vote is secret and that no one will ask who you are voting for leads to an increase in turnout among those who are registered but have failed to vote in the past. We retest this in Rock County and Dane County. We identify a set of voters who are registered but have failed to vote. These individuals are then divided into a control group which received the mailer only with information concerning the photo identification rules and a treatment group which received a mailer with the photo identification information and further information assuring their privacy when they vote. The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (your vote is private plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. Treatments: The treatments are delivered in a letter sent out either from the local League of Women Voters (LWV of Dane County or LWV of Rock County) or the local County Clerk (County Clerk in Rock County or Dane County). We specify in advance three treatment conditions: no photo Identification is needed, no photo identification is needed plus thank you for voting, no photo identification is needed plus your privacy is guaranteed. The expectation is all of these will have an effect, but there will be an added effect for the Thank You message and for the population that has not voted previously there will be an added effect for the Privacy Guarantee. Note there is no pure \u201cplacebo\u201d mailer. Normally, I would include a mailer with just a standard civic duty message. That was not done this time because of the interest of the County Clerks. Their help was much appreciated and this served a dual purpose as I was able to run a useful experiment and they were able to get out important information about the upcoming election. They were particularly interested in getting out information on the recent switch in conditions caused by the \u201clast minute\u201d court decision. I would have felt uncomfortable sending out a letter under their name that just generally urged voters to vote WITHOUT including the highly pertinent information that they were not required to bring a photo ID. Therefore no placebo mailer was sent out and the no photo id mailer serves as the closest to a placebo mailer. Randomization Protocol. The list of registered voters is received from the Government Accountability Board in Wisconsin. I stripped out voters who have moved (NCOA listings) and those in housing with greater than 4 registered voters (a desire to avoid apartments with a transient population). . From each address with more than 1 registered voter I randomly chose one individual to be in either the treatment or control group. No household could be represented more than once. After the individual in each household was identified I stratified the sample according to voting propensity. I did not over or under sample from the various strata, but rather randomly pulled the sample for the treatment groups insuring the sample included representative numbers of habitual, and episodic voters\""}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "\"#1) Voters who receive a letter informing them that no photo ID is required in November 2014 will vote at a higher rate than those who do not receive the letter. #2) Those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the Thank you for voting in the past will vote at a higher rate than those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter. #3) For the sample of registered non-voters, those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the \"\"your vote is private\"\" message will vote at a higher rate than those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter. #4) For all of the hypotheses listed above, we predict the notification from an NGO (League of Women Voters) will be just as effective as the notification from an official governmental source (County Clerk).\""}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "\"As the experiment is presently set up we can simply compare the turnout rates across the treatment groups and compare them internally and with the control sample (difference of proportion tests). We will assess the effects of the GOTV mailer on voter turnout.

While this project description is being written up post-election it is prior to the General Accountability Board releasing the November 2014 validated voting lists and prior to any analyses. There are three separate experiments that were run during this election they are described below. #1) Impact of Clarification of Voter ID requirement for Fall, 2014 election. In the run up to the fall election in Wisconsin there was considerable confusion concerning identification requirements for the Fall election. The legislature had passed a law requiring photo identification two years earlier, the Federal District Court had stayed implementation of that law, that decision was reversed at the Appellate Court level in early September, 2014. The Appellate Court said the state should enforce the law; then after several weeks of sending out messages that identification would be required, just a few weeks before the election the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Appellate Court and reinstituted the stay, meaning no photo identification was required for the fall 2014 election. Given the considerable back and forth over the status of photo identification it would be reasonable to expect that voters would be confused as to what was required to vote. I developed a letter providing a clear and unambiguous message that \u201cNo photo ID is required for the November 2014 election.\u201d The design is relatively simple with a control group receiving no message and the treatment group being split evenly between one group which received this letter from their local County Clerk and the other group which received effectively the same letter from the League of Women Voters. This will allow us to test whether having the information that there is no need to have an ID is more effective if it comes from an official government official who is responsible for elections than if it comes from a non-governmental organization (the LWV). The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups with a control group receiving no mailing. After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. #2) Gratitude Panagopoulos (2010, 2011) has found that gratitude, i.e. thanking people for taking the time out to vote can have a positive effect on voter turnout. I am replicating that study and extending it in a couple of ways. First, because there was a recall election two years into Scott Walker\u2019s term that means there were two gubernatorial elections in the past four years with Walker\u2019s name already on the ballot. From the voter files from Northern Rock County and the portions of Dane County I used I took all voters who had voted in only one of the two gubernatorial elections and randomly divided them into a control group which received the \u201cno photo id\u201d message (only) and a second group that received \u201cno photo id and thank you for voting\u201d messages. This treatment group was further subdivided into receiving the messages from the County Clerk or the League of Women Voters. The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (thank you plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. #3) Guaranteed Privacy Gerber et al. have found that assuring individuals their vote is secret and that no one will ask who you are voting for leads to an increase in turnout among those who are registered but have failed to vote in the past. We retest this in Rock County and Dane County. We identify a set of voters who are registered but have failed to vote. These individuals are then divided into a control group which received the mailer only with information concerning the photo identification rules and a treatment group which received a mailer with the photo identification information and further information assuring their privacy when they vote. The primary interest is simply to compare the treatment groups receiving two messages (your vote is private plus no photo id) with the control group receiving the single message (no photo id required). After investigating the bivariate relationship, multivariate tests will be run controlling for vote history, geography, and urbanization. Treatments: The treatments are delivered in a letter sent out either from the local League of Women Voters (LWV of Dane County or LWV of Rock County) or the local County Clerk (County Clerk in Rock County or Dane County). We specify in advance three treatment conditions: no photo Identification is needed, no photo identification is needed plus thank you for voting, no photo identification is needed plus your privacy is guaranteed. The expectation is all of these will have an effect, but there will be an added effect for the Thank You message and for the population that has not voted previously there will be an added effect for the Privacy Guarantee. Note there is no pure \u201cplacebo\u201d mailer. Normally, I would include a mailer with just a standard civic duty message. That was not done this time because of the interest of the County Clerks. Their help was much appreciated and this served a dual purpose as I was able to run a useful experiment and they were able to get out important information about the upcoming election. They were particularly interested in getting out information on the recent switch in conditions caused by the \u201clast minute\u201d court decision. I would have felt uncomfortable sending out a letter under their name that just generally urged voters to vote WITHOUT including the highly pertinent information that they were not required to bring a photo ID. Therefore no placebo mailer was sent out and the no photo id mailer serves as the closest to a placebo mailer. Randomization Protocol. The list of registered voters is received from the Government Accountability Board in Wisconsin. I stripped out voters who have moved (NCOA listings) and those in housing with greater than 4 registered voters (a desire to avoid apartments with a transient population). . From each address with more than 1 registered voter I randomly chose one individual to be in either the treatment or control group. No household could be represented more than once. After the individual in each household was identified I stratified the sample according to voting propensity. I did not over or under sample from the various strata, but rather randomly pulled the sample for the treatment groups insuring the sample included representative numbers of habitual, and episodic voters\"", "q16": "\"#1) Voters who receive a letter informing them that no photo ID is required in November 2014 will vote at a higher rate than those who do not receive the letter. #2) Those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the Thank you for voting in the past will vote at a higher rate than those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter. #3) For the sample of registered non-voters, those who receive the no photo ID message PLUS the \"\"your vote is private\"\" message will vote at a higher rate than those who receive no letter and those who receive the No Photo ID letter. #4) For all of the hypotheses listed above, we predict the notification from an NGO (League of Women Voters) will be just as effective as the notification from an official governmental source (County Clerk).\"", "q17": "\"As the experiment is presently set up we can simply compare the turnout rates across the treatment groups and compare them internally and with the control sample (difference of proportion tests). We will assess the effects of the GOTV mailer on voter turnout. After a set of difference of proportion tests we will use any available pre-treatment covariates to improve precision in a multivariate estimate (probits).

The design and development of the Safe Cities Initiative started in 2013 and has come to completion as of December 2015. The initiative, which aims to reduce the prevalence of intimate partner violence and public violence experienced by women in the urban context includes three interventions: 1) the provision of general support to existing women\u2019s self help groups 2) the provision of general support to existing women\u2019s self help groups with specialized trainings addressing Violence against Women and community action and 3) the creation of new men and boys collectives in slums with trainings addressing lifeskills, gender, and community action. In addition to programme delivery, the Safe Cities Initiative has also been designed to generate robust evidence on what interventions work \u2013 and do not work - to reduce violence against women (VAW). In June 2013, SDDirect was commissioned to lead an independent impact evaluation of the Safe Cities Initiative in partnership with Columbia University in New York and New Concept Information Systems (NCIS) in Delhi.

The sample for the study consists of 250 slums spread across four cities; using a blocked factorial design, slums were randomly selected to receive 1 of 6 possible treatment combinations.

The design and development of the Safe Cities Initiative started in 2013 and has come to completion as of December 2015. The initiative, which aims to reduce the prevalence of intimate partner violence and public violence experienced by women in the urban context includes three interventions: 1) the provision of general support to existing women\u2019s self help groups 2) the provision of general support to existing women\u2019s self help groups with specialized trainings addressing Violence against Women and community action and 3) the creation of new men and boys collectives in slums with trainings addressing lifeskills, gender, and community action. In addition to programme delivery, the Safe Cities Initiative has also been designed to generate robust evidence on what interventions work \u2013 and do not work - to reduce violence against women (VAW). In June 2013, SDDirect was commissioned to lead an independent impact evaluation of the Safe Cities Initiative in partnership with Columbia University in New York and New Concept Information Systems (NCIS) in Delhi.

In order to shed more light on this issue I set out to test the correlation between negativity bias and blame avoidance strategies among future government officials by answering the following questions: How are future government officials affected by negative framing of performance information about public policy initiatives? And are they more inclined to make use of blame avoidance strategies when exposed to negative framing than when exposed to positive framing?

Respondents will also be asked to explain which information they will include in a hypothetical presentation of the performance results in order to detect measures of justification and excuses that is also signs of blame avoidance. By using an open question the answers will be a result of spontaneous process to a much higher degree than if I used closed questions with predefined categories for answers.
