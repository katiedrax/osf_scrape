The current study examines whether psychiatric comorbidity is associated with levels of attrition and amount of effort required for follow-up in a sample of repeat and first-time DUI offenders.

Methods: We attempted to follow-up with 464 first-time and repeat DUI offenders 6-12 months after the baseline wave of a study. At baseline, a subset of 353 of these 464 completed the screener module of the Computerized Assessment and Referral System (CARS; Keating et al., 2019) to screen for psychiatric disorders. These 353 had data available about whether they screened positive for 19 different disorders. For all 464, we recorded the number of days, number of contact attempts, and type of contact methods used to attempt each follow-up interview. For those who did not complete a follow-up, we also recorded the reason a follow-up was not completed. Results: Results will first address the overall amount of contact required to retain our sample. Then, we will determine if there is a difference in follow-up effort and attrition between repeat and first-time DUI offenders. Next, in the subset who completed CARS, we will analyze the relationship between comorbidity (i.e., number and type of positive screens for psychiatric disorders) and attrition and follow-up effort. Finally, we will examine whether different contact methods or timing of contact relate to attrition and efficiency of interview completion.

Next, in the subset who completed CARS, we will analyze the relationship between comorbidity (i.e., number and type of positive screens for psychiatric disorders) and attrition and follow-up effort. Finally, we will examine whether different contact methods or timing of contact relate to attrition and efficiency of interview completion.  Conclusion: We will discuss the implications of these results for future longitudinal studies with challenging populations. \n", "uploader": [{"file_id": "5e98b987f135350541d5689c", "file_name":

For instance, concerning part a) of the hypothesis the dependent variable is students' delay of gratification, the main independent variable is family background and we expect to see a positive and significant coefficient for the latter variable.

On the one hand, we will calculate simple pairwise correlations at the differnt time points and we will check if there is a significant difference in the correlation coefficients. Moreover, we will run OLS regressions in which one of the variables will be the dependent variable and the other will be an independent variable and we will include additional controls, among them time. Moreover, we will have an interaction term involving time and the independent variable of interest. If the coefficient of the interaction term including a dummy denoting the time point when the data was collected and the independent variable turns out to be positive and significant, then it indicates that we cannot reject H1. For instance, concerning part a) of the hypothesis the dependent variable is students' delay of gratification, the main independent variable is family background and we expect to see a positive and significant coefficient for the latter variable. Moreover, if we include dummies for the time points of data collection and interact these dummies with family background, then we expect to see a positive and significant coefficient showing that family background has an additional positive effect on delay of gratification as time passes. \n\nH2: We hypothesize that over time students\u2019 subject-specific comparative academic self-concept (CASC) will increase.\n\nA paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test is suitable to see if H2 holds by comparing subsequent subject-specific CASC values of the participants. We will use also OLS regression where the dependent variable is the subject-specific CASC and among the independent variables we will have dummies for the time when the data was collected and we can see if the coefficients of these dummies is positive and significant and if it is growing in time. If it is the case, then we have convincing evidence that H2 holds.\n\nH3: We hypothesize that over time a) students\u2019 will be less generous to their classmates, and b) the difference between students\u2019 lending behavior between a random classmate and schoolmate will decrease. We hypothesize that a better family background mitigates these effects.\n\nWe can analyze the first part of H3 with the same methods as H2. That is, we will run paired WIlcoxon signed-rank tests and also OLS regressions. For the second part (the effect of family background) we will use the OLS regressions and include the family background variable and we expect to see a negative and significant coefficient.\n\nH4: We hypothesize that students\u2019 baseline ability to delay gratification and better family background will positively affect the willingness to answer the survey.\n\nWe will use linear probability models and logit and probit specifications to see if H4 holds. The willingness to answer the survey will be a binary variable, hence the use of the aforementioned models, ", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecaae5", "text":

place on individualizing vs binding moral foundations. We will collect data in 25 countries (16 European) to allow for a good spread in the endorsement of different moral foundations, and to be able to control for cultural differences, which may also impact a priori perceptions of institutional trustworthiness. We will examine responses to different institutional communication strategies about COVID-19 in terms of compliance with the directives and willingness to display prosocial behaviors. We consider the interplay between individual endorsement of individualizing vs. binding moral foundations, and message framing (appealing to individualizing vs. binding moral foundations) while correcting for cross-national differences (in terms of individualism and collectivism). We further aim to understand whether the fit between individual disposition and the message framing impacts perceived reliability of the message and trustworthiness of the source, and further spills over prosocial attitudes and behaviors related to a number of social issues.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-11T16:03:59.364190", "date_modified": "2020-04-11T15:56:50.031807", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "f1294203b6d5876d5d321d7818126bee9415f17e74ea3bdcb8dca39485aad67f92bf121552b1384e7ae91bc22ec0a470bab6d1a879322397e25eca8d56b5c25f3dd28c4f4dc6cfc08b1a983c45cde382df6c2e5c24907e1ff36d68b7c9a850cb93a26ab463da4070c2433f7597d3e44c0a2a60ae91b4688d1c4663e667a2cc16f4f812b24de68779f9769b4461a103f2", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-11T16:03:59.349884", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF-Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration", "registered_meta": {"looked": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "comments": {"extra": [], "value": "Data collection has just started.

I used partial-eta squared of one-way ANOVA that analyzes the association between content of contact type and perception of the hierarchy as legitimate because the most similar variables are these. First, I pretended that the partial eta-square was like an eta-square since the researchers did not report eta-square. To use this parameter in G-Power, I converted it to \"effect size f\" with using https://www.psychometrica.de/effect_size.html. The value is .3693. Second, because I will run two one-way ANOVA with per one outcome, I divided alpha to two. Third, I choose power as .85. Finally, the required sample size is 82. I repeated this process for MANOVA. Because there are no studies that analyze the association between the same or similar independent and outcomes, I chose an effect size that is between medium, as .06.
