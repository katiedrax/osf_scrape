Importantly, they are foundational in constructing situated representations of our bodies and selves (Cl\u00e9ry &amp; Ben Hamed, 2018; Vignemont &amp; Iannetti, 2015).\n\nRecently, research highlighted the intrinsic link between predictive mechanisms and peripersonal space conceptualisation. In particular, it has been suggested that peripersonal space itself could be defined by those predictive mechanisms that modulate the processing of tactile stimuli on the body when a visual, auditory or audiovisual stimulus is perceived near the body and moving towards it (Cl\u00e9ry &amp; Ben Hamed, 2018; Kandula, Van der Stoep, Hofman, &amp; Dijkerman, 2017; Serino et al., 2018).\n\nIn line with this, a number of studies investigated if tactile spatial attention could be modulated by predictive but not physically proximal stimuli presented in a different modality (Cl\u00e9ry, Guipponi, Odouard, Wardak, &amp; Ben Hamed, 2015; Kandula, Hofman, &amp; Dijkerman, 2015). The key novelty of these studies compared with previous research is their focus on moving visual stimuli that are not colocated nor synchronous with the tactile stimulus, but instead precede, and therefore predict it.\n\nIn the present project, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of these predictive processes, by measuring human adults\u2019 electrophysiological responses to touches which are or are not predictable based on preceding dynamic visual displays. The project will include three studies, one of which is the subject of the present research plan preregistration. In this particular study, we will record and compare somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to touches that have been preceded by approaching or receding dynamic visual information. Approaching visual motion could signal an impending contact between the moving object and the participant\u2019s body, and a corresponding tactile stimulus, while this is not usually the case for receding motion. We will also explore any differences in the anticipatory event related potentials (ERPs) following the presentation of approaching vs receding visual displays, to investigate whether only approaching motion can lead to electrophysiological responses suggesting anticipation of a subsequent tactile stimulus."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "With regards to the processing of the tactile stimulus, we are particularly interested in analysing the early components of the SEPs, those peaking within the first 500 ms following the onset of the tactile stimulus.

The CNV is a slow, negative, fronto-central shift of the potential, which is thought to represent anticipatory activity. We expect that only the visual stimuli that are approaching (not receding from) the body will lead the participant to anticipate/predict a subsequent tactile stimulation.

The participants will take part in this study as well as the other two mentioned above (these other two studies are related to the present study and have its same core structure). The order of the studies will be counterbalanced across participants, with the present study being either the first or the last. The participants will be recruited from a sample of university students and adults who will express interest in taking part in the study and will receive either a monetary compensation for their time or credits from the Research Participation Scheme of the University of Birmingham. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Birmingham, and Informed Consent will be obtained from the participants. The participants will be included in the final sample if: i) they contribute at least 50% artefact free trials, and ii) their accuracy level is at least 80%.\n\nPROCEDURE AND STIMULI\nThe study includes four conditions: approaching visual stimulus followed by touch (Approaching Touch), approaching visual stimulus not followed by touch (Approaching No-Touch), receding visual stimulus followed by touch (Receding Touch) and receding visual stimulus not followed by touch (Receding No-Touch). Each of these conditions will be presented 42 times (168 trials in total). Trials will be presented in groups of 4, within which each condition will be presented in a random order, and grouped in 14 blocks of 3 groups of 4 trials each.\n\nAt the beginning of each block, the participant will be presented with a target face (male or female, counterbalanced across participants irrespective of their own gender) for 5 s to memorise. The participant will then be instructed to hold their hands close to each other and to focus their attention on a fixation cross at the top of the screen throughout the block. The fixation cross will be replaced by a face for 200 ms during the inter-trial intervals (ITIs). The participant will be told that their task is to decide, at the end of each block, whether the target face that they memorised was among those presented during the ITIs and, at the same time, to ignore any other stimuli. The participant will be informed that they are expected to maintain fixation on the fixation cross throughout and that their eyes will be monitored. The ITIs will have a jittered duration between 800 and 1000 ms, inclusive of the 200 ms in which the face is presented. The ITI will be followed by the presentation, at the bottom of the screen, of a small red ball moving either towards the participant\u2019s hands or towards the background. When the ball will move towards the participant\u2019s hands (Approaching conditions), it will simulate, across 10 images and 20 frames (333.3 ms) a motion trajectory from the background towards the participant\u2019s hands, disappearing at the halfway point. More specifically, the ball will reach the halfway point on the 9th frame (after 297 ms) and then it will start disappearing from the 10th frame. When the ball will move towards the background (Receding conditions), it will simulate a motion trajectory from the participant\u2019s hands towards the background, starting at the halfway point. Once the ball will disappear, the participant will receive, on 50% of the trials, a vibrotactile stimulus on both hands, lasting 100 ms. The tactile stimulus will be presented after an interval lasting as long as the motion (297 ms), and therefore at the expected time to contact of the simulated moving ball with the hands in the Approaching condition.\n\nThroughout the study the participant will sit in front of a 21\u201d screen in a dimly lit room. Their hands will be resting next to each other on a small table in front of them and will be positioned about 25.5 cm from the screen and 5 cm below it: this is the location where the simulated moving ball would collide with the hands should it continue its trajectory. The vibrotactile stimulus will be delivered to the participant\u2019s hands via custom-built voice coil tactile stimulators (tactors), driven by a 220 Hz sine wave. One tactor will be placed in each hand and fixed to the participant\u2019s palms with self-adherent bandage. In order to mask the noise of the tactors, white noise will be presented to the participant via earphones.\n\nEEG RECORDING\nThe participants\u2019 electrical brain activity will be continuously recorded using a Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesic Inc.), consisting of 128 silver-silver chloride electrodes evenly distributed across the scalp. The vertex will serve as the reference. The electrical potential will be digitized at 500 Hz sampling rate and stored for off-line analyses (Hoehl &amp; Wahl, 2012).\n\nANALYSES\nThe raw data will be processed offline using NetStation 5.4.2 analysis software (Electrical Geodesic Inc.). Continuous EEG data will be high-pass filtered at 0.03 Hz and low-pass filtered at 30 Hz using digital elliptical filtering (Hoehl &amp; Wahl, 2012). The recordings will then be segmented in epochs, from 800 ms before the tactile stimulus onset until 1200 ms after it and baseline-corrected to the average amplitude of the 100 ms interval preceding the stimulus onset (either the visual or the tactile stimulus, depending on the analyses - see below). Extending to 800 ms prior to the tactile stimulus onset, the epochs will include the presentation of the visual stimulus and the interval between its disappearance and the onset of the tactile stimulus. Channels showing low activity (voltage step smaller than 0.5 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 80 ms), or voltage steps larger than 125 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 20 ms or larger than 200 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 80 ms will be marked as bad. Epochs containing more than 13 bad channels will be rejected, as well as epochs containing eye blinks and eye movements during the presentation of the visual stimulus (600 to 300 ms prior to the tactile stimulus onset). Bad channels (if less than 13) will be interpolated on an epoch-by-epoch basis using spherical interpolation of neighbouring channel values. Artefact free data will then be re-referenced to the average potential over the scalp. Finally, individual and grand averages will be calculated.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "The final sample will include 20 participants.

Bremner", "q3": "Peripersonal space is defined as the portion of space immediately surrounding our body (Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, &amp; Gallese, 1997), and its representations play important roles in our interactions with objects as well as other humans and in contributing to our ability to defend ourselves from impending threats. Importantly, they are foundational in constructing situated representations of our bodies and selves (Cl\u00e9ry &amp; Ben Hamed, 2018; Vignemont &amp; Iannetti, 2015).\n\nRecently, research highlighted the intrinsic link between predictive mechanisms and peripersonal space conceptualisation. In particular, it has been suggested that peripersonal space itself could be defined by those predictive mechanisms that modulate the processing of tactile stimuli on the body when a visual, auditory or audiovisual stimulus is perceived near the body and moving towards it (Cl\u00e9ry &amp; Ben Hamed, 2018; Kandula, Van der Stoep, Hofman, &amp; Dijkerman, 2017; Serino et al., 2018).\n\nIn line with this, a number of studies investigated if tactile spatial attention could be modulated by predictive but not physically proximal stimuli presented in a different modality (Cl\u00e9ry, Guipponi, Odouard, Wardak, &amp; Ben Hamed, 2015; Kandula, Hofman, &amp; Dijkerman, 2015). The key novelty of these studies compared with previous research is their focus on moving visual stimuli that are not colocated nor synchronous with the tactile stimulus, but instead precede, and therefore predict it.\n\nIn the present project, we aim to investigate the neural correlates of these predictive processes, by measuring human adults\u2019 electrophysiological responses to touches which are or are not predictable based on preceding dynamic visual displays. The project will include three studies, one of which is the subject of the present research plan preregistration. In this particular study, we will record and compare somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to touches that have been preceded by approaching or receding dynamic visual information. Approaching visual motion could signal an impending contact between the moving object and the participant\u2019s body, and a corresponding tactile stimulus, while this is not usually the case for receding motion. We will also explore any differences in the anticipatory event related potentials (ERPs) following the presentation of approaching vs receding visual displays, to investigate whether only approaching motion can lead to electrophysiological responses suggesting anticipation of a subsequent tactile stimulus.", "q4": "With regards to the processing of the tactile stimulus, we are particularly interested in analysing the early components of the SEPs, those peaking within the first 500 ms following the onset of the tactile stimulus. We expect to find a difference in the amplitude of the components responding to the tactile stimulus following approaching vs receding visual displays, however we do not have any specific expectations with regards to the direction of the difference.\n\nWith regards to the anticipation of the tactile stimulus, we are particularly interested in the analysis of the modulation of the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) after the presentation of approaching vs receding visual displays. The CNV is a slow, negative, fronto-central shift of the potential, which is thought to represent anticipatory activity. We expect that only the visual stimuli that are approaching (not receding from) the body will lead the participant to anticipate/predict a subsequent tactile stimulation. As a consequence, we expect to find a difference in the amplitude of the CNV following approaching vs receding visual displays. However, we do not have an expectation with regards to the direction of this difference.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

The participants will take part in this study as well as the other two mentioned above (these other two studies are related to the present study and have its same core structure). The order of the studies will be counterbalanced across participants, with the present study being either the first or the last. The participants will be recruited from a sample of university students and adults who will express interest in taking part in the study and will receive either a monetary compensation for their time or credits from the Research Participation Scheme of the University of Birmingham. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Birmingham, and Informed Consent will be obtained from the participants. The participants will be included in the final sample if: i) they contribute at least 50% artefact free trials, and ii) their accuracy level is at least 80%.\n\nPROCEDURE AND STIMULI\nThe study includes four conditions: approaching visual stimulus followed by touch (Approaching Touch), approaching visual stimulus not followed by touch (Approaching No-Touch), receding visual stimulus followed by touch (Receding Touch) and receding visual stimulus not followed by touch (Receding No-Touch). Each of these conditions will be presented 42 times (168 trials in total). Trials will be presented in groups of 4, within which each condition will be presented in a random order, and grouped in 14 blocks of 3 groups of 4 trials each.\n\nAt the beginning of each block, the participant will be presented with a target face (male or female, counterbalanced across participants irrespective of their own gender) for 5 s to memorise. The participant will then be instructed to hold their hands close to each other and to focus their attention on a fixation cross at the top of the screen throughout the block. The fixation cross will be replaced by a face for 200 ms during the inter-trial intervals (ITIs). The participant will be told that their task is to decide, at the end of each block, whether the target face that they memorised was among those presented during the ITIs and, at the same time, to ignore any other stimuli. The participant will be informed that they are expected to maintain fixation on the fixation cross throughout and that their eyes will be monitored. The ITIs will have a jittered duration between 800 and 1000 ms, inclusive of the 200 ms in which the face is presented. The ITI will be followed by the presentation, at the bottom of the screen, of a small red ball moving either towards the participant\u2019s hands or towards the background. When the ball will move towards the participant\u2019s hands (Approaching conditions), it will simulate, across 10 images and 20 frames (333.3 ms) a motion trajectory from the background towards the participant\u2019s hands, disappearing at the halfway point. More specifically, the ball will reach the halfway point on the 9th frame (after 297 ms) and then it will start disappearing from the 10th frame. When the ball will move towards the background (Receding conditions), it will simulate a motion trajectory from the participant\u2019s hands towards the background, starting at the halfway point. Once the ball will disappear, the participant will receive, on 50% of the trials, a vibrotactile stimulus on both hands, lasting 100 ms. The tactile stimulus will be presented after an interval lasting as long as the motion (297 ms), and therefore at the expected time to contact of the simulated moving ball with the hands in the Approaching condition.\n\nThroughout the study the participant will sit in front of a 21\u201d screen in a dimly lit room. Their hands will be resting next to each other on a small table in front of them and will be positioned about 25.5 cm from the screen and 5 cm below it: this is the location where the simulated moving ball would collide with the hands should it continue its trajectory. The vibrotactile stimulus will be delivered to the participant\u2019s hands via custom-built voice coil tactile stimulators (tactors), driven by a 220 Hz sine wave. One tactor will be placed in each hand and fixed to the participant\u2019s palms with self-adherent bandage. In order to mask the noise of the tactors, white noise will be presented to the participant via earphones.\n\nEEG RECORDING\nThe participants\u2019 electrical brain activity will be continuously recorded using a Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesic Inc.), consisting of 128 silver-silver chloride electrodes evenly distributed across the scalp. The vertex will serve as the reference. The electrical potential will be digitized at 500 Hz sampling rate and stored for off-line analyses (Hoehl &amp; Wahl, 2012).\n\nANALYSES\nThe raw data will be processed offline using NetStation 5.4.2 analysis software (Electrical Geodesic Inc.). Continuous EEG data will be high-pass filtered at 0.03 Hz and low-pass filtered at 30 Hz using digital elliptical filtering (Hoehl &amp; Wahl, 2012). The recordings will then be segmented in epochs, from 800 ms before the tactile stimulus onset until 1200 ms after it and baseline-corrected to the average amplitude of the 100 ms interval preceding the stimulus onset (either the visual or the tactile stimulus, depending on the analyses - see below). Extending to 800 ms prior to the tactile stimulus onset, the epochs will include the presentation of the visual stimulus and the interval between its disappearance and the onset of the tactile stimulus. Channels showing low activity (voltage step smaller than 0.5 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 80 ms), or voltage steps larger than 125 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 20 ms or larger than 200 \u03bcV within a sliding window of 80 ms will be marked as bad. Epochs containing more than 13 bad channels will be rejected, as well as epochs containing eye blinks and eye movements during the presentation of the visual stimulus (600 to 300 ms prior to the tactile stimulus onset). Bad channels (if less than 13) will be interpolated on an epoch-by-epoch basis using spherical interpolation of neighbouring channel values. Artefact free data will then be re-referenced to the average potential over the scalp. Finally, individual and grand averages will be calculated.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "The study includes two manipulated variables: the motion direction of the visual stimulus (approaching vs receding) and the presence vs absence of a subsequent tactile stimulus.", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Our main aim is to compare how the adult brain responds to tactile stimuli preceded by (unattended) approaching or receding visual stimuli. Therefore, we will record ERPs originating from sites close to somatosensory areas.

To this end, we will compute two difference waveforms subtracting, for each visual motion direction condition (Approaching vs Receding), the response recorded in the No-Touch condition (which is visual information alone) from the response recorded in the Touch condition (which is tactile and visual information). We will then average the difference waves and inspect the averaged topographic maps representing the scalp distribution of the electrical activity (Luck &amp; Gaspelin, 2017), in order to identify the presence of hotspots in the regions surrounding CP3 and CP4 in the 10-20 system. Then, we will visually inspect the averaged recordings from the electrodes within these hotspots. From these averaged recordings we will then isolate, for each hemisphere, a cluster of few electrodes showing the most pronounced SEP components (Rigato et al., 2017). In order to avoid biased measurements, the exact time window containing each component of interest will be determined by averaging the waveforms across participants and conditions (Luck &amp; Gaspelin, 2017). We will then calculate the mean individual amplitude of the difference waves across the electrode clusters and within the time window of interest, and compare the response to the touch when it was preceded by approaching vs receding visual displays.\n\nFor the analysis of the CNV component, we are interested in comparing the Approaching and Receding trials, irrespective of whether the motion will be followed by a touch or not. To this end, we will compute the averaged waveform of the responses in the approaching and receding trials, irrespective of whether the motion will be followed by a touch or not.

dots (a type of visual stimulus also known as a random dot kinematogram). It is just one of many different perceptual categorization tasks that could be used to investigate the hypothesis driving this preregistered research, which seeks to determine how rewards affect perceptual decision making. Behavior in perceptual decision tasks can be modeled by sequential sampling models such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM). The DDM (Ratcliff, Smith, Brown &amp; McKoon, 2016) fits complete reaction time distributions and successfully explains human speed-accuracy tradeoffs in two-choice perceptual tasks. The effect of rewards on behavior is not modeled by the DDM in its standard formulation. However, when the model's decision boundaries (a.k.a. \"thresholds\") are set to be inversely proportional to a leaky integral of the reward rate (e.g., the number of correct responses per second), the resulting model (Simen, Cohen &amp; Holmes, 2006; Simen &amp; Cohen, 2009) can adapt its speed-accuracy tradeoff so as to nearly maximize the rate of rewards being earned from performance. Reward rates are heavily influenced by the response-to-stimulus interval (RSI) of a task (Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes &amp; Cohen, 2006):  longer RSIs generally reduce reward rates for the model and for experimental participants by lengthening the time between rewards, and they also cause the reward-rate-optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff to shift toward accuracy and away from speed. Participants often show evidence of optimizing speed-accuracy tradeoffs so as to maximize reward rates accordingly (e.g, Simen, Contreras, Buck, Hu, Holmes &amp; Cohen, 2009). When the RSI changes, however, it takes time to optimize using this inverse-proportional threshold algorithm: reward rates build up or decay to new asymptotic levels over several trials, which causes decision boundaries to decay or build, respectively, over the same time period. This has the effect of increasing the model's response time autocorrelation, while at the same time strengthening the negative cross-correlation of the model's response times with its reward rates. We designed a random dot-motion experiment to test these predictions of the model, as well as to test whether reward magnitudes (e.g., points or dollars per correct response) affect decision boundary setting. The experiment presents participants with simple visual stimuli of dots randomly moving to the left or right. Participants are rewarded for correct responses with either one or two points. The key independent variables are the RSI, the reward magnitude for left or right, and the frequency with which RSI and reward magnitude change within the course of a block of trials.

It is just one of many different perceptual categorization tasks that could be used to investigate the hypothesis driving this preregistered research, which seeks to determine how rewards affect perceptual decision making. Behavior in perceptual decision tasks can be modeled by sequential sampling models such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM). The DDM (Ratcliff, Smith, Brown &amp; McKoon, 2016) fits complete reaction time distributions and successfully explains human speed-accuracy tradeoffs in two-choice perceptual tasks. The effect of rewards on behavior is not modeled by the DDM in its standard formulation. However, when the model's decision boundaries (a.k.a. \"thresholds\") are set to be inversely proportional to a leaky integral of the reward rate (e.g., the number of correct responses per second), the resulting model (Simen, Cohen &amp; Holmes, 2006; Simen &amp; Cohen, 2009) can adapt its speed-accuracy tradeoff so as to nearly maximize the rate of rewards being earned from performance. Reward rates are heavily influenced by the response-to-stimulus interval (RSI) of a task (Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes &amp; Cohen, 2006):  longer RSIs generally reduce reward rates for the model and for experimental participants by lengthening the time between rewards, and they also cause the reward-rate-optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff to shift toward accuracy and away from speed. Participants often show evidence of optimizing speed-accuracy tradeoffs so as to maximize reward rates accordingly (e.g, Simen, Contreras, Buck, Hu, Holmes &amp; Cohen, 2009). When the RSI changes, however, it takes time to optimize using this inverse-proportional threshold algorithm: reward rates build up or decay to new asymptotic levels over several trials, which causes decision boundaries to decay or build, respectively, over the same time period. This has the effect of increasing the model's response time autocorrelation, while at the same time strengthening the negative cross-correlation of the model's response times with its reward rates. We designed a random dot-motion experiment to test these predictions of the model, as well as to test whether reward magnitudes (e.g., points or dollars per correct response) affect decision boundary setting. The experiment presents participants with simple visual stimuli of dots randomly moving to the left or right. Participants are rewarded for correct responses with either one or two points. The key independent variables are the RSI, the reward magnitude for left or right, and the frequency with which RSI and reward magnitude change within the course of a block of trials. ", "q4": "1. Relative to task conditions in which average RSIs are constant, task conditions in which RSIs are dynamic should produce stronger response time autocorrelation (higher correlation coefficients at each trial lag). \n2. Larger reward magnitudes should produce faster responding and stronger response biases. \n3.
