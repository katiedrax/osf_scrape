The desirability of the water will be manipulated to either be inducing or quenching to the participants thirst. Participants with higher thirst are expected to perceive the water bottle as closer in perception than participants who are not thirsty.This is a between subjects design with 2 factors: thirsty--ate pretzels; quenched--drank as much water as they wanted. With one level: judged distance to a bottle of water. \n\nStudy 2a will measure desirability based on social values. Our ideal sample will consist of about 123 LSU students that will either receive candy or receive candy and a chance to win a $100 bill. We predict that the more desirable object, the $100 bill, will be perceived as being physically closer to the viewer than the candy. This is a between subjects design with 2 factors--receiving candy or receiving candy and a chance to win a $100 bill. Along with 2 levels--the participants judged how far they were away from the bill and they completed a creativity test as a measure of mood to be associated with creativity and randomness of responses. \n\nIn study 2b, about 90 LSU students will take a survey that assesses sense of humor that will be graded in their presence. Participants will be randomly assigned to positive and negative feedback conditions. After being told if they have a \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cabove average\u201d sense of humor, the participants will then be instructed to provide an estimate of how far away their test is.

Some participants will be exposed to the desired object and know the gift card has a value of $25.Other participants will be exposed to the less desirable object and know the gift card has a value of $0.

We want to expand on this study by then analyzing our data to determine if there is a significant difference between males and females on predicting distance when desirability is manipulated.

Additionally, Wright, Hill, Sharp, and Pickles (2018) reported that low sensitivity to distress predicted an elevated risk for callous-unemotional (CU) traits.

According\nto the 2014 survey of the Latin American Public Opinion Project, one third of Latin Americans\nidentified crime as their country's main problem. Such violent reality has already had important political consequences across the region. Academic research has revealed the political consequences of criminal violence and victimization experiences in Latin America, mainly focusing on democratic values and participation. Several works found that victims of crime are less likely to trust democratic institutions and support democratic attitudes (Fernandez and Kuenzi, 2010; Blanco, 2013; Carreras, 2013). Moreover, violence has also been shown to increase support for iron fist policies (Holland, 2013; Krause, 2014a; Visconti, 2019). Another set of studies has shown that crime is associated with higher levels of non-electoral forms of participation (Bateson, 2012), while at the same time diminishing electoral participation (Carreras and Trelles,2012; Cantu and Ley, 2017; Ley, 2018).\n\nOverall, prevailing evidence suggests that violence shapes citizens' views on politics, their\ninteraction with government authorities, and their preferences for security policies (Krause,\n2014b; Visconti, 2019; Garcia-Ponce et al., 2019). However, extant works have mainly focused\non mano dura policies , disregarding other policy approaches to crime. Additionally, political\nscientists have largely dismissed the processes through which preferences for security policies are shaped, failing to address how voters react to a potentially wide supply of policy approaches. In fact, what we know about how citizens form their electoral preferences amid violence is fairly limited (Ley, 2017).\n\nIn this pre-analysis plan, we present a conjoint experiment specifically designed to (a) understand citizens' preferences for security policies; (b) explain how and when different candidate and policy profiles can gain electoral support among voters; and (c) examine the effects of partisanship on preferences for security. In our experiment, respondents are presented with two hypothetical candidates for a municipal election in Mexico that vary along four different attributes, policy proposal for public security, gender, work experience, and political party, and are asked to indicate their preferred candidate. How do citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies? What is the role of victimization experiences and fear of crime on voters' electoral and policy preferences? How do voters process candidate profiles amid security concerns? These are some of the questions we seek to answer in this study.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-06T01:01:36.143108", "date_modified": "2020-04-05T18:01:55.664836", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Criminal Violence", "Political Behavior", "Security Policies"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": [], "year": null}, "analytics_key": "54b2f472b9df4b3ccc59ac20ed998eebba15e4dcc26b9c3dc58b763b956fee786106d623866d1eeadf964b68002050014fba161bab2c6a20b03e152f7e11d62002f42b83c671b1a4a135bb581573fd855ee903652c305aec199464bc77e47b6fc67c72fbdc69e2ffdbdde92b857451b3dad589c1fac54ef0d0089d34064b2693eaf86a21878b43866cc193c5704cddc1", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-06T01:01:36.125551", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Tiago Ventura, Sandra Ley, Francisco Cantu"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "Looking into popular support for policy proposals to address crime, our work examines different informational short-cuts through which voters process and filter information and, consequently, make decisions. In particular, we group our explanations into three groups: (1) candidate profile and party competence; (2) voter characteristics and social networks; and (3) partisanship.\n\nCandidate Profiles and Party Competence on Security Policies\n\nOur first set of hypotheses focuses on the extent to which some parties and candidates might benefit when campaigning on security as a policy issue. Being aware that political preferences are not merely defined by the demand side, but also by the supply of available choices, we examine how voters value candidates when their campaigns focus on security policy. Building on a growing literature on the credibility of sources (Botero et al., 2015) and voters\u2019 reactions to candidate characteristics (Campbell and Cowley, 2014), we argue that candidates with previous experience on crime control are more likely to be preferred by voters.\n\nPrevious professional experience in criminal justice agencies works in two ways. First, as McDermott (2005) shows, candidates\u2019 occupational labels serve as informational shortcuts to infer their competence or qualifications for the office in question. As a result, occupational cues can increase voters\u2019 likelihood to participate and support the candidate that is perceived to have a qualification advantage.\n\nSecond, a candidate\u2019s previous experience can also signal her credibility when making campaign promises to tackle crime. How to make candidates to fulfill their campaign promises once in office is one of the most studied questions in the political economy literature (Ferejohn, 1986; Przeworski et al., 1999; Besley, 2006). The main problem for voters is to distinguish an empty promise from a credible policy proposal. For the specific case of public security, candidates\u2019 professional experience serves as a heuristic to voters about how credible is a candidate\u2019s proposal on the topic. We expect then that a candidate with no previous experience on public security pays a credibility cost that makes her proposals unrealistic or naive.\n\nHypothesis 1. Candidates profiles whose work experience is unrelated to public security are less likely to be selected.\n\nWe proceed to measure how partisan cues matter for voters\u2019 evaluation of the candidates. Valence advantages at the party level (Clark, 2009; Calvo and Murillo, 2019; Clarke et al., 2011) and issue ownership (Kaplan et al., 2006) have been shown to function as a critical determinant of vote choice in a variety of contexts. On this matter, previous research indicates how conservative parties tend to have a stronger association with crime control policies and a stronger managerial reputation to deal with crime as their main priority (Holland, 2013; Beckett and Western, 2001). Therefore, we expect conservative parties to receive stronger support in our experiment, independent of more punitive or rehabilitative approach of the proposed policy. Hence, we expect that:\n\nHypothesis 2. Candidates profiles affiliated with more conservative parties are more likely to be selected.\n\nOverall, in this set of hypotheses, we explore how candidate profiles and parties\u2019 perceived competence relate to the wide variation of security policies we present to the respondents. In other words, our experiment explores interactive effects between the candidates\u2019 professional background and party affiliation with the type of security policy proposal. In this regard, we expect that:\n\nHypothesis 3. Conservative parties and candidates with professional experience on public security will show greater effects when associated with more punitive policy proposals compared to other more rehabilitative approaches.\n\nVoter Characteristics and Social Networks\n\nBased on the vast literature on social networks and political attitudes (Zuckerman, 2005), we explore how interactions within networks of victims may lead to a different understanding of crime and subsequently affect perceived policy needs and preferences. As Villarreal and Silva (2006) show, information exchanges through networks of individuals experiencing and perceiving crime can have profound attitudinal consequences and lead to a heightened sense of insecurity, which recent works have shown to greatly affect policy preferences (Visconti, 2019; Altamirano et al., 2020; Flores-Mac\u00edas and S\u00e1nchez-Talanquer, 2020).  Therefore, we propose that:\n\nHypothesis 4. Respondents that have faced crime victimization\u2014either personally or in their immediate social network\u2014are more likely to support punitive policies.\n\nExperiences with violence committed by police forces, however, are likely to have the opposite effect. As comparative evidence shows, from the United States (Desmond et al., 2016) to Brazil (Caldeira, 2002), police violence tends to generate distrust in police forces, as well as reduce crime reporting (Gingerich and Oliveros, 2018). Consequently, we would expect that:\n\nHypothesis 5. Respondents that have faced police violence\u2014either personally or in their immediate social network\u2014are less likely to support punitive policies.\n\nContinuing with our examination of voter characteristics, we explore an additional individual feature that may increase the probability to vote for a particular public security policy proposal. We focus on voters\u2019 general stances towards the role of the state and its police forces. We propose that:\n\nHypothesis 6. Respondents supporting tough-on-crime policy approaches will be more likely to choose a candidate proposing death penalty for criminals or the militarization of the police forces.\n\nPartisanship\n\nFollowing the Michigan School (Campbell et al., 1960), we study the way in which partisan attachments can affect voters\u2019 preferences for candidates. Ideological labels are a useful way in which voters can infer the policy preferences of parties and candidates once in office (Downs, 1957). In principle, the prevalence of ideologies attached to political parties helps voters identify the alternative that most resembles their own view of the world. Our first expectation is that partisanship serves as an information cost-saving device to decide among alternatives on the ballot (Fiorina, 1981). As a result, respondents are more likely to support the candidate from the party that they feel identified with.\n\nAt the same time, we consider the consequences of negative partisanship, which we define as an  adverse  affection  towards  a  political  party  (Medeiros  and  No\u00ebl,  2014;  Caruana  et  al.,  2015; Samuels and Zucco, 2018). Unlike its positive counterpart, we expect that voters will be less likely to support a candidate from the party they negatively identify with. This occurs because the heuristic that voters receive in this case is about a party supporting policies far away from her political preferences. As a result, even when a candidate proposes a policy closer to what the voter desires, it would be less likely to be selected if it is endorsed by a party that the voter negatively identifies with.\n\nHypothesis 7. Respondents are more likely to support the candidate from the party that they feel identified with.\n\nHypothesis 8. Negative partisans are less likely to choose a candidate from the party they dislike.\n\n\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

As a result, even when a candidate proposes a policy closer to what the voter desires, it would be less likely to be selected if it is endorsed by a party that the voter negatively identifies with.\n\nHypothesis 7. Respondents are more likely to support the candidate from the party that they feel identified with.\n\nHypothesis 8. Negative partisans are less likely to choose a candidate from the party they dislike.\n\n\n", "q3": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

This methodology quantifies the premium or the penalty that each candidate\u2019s attribute has on the voter\u2019s choice (Hainmueller et al., 2014). This methodology has been extensively used in consumer research behavior where, for example, respondents are provided information about certain attributes of a product with different levels for each attribute to participants in an experiment. These attributes and their different levels constitute a profile of a hypothetical product, and participants are asked to make a choice between the multiple products or rate their preferences for each of them. Conjoint experiments allow researchers to examine the weight that each attribute (and its levels) has on the choice or preference of products.\n\nWe are interested in two estimands, the Average Marginal Component Effect, and  the Average Component Interactive Effects, both as described and estimated by  Hainmueller et al. (2014). In addition, we intend to use the method in Egami and Imai (2019) also to estimate the interactive effects between some features in our conjoint. \n\nSection 5 of the attached pre-analysis presents a detailed description of the statistical models and modeling choices we commit to making.
