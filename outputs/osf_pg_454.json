The first technique is reestimation of the Shotts (2003) model using data produced from Monte Carlo simulations, allowing for errors in DW-Nominates. This technique will enable us to check whether the results in Shotts (2003) are robust to reasonable levels of error. This method is far from perfect, because errors in DW-Nominates presumably are correlated both across time and across members. However, to the best of our knowledge, no technique has been developed that would deal with this issue in DW-Nominate error. Hence, we will treat the errors as being independent. The second technique is to use a different measure of the ideology of elected officials, based on the Bonica (2014) estimates. Most of the input data for this study already exist and are readily available. All data used in Shotts\u2019s original study are available in his replication archive. Current DW-Nominate estimates, along with estimated standard errors are available from Keith Poole\u2019s website. The Bonica scores are available from his website. Simons and Mallinson have graciously provided the data they used in their extension of Shotts. As of the time that this document is being submitted to EGAP, we have not conducted any analysis of the data. Part 1: Re-Analysis of Shotts (2003) 1-1. Plot of raw DW-Nominates. To give a sense of the basic data before and after the 1990s redistricting, we will plot the Old and Current DW-Nominates for Southern Representatives and the House Median in the 102nd , 103rd, and 104th Congresses. This will give a rough sense of whether the count of the number of Southern representatives to the left of the median is sensitive to errors in measurement for DW-Nominates. 1-2. Reestimation of the original model using samples obtained from Monte Carlo simulations that allow for different levels of error in Old-DW-Nominates (i.e., the ones used in Shotts 2003). We will perform regressions for Shotts\u2019s key empirical specification (Table 1, p. 221) in a fashion similar to bootstrap resampling procedures. All variables except the dependent variable Left of Median and its lag will be exactly as in Shotts (2003). For the Left of Median variable, each iteration of the simulation will draw for each House Member in each year a DW-Nominate score from a normal distribution, with mean at his/her estimated mean. The standard deviation of the draws will range from 0 to 0.2, in 0.01 unit increments. Based on the work of Carroll et al (pp. 270-271) we believe that the most relevant standard deviation will be one around 0.05. However, we are examining smaller and larger values as well. We will perform 1000 iterations for each standard deviation between 0 and 0.2. The product of this analysis will be a figure. On the horizontal axis will be the standard deviation. On the vertical axis will be the proportion of the 1000 iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant (at the conventional 0.05 level) positive coefficient on the key variable of interest in Shotts (2003), namely Fraction Majority-Minority. We also will plot the proportion of iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant negative coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority, and report the mean and standard error from our iteration estimates. Given that Shotts\u2019s results were no longer statistically significant in Simons and Mallinson\u2019s analysis (which used DW-Nominates that they downloaded recently from Poole\u2019s website), we expect that a small amount of noise will dramatically reduce the proportion of the time that there is a statistically-significant positive coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority. However, to be clear, we don\u2019t have strong priors on how large the effect will be for different levels of the standard deviation. We do not expect that there will be many statistically-significant negative coefficients on Fraction Majority-Minority, at least for small standard deviations. 1-3. Monte Carlo using Carroll et al (2009) estimated standard errors in Current-DW-Nominates for individual members. This analysis will be very similar to part 1-2. However, there will be only one level of standard deviation in the DW-Nominate for each member of Congress. This will vary across members. Also, the DW-Nominates that we will use will be Current-DW-Nominates, because those are the ones for which estimated standard errors are available. We will conduct 1000 iterations of the simulated regression, and will report the proportion of the time that the coefficient on Fraction Majority-Minority was positive and statistically significant and the proportion of the time that it was negative and statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level. 1-4. Using Bonica scores to measure Left of Median. Another, very different, way of assessing the robustness of Shotts\u2019s results is to use a different measure of politicians\u2019 ideal points. We will do this using Bonica\u2019s (2014) measures, which are based on interest group contributions. For this analysis we will replicate Table 1 from Shotts (2003), using the same data for every variable except Fraction Left of Median and its lag, both of which will be calculated using Bonica\u2019s estimates of members\u2019 ideological positions. Part 2: Application to Simons and Mallinson 2-1. Monte Carlo simulation for different levels of error in Current-DW-Nominates. As above, in part 1-2, we will re-run Simons and Mallinson\u2019s model (the \u201cConditional Effects Model\u201d in Table 3 of the March 2015 version of their paper) using a Monte Carlo Simulation with the standard deviation of the DW-Nominate estimates allowed to vary from 0 to 0.2 in 0.01 unit increments. For each of the key independent variables (Fraction Majority-Minority, Unified Republican Control, Bipartisan Control, Majority-Minority X Unified Republican, and Majority-Minority X Bipartisan), we will plot the proportion of iterations that resulted in a statistically-significant positive coefficient as well as the proportion that resulted in a statistically-significant negative coefficient. 2-2. Monte Carlo simulation using Carroll et al (2009) estimated standard errors. As in part 1-3, we will re-run Simons and Mallinson\u2019s model using a simulation with estimated standard errors for Current-DW-Nominates. For each of the key independent variables, we will report the proportion of iterations in which the coefficient was positive and statistically significant as well as the proportion in which it was negative and statistically significant."}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Researchers"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": [""]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a4z79/providers/osfstorage/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a4z79/providers/osfstorage/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a4z79/providers/osfstorage/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/a4z79/providers/osfstorage/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122"}, "attributes": {"etag": "b4220bef7136152602df23363030c81b32a01efb0936fd1e742a6eb7228b8e51", "kind": "file", "name": "20150709AA_PAP.docx", "path": "/5e31dff3f6631d00195a3122", "size": 20223, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "0fb7ac5c17d7502f54fcbb7dbbd9cf20", "sha256": "a4253907f7b824112377e2fc85972e129bc9146adf0f1f4db25ab2b0dccdafa6"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 20223, "modified": "2020-01-29T19:41:39.323049+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "a4z79", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20150709AA_PAP.docx", "modified_utc": "2020-01-29T19:41:39+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "a4z79", "sha256": "a4253907f7b824112377e2fc85972e129bc9146adf0f1f4db25ab2b0dccdafa6", "viewUrl": "/project/z8mvy/files/osfstorage/5e31dff64b2010001620f534/", "selectedFileName": "20150709AA_PAP.docx"}], "value": "20150709AA_PAP.docx"}, "q38": {"extra": {}, "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Assessing Robustness of Findings About Racial Redistricting and Southern House Members", "q2": "Carlos Sanchez-Martinez | Kenneth Shotts", "q3": "20150709AA", "q4": "08/13/2015 - 15:36", "q5": "", "q6": "Yes", "q7": "", "q8": "Registration prior to any research activities", "q9": "", "q10": "No", "q11": "7/10/15", "q12": "", "q13": "No", "q14": "Yes", "q15": "Shotts (2003) analyzed the effect of racial redistricting in the 1980s and 1990s, using a dependent variable that was measured using DW-Nominates.

We will attempt to attract 660 subjects in total. Using an online survey, they will be pre-screened to exclude non-English speakers, psychology majors, and Harvard affiliated individuals. Other covariates will be collected and these covariates will be used to organize subjects into matched pairs and then randomized across pairs into integrated and segregated conditions with 20 or less people in each trial/condition. Randomization happens on the individual levels: Afterindicating at which times during the day they are available, subjects will be recruited in two hour blocks of time and will be randomly assigned to a one hour block of time. One of those blocks will be assigned to the integrated and one to the segregated condition. Within each condition, subjects will again be matched and will be randomly assigned to one of two minimal groups. The experiment will be conducted by research assistants that are blind to the hypothesis and purpose of the experiment. Participants will show up to the experimental setting and will be signed in. The order in which they arrive determines their participant ID number, which is pre-linked to their minimal group membership and their placement in physical space when assigned to the treatment. Within condition, their exact physical location has also been randomized. Once they are signed in, they will be led to their seat in a large lecture hall, with a randomly assigned seat linked to their participant ID number. Once seated they will be instructed to observe several images on an overhead projector, and to select one of five adjectives that best describes the image, and then to fill in their selection on a scantron. The images and the adjectives have been pre-chosen. For each image we used an online \u201crandom adjective\u201d service to select a base adjective to associate with the picture. We then looked up the adjective in a thesaurus and selected 5 synonyms of the word. We tended to pick the best match unless the word was too obscure, in which case we went down the list and selected the next most common one. In this manner we tried to make the selection between adjectives as meaningless as possible. Once the subjects are shown 10 pictures plus 1 example picture, research assistants collect their scantrons and tell the subjects that we are going to run the scantron to determine something called a \u201cperceptual type.\u201d This is the minimal group we are assigning them to. These types are generically named \u201cH\u201d and \u201cY\u201d types. Though we do not actually run the scantrons, we still need to convince the subjects that we are. Instead of just having them wait, we decided to provide the subjects with a distraction task, which research has shown makes minimal groups assignments more impactful. For our distraction task, we have participants try to find words in a wordsearch, and we do not provide them with a word list to make the task more difficult. Once a plausible amount of time has passed, a research assistant comes in and tells participants that we have discovered their perceptual type and that they will be moved into another room for the next portion of the experiment. This is where the treatment occurs. Participants will be moved to a waiting room and informed about the next phase of the experiment, essentially that they will be filling out a survey. After that, they will be informed that each participant will fill out a survey in a separate room on a laptop, and that they need to wait just a few minutes while the rooms are being prepared. In the integrated condition participants will be randomly assigned to their seats in the waiting room. In the segregated condition participants will be separated and will sit on the same side of the room as other members of their own group, but within each group they will still be randomly seated. Participants will be able to see whether the groups are segregated or integrated as each minimal group will have a color-coded folder sitting in front of them. Participants will then be given a map which also shows the locations of each participant ID number in individual rooms. They will be moved to separate rooms to avoid monitoring effects and will fill out a survey on a laptop and some of them will participate in a resource allocation task. In the resource allocation task, they are given ten dollars and told they can keep as much as they want or can share it by putting the money in envelopes marked separately for each of the groups. After completing their survey on a laptop in their own room, subjects are paid and given a debriefing form that describes the deception involved and gives them information on how to contact the researchers for further information. e collect three separate groups of measures: the participants\u2019 tendency to make negative attributions about both the ingroup and the outgroup; participants\u2019 tendency to perceive the ingroup as more similar to themselves; and participants\u2019 tendency to differentially attribute limited resources to the ingroup. Each of these three measures will take precedence in 1/3 of the surveys. In other words, in one third of the surveys the perception questions will go first, in one third the attributino questions will go first, and in one third the resource allocation task questions will go first. While all subjects will see the attribution and perception questions, with random ordering, only one third of our sample will be exposed to the resource allocation task. For each of these measures, we will test the responses of all subjects, but we will accept the answers of subjects that saw the measure first as most valid because that will eliminate concerns that answers are being anchored off their previous answers. For each of the first two groups of measures, we collect several survey question answers. Within each group, these will be scaled into factors and these factors will be tested for difference between conditions. However, we will also report responses to each individual question. Survey questions are included in the additional document provided with this registration. We will subset our data in several ways and perform the same tests within each subset. First we will look at differences in responses between individuals sitting close to the outgroup and further from the outgroup. In each condition, several members are assigned in such a way so as to be equidistant from both ingroup and outgroup members. Subsetting to these individuals allows us to separate the effects of distance from segregation. We can also control for distance in regression inference. Second, as is common in minimal groups experiments, we will subset to individuals who indicate that they identify with the ingroup. This is an important step in our condition because our quantity of interest is the difference between the integrated and segregated conditions and these conditions are meaningless outside of the assigned minimal groups. We will do this by scaling several questions about ingroup identification into a single factor and splitting at the median so that we can test separately for high and low identifying individuals. Because subjects are invited to arrive at certain times, some sessions may have more subjects than others. This may moderate the strength of the treatment because segregation may not be as obvious with only a small group of people as it is with a larger group of people. We will look at session size as a moderating variable. Finally, we also intend to subset our data by gender and political party to see if our results hold differently for these different groups. Since males have a greater tendency for stronger intergroup competition, we expect to see greater results for that group. Additionally, theory suggests that strong partisans are more likely to have strong biases than weak partisans, so we want to test whether the results are moderated by partisanship. The test of interest is a difference in differences test for outgroup responses minus ingroup responses for segregated minus integrated. The outgroup-ingroup difference is expected to be higher in the integrated condition. This is a between-subjects test because each subject is only assigned to one condition. Because answers may be anchored to the group they were asked about first, and outgroup and ingroup were randomized, we will also examine results without the difference in difference design, in other words, we will separately examine ingroup measures in integrated versus segregated and outgroup measures in integrated versus segregated. Where appropriate, this will be tested using a T-test for a simple difference of means or a Wilcox-Mann-Whitney Test for non-normal distributions.

We will attempt to attract 660 subjects in total. Using an online survey, they will be pre-screened to exclude non-English speakers, psychology majors, and Harvard affiliated individuals. Other covariates will be collected and these covariates will be used to organize subjects into matched pairs and then randomized across pairs into integrated and segregated conditions with 20 or less people in each trial/condition. Randomization happens on the individual levels: Afterindicating at which times during the day they are available, subjects will be recruited in two hour blocks of time and will be randomly assigned to a one hour block of time. One of those blocks will be assigned to the integrated and one to the segregated condition. Within each condition, subjects will again be matched and will be randomly assigned to one of two minimal groups. The experiment will be conducted by research assistants that are blind to the hypothesis and purpose of the experiment. Participants will show up to the experimental setting and will be signed in. The order in which they arrive determines their participant ID number, which is pre-linked to their minimal group membership and their placement in physical space when assigned to the treatment. Within condition, their exact physical location has also been randomized. Once they are signed in, they will be led to their seat in a large lecture hall, with a randomly assigned seat linked to their participant ID number. Once seated they will be instructed to observe several images on an overhead projector, and to select one of five adjectives that best describes the image, and then to fill in their selection on a scantron. The images and the adjectives have been pre-chosen. For each image we used an online \u201crandom adjective\u201d service to select a base adjective to associate with the picture. We then looked up the adjective in a thesaurus and selected 5 synonyms of the word. We tended to pick the best match unless the word was too obscure, in which case we went down the list and selected the next most common one. In this manner we tried to make the selection between adjectives as meaningless as possible. Once the subjects are shown 10 pictures plus 1 example picture, research assistants collect their scantrons and tell the subjects that we are going to run the scantron to determine something called a \u201cperceptual type.\u201d This is the minimal group we are assigning them to. These types are generically named \u201cH\u201d and \u201cY\u201d types. Though we do not actually run the scantrons, we still need to convince the subjects that we are. Instead of just having them wait, we decided to provide the subjects with a distraction task, which research has shown makes minimal groups assignments more impactful. For our distraction task, we have participants try to find words in a wordsearch, and we do not provide them with a word list to make the task more difficult. Once a plausible amount of time has passed, a research assistant comes in and tells participants that we have discovered their perceptual type and that they will be moved into another room for the next portion of the experiment. This is where the treatment occurs. Participants will be moved to a waiting room and informed about the next phase of the experiment, essentially that they will be filling out a survey. After that, they will be informed that each participant will fill out a survey in a separate room on a laptop, and that they need to wait just a few minutes while the rooms are being prepared. In the integrated condition participants will be randomly assigned to their seats in the waiting room. In the segregated condition participants will be separated and will sit on the same side of the room as other members of their own group, but within each group they will still be randomly seated. Participants will be able to see whether the groups are segregated or integrated as each minimal group will have a color-coded folder sitting in front of them. Participants will then be given a map which also shows the locations of each participant ID number in individual rooms. They will be moved to separate rooms to avoid monitoring effects and will fill out a survey on a laptop and some of them will participate in a resource allocation task. In the resource allocation task, they are given ten dollars and told they can keep as much as they want or can share it by putting the money in envelopes marked separately for each of the groups. After completing their survey on a laptop in their own room, subjects are paid and given a debriefing form that describes the deception involved and gives them information on how to contact the researchers for further information. e collect three separate groups of measures: the participants\u2019 tendency to make negative attributions about both the ingroup and the outgroup; participants\u2019 tendency to perceive the ingroup as more similar to themselves; and participants\u2019 tendency to differentially attribute limited resources to the ingroup. Each of these three measures will take precedence in 1/3 of the surveys. In other words, in one third of the surveys the perception questions will go first, in one third the attributino questions will go first, and in one third the resource allocation task questions will go first. While all subjects will see the attribution and perception questions, with random ordering, only one third of our sample will be exposed to the resource allocation task. For each of these measures, we will test the responses of all subjects, but we will accept the answers of subjects that saw the measure first as most valid because that will eliminate concerns that answers are being anchored off their previous answers. For each of the first two groups of measures, we collect several survey question answers. Within each group, these will be scaled into factors and these factors will be tested for difference between conditions. However, we will also report responses to each individual question. Survey questions are included in the additional document provided with this registration. We will subset our data in several ways and perform the same tests within each subset. First we will look at differences in responses between individuals sitting close to the outgroup and further from the outgroup. In each condition, several members are assigned in such a way so as to be equidistant from both ingroup and outgroup members. Subsetting to these individuals allows us to separate the effects of distance from segregation. We can also control for distance in regression inference. Second, as is common in minimal groups experiments, we will subset to individuals who indicate that they identify with the ingroup. This is an important step in our condition because our quantity of interest is the difference between the integrated and segregated conditions and these conditions are meaningless outside of the assigned minimal groups. We will do this by scaling several questions about ingroup identification into a single factor and splitting at the median so that we can test separately for high and low identifying individuals. Because subjects are invited to arrive at certain times, some sessions may have more subjects than others. This may moderate the strength of the treatment because segregation may not be as obvious with only a small group of people as it is with a larger group of people. We will look at session size as a moderating variable. Finally, we also intend to subset our data by gender and political party to see if our results hold differently for these different groups. Since males have a greater tendency for stronger intergroup competition, we expect to see greater results for that group. Additionally, theory suggests that strong partisans are more likely to have strong biases than weak partisans, so we want to test whether the results are moderated by partisanship. The test of interest is a difference in differences test for outgroup responses minus ingroup responses for segregated minus integrated. The outgroup-ingroup difference is expected to be higher in the integrated condition. This is a between-subjects test because each subject is only assigned to one condition. Because answers may be anchored to the group they were asked about first, and outgroup and ingroup were randomized, we will also examine results without the difference in difference design, in other words, we will separately examine ingroup measures in integrated versus segregated and outgroup measures in integrated versus segregated. Where appropriate, this will be tested using a T-test for a simple difference of means or a Wilcox-Mann-Whitney Test for non-normal distributions. We will also be able to use pre-treatment covariates in regression-based estimates.\"", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "Yes", "q21": "", "q22": "Yes", "q23": "", "q24": "", "q25": "", "q26":

In response to these challenges, between 2007 and 2014, the IRC and CARE International carried out the Tuungane program. Tuungane is a community driven development (CDD) program, which is a widely applied and growing form of intervention that takes a bottom-up approach to designing and implementing development projects. Funded by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID), the program went through two phases. The first, \u00a330 million phase of the program \u201cTuungane 1\u201d (T1) operated between 2007 and 2011. The second, \u00a360 million phase of the program, \u201cTuungane 2\u201d (T2), was carried out between 2011 and 2014. T1 aimed to support local governance, social cohesion and economic recovery in 1,250 randomly selected Village Development Committee (VDC) areas, and 280 Community Development Committee (CDC) areas. T2 continued to apply the CDD approach and worked in 1,025 VDCs in the same provinces as Tuungane 1 with the addition of North Kivu. These communities, however, were not randomly selected. Humphreys, Sanchez and Van der Windt (2012) - HSW (2012) - explored the impact of a subset of T1 activities (the data collection for that study took place between 2010 and 2012). The evaluation found no evidence that Tuungane had an effect on the stated goals of improving economic and social outcomes. The evaluation proposed here moves beyond HSW (2012) in four important ways. First, HSW (2012) focused solely on a subset of T1 activities (the so-called VDC component). HSW (2012) do not capture the effects of the \u201cCDC component\u201d, which accounts financially for the largest share of the T1 envelope and involves a significant infrastructure project per CDC area. Second, HSW (2012) placed primary emphasis on the impact of the VDC component on governance outcomes. In this study, we investigate if the program had an impact on service provision, and education, health and economic outcomes. Third, we know little about the long-term impacts of CDD programs. Previous studies, including HSW (2012), were conducted shortly after the end of the CDD program. It is possible that very different estimates might have been produced if data were gathered several years later. This evaluation is set to take place around five years after T1 was implemented. Finally, one possible explanation for the lack of evidence (or at best mixed evidence) found in favor of the CDD model is that the assumptions and pathways of change underpinning the theory of change for CDD programs are wrong. This study incorporates a qualitative component that explores the extent to which the assumptions and mechanisms underpinning Tuungane\u2019s theory of change are warranted.

"Would-be reformers of entitlement programs for the elderly (i.e., Social Security and Medicare) frequently include a \"carve-out\" or exemption for current or soon-to-be retirees from their proposed changes, which would spare older Americans from the pain of benefit cuts or increased individual risk. The political calculus behind such carve-outs is clear - the reformers hope they will make the reforms more palatable to the politically active seniors who depend on them. But does this political strategy actually work? More broadly, do older Americans respond to appeals to self-interest in Social Security and Medicare proposals? These questions are relevant not just to policy debates, but to an important debate in the academic literature between scholars who argue for the importance of self-interest and those who emphasize sociotropic or symbolic concerns over self-interest in the formation of policy attitudes. One of the central difficulties in resolving this debate is the difficulty in distinguishing between true, narrow self-interest and a more altruistic concern for other citizens with whom an individual identifies (i.e., \"people like me\"). In this study, I use an innovative survey experiment that exploits both experimental variation and respondent birth date to produce a reliable estimate of a self-interest effect in older Americans' attitudes toward a hypothetical Medicare reform proposal based on Paul Ryan's \"premium support\" proposal for the program. Specifically, the survey will ask a sample of 59 and 60 year old Americans whether or not they approve of the proposal, but I will randomly vary the description to include an exemption for those born after December 31, 1955 - essentially, those age 60 and up. Thus, self-interest considerations will be in play for some respondents but not others in the treatment group. By analyzing differences across treatment and age groups with a variety of approaches, I will be able to reliably disentangle self-interest effects from the effects of other-regarding concerns."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Medicare reform proposals with exemptions for people born before a certain year will receive greater support from older Americans than those with no exemption.

H3: Older Americans will exhibit higher levels of support for Medicare reform proposals that exempt those slightly older than themselves from changes than those that contain no exemption, even though they themselves are unaffected by the difference.

The political calculus behind such carve-outs is clear - the reformers hope they will make the reforms more palatable to the politically active seniors who depend on them. But does this political strategy actually work? More broadly, do older Americans respond to appeals to self-interest in Social Security and Medicare proposals? These questions are relevant not just to policy debates, but to an important debate in the academic literature between scholars who argue for the importance of self-interest and those who emphasize sociotropic or symbolic concerns over self-interest in the formation of policy attitudes. One of the central difficulties in resolving this debate is the difficulty in distinguishing between true, narrow self-interest and a more altruistic concern for other citizens with whom an individual identifies (i.e., \"people like me\"). In this study, I use an innovative survey experiment that exploits both experimental variation and respondent birth date to produce a reliable estimate of a self-interest effect in older Americans' attitudes toward a hypothetical Medicare reform proposal based on Paul Ryan's \"premium support\" proposal for the program. Specifically, the survey will ask a sample of 59 and 60 year old Americans whether or not they approve of the proposal, but I will randomly vary the description to include an exemption for those born after December 31, 1955 - essentially, those age 60 and up. Thus, self-interest considerations will be in play for some respondents but not others in the treatment group. By analyzing differences across treatment and age groups with a variety of approaches, I will be able to reliably disentangle self-interest effects from the effects of other-regarding concerns.", "q16": "H1: Medicare reform proposals with exemptions for people born before a certain year will receive greater support from older Americans than those with no exemption.

levels of crime and violence, attitudes towards the state, and compliance with security and justice sector institutions in rural Liberia. Despite over a decade of reform, the Liberian National Police (LNP) remains widely viewed as corrupt, ineffective and inaccessible. In an attempt to improve Liberians\u2019 perceptions of the LNP and the government more generally, the government of Liberia instituted a \u201cconfidence patrols\u201d program in which teams of newly-retrained, better-equipped police officers visit towns and villages throughout rural Liberia to \u201csensitize\u201d residents to increased police presence in and around their communities. The program is being implemented alongside the construction of five Regional Justice and Security Hubs, designed to extend the reach of the police and courts in rural areas. The Hubs constitute an unprecedented increase in the quantity and (potentially) quality of justice and security provision in rural Liberia, and are widely considered the cornerstone of the government's efforts at state consolidation and security sector reform, and a prerequisite for the UN Mission in Liberia's withdrawal. We evaluate the confidence patrols program by randomizing the geographical and temporal distribution of patrols across 72 communities (36 treatment, 36 control) in three counties: Bong, Lofa and Nimba. Assignment to treatment was stratified by county. The treatment consisted of public meetings in which groups of 10-15 uniformed officers from the Police Support Unit (PSU) delivered presentations, solicited questions and engaged in conversations with local leaders and residents. The public meetings also included demonstrations of Ebola prevention and care techniques, conducted by public health workers and PSU officers specifically trained in the administration of these techniques. These demonstrations were phased out as the Ebola epidemic waned."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "PRIMARY AND SECONDARY HYPOTHESES We divide our hypotheses into \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d outcomes; we expect we are more likely to observe treatment effects on the former than the latter. Among our primary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will: 1. Increase knowledge of the police and of Liberian law more generally; 2. Improve perceptions of the police; 3. Reduce the incidence of crime and violence; 4. Increase willingness to report to the police when incidents of crime and violence occur (even when reporting requires that disputants circumvent local leaders), and increase cooperation and compliance with the police more generally; 5. Reduce reliance on illegal or extrajudicial mechanisms for dispute resolution (e.g. trial by ordeal or mob violence); 6. Increase perceived efficacy in registering complaints against the police (e.g. about incidents of corruption or police brutality); 7. Increase support for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police (especially \u201ccommunity watch forums\u201d). Among our secondary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will: 1. Reduce the incidence of Ebola; 2. Increase security of property rights; 3. Increase tax compliance; 4. Improve perceptions of the Liberian government more generally. We do not necessarily expect to observe treatment effects on these secondary outcomes, as they are further removed from the treatment. We do, however, view them as relevant, and will include them in our analysis. HETEROGENEITY BY TIMING AND INTENSITY OF TREATMENT We expect that the magnitude of these effects will vary depending on when and how many times each community was patrolled. In particular, we hypothesize that: 1. The more recent the last patrol, the larger the effects. 2. The more numerous the patrols, the larger the effects. HETEROGENEITY BY INDIVIDUAL- & COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS We will estimate heterogeneous treatment effects along six dimensions: (1) gender, (2) ethnicity, (3) age, (4) exposure to violence during the Liberian civil war, (5) prior exposure to and experience with the LNP, and (5) leadership role within the community . We will operationalize exposure to wartime violence as an additive index capturing respondents\u2019 reports of victimization. We will distinguish between violence perpetrated by government security forces and violence perpetrated by rebels. We will operationalize prior exposure to the LNP as an indicator for whether or not the community has an existing LNP depot."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "DATA Most of our outcomes are measured through a large-N survey of all treatment and control communities. The survey consists of two instruments: one administered to a sample of 18 randomly-selected residents per community, and a second administered to five purposively-selected local leaders: the town or village chief, two elders, a women\u2019s group leader and a youth group leader. Willingness to report to the police is also measured through administrative data collection at all LNP depots in these three counties. Support for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police is also measured behaviorally. At the end of the residents survey we include an option for respondents to donate a portion of their sitting fee (70 Liberian dollars) to support an existing or potential community watch forum in their town or village. We interpret these donations as a behavioral measure of residents\u2019 support for the community watch forum, and more generally of their willingness to forgo income in order to improve coordination between their community and the police. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES We operationalize treatment as a dummy indicating whether or not the community was assigned to the treatment group. To test the effect of timing, we run a second specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of months between endline data collection and the most recent patrol. Finally, to test the effect of number of patrols, we run a third specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of patrols each community received. DEPENDENT VARIABLES We operationalize most of our dependent variables at the individual level. We will cluster our dependent variables by \u201ctheme\u201d (e.g. incidence of crime and violence, willingness to report to the police, etc.) and compute the Average Effect Size within each cluster, following the procedure proposed in Kling et al. (2004) and Clingingsmith et al. (2008). Standard errors will be clustered at the community level. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY Residents may have been exposed to treatment in one of three ways: (1) directly, by attending community-wide meetings with the patrolling officers; (2) directly, by interacting with the patrolling officers as they circulated throughout the community; or (3) indirectly, via spillover from residents who attended community-wide meetings and/or interacted with the patrolling officers. Because these forms of direct exposure were not randomly assigned, however, we focus on estimating an intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, with community-level assignment to treatment as the independent variable of interest. Because all of the communities assigned to treatment were indeed treated, and because none of the communities assigned to control were treated, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) should be identical to the ITT. Finally, following Blattman, Hartman and Blair (2014), we conduct a bounding exercise in which we estimate the potential range of treatment effects on individuals who reside in treatment communities but do not report attending community-wide meetings or otherwise interacting with patrolling officers. While not definitive, this exercise will help us estimate how much of the ITT is likely a result of spillover to untreated residents. We estimate treatment effects for residents and local leaders both separately and together. When estimating treatment effects for residents and local leaders together, we pool both samples and control for leadership position within the community. CONTROLS In our base specification we control for gender, age, household size, tribe, religion, education, literacy, employment and wealth. For local leaders we also control for position in the community (e.g. town or village chief, women\u2019s group leader, etc.) We also control for population, mobile phone coverage, distance from the nearest usable arterial road, distance from the nearest police station, an indicator for whether or not there is an LNP depot in the community, and an index of public services (clinics, schools, wells, latrines and guesthouses) at the community level. Community-level controls are measured in the survey of local leaders. Because the confidence patrols program was partly implemented during the Ebola epidemic, we opted not to collect baseline data in order to avoid exposing survey enumerators to unnecessary risk of infection. (All PSU officers were trained in Ebola prevention and care prior to deployment on the patrols. We will discuss this in further detail in our academic paper and policy report.) We measure our controls at endline, and include only those that either cannot (e.g. age) or are unlikely (e.g. literacy) to be affected by treatment. We will also report treatment effects with and without these controls. PREPROCESSING OF DATA For continuous measures, we cap outliers at the 99th percentile. We exclude any observations with a dfbeta greater than 2/sqrt(N). References Blattman, Christopher, Alexandra C. Hartman, and Robert A.

Despite over a decade of reform, the Liberian National Police (LNP) remains widely viewed as corrupt, ineffective and inaccessible. In an attempt to improve Liberians\u2019 perceptions of the LNP and the government more generally, the government of Liberia instituted a \u201cconfidence patrols\u201d program in which teams of newly-retrained, better-equipped police officers visit towns and villages throughout rural Liberia to \u201csensitize\u201d residents to increased police presence in and around their communities. The program is being implemented alongside the construction of five Regional Justice and Security Hubs, designed to extend the reach of the police and courts in rural areas. The Hubs constitute an unprecedented increase in the quantity and (potentially) quality of justice and security provision in rural Liberia, and are widely considered the cornerstone of the government's efforts at state consolidation and security sector reform, and a prerequisite for the UN Mission in Liberia's withdrawal. We evaluate the confidence patrols program by randomizing the geographical and temporal distribution of patrols across 72 communities (36 treatment, 36 control) in three counties: Bong, Lofa and Nimba. Assignment to treatment was stratified by county. The treatment consisted of public meetings in which groups of 10-15 uniformed officers from the Police Support Unit (PSU) delivered presentations, solicited questions and engaged in conversations with local leaders and residents. The public meetings also included demonstrations of Ebola prevention and care techniques, conducted by public health workers and PSU officers specifically trained in the administration of these techniques. These demonstrations were phased out as the Ebola epidemic waned.", "q16": "PRIMARY AND SECONDARY HYPOTHESES We divide our hypotheses into \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d outcomes; we expect we are more likely to observe treatment effects on the former than the latter. Among our primary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will: 1. Increase knowledge of the police and of Liberian law more generally; 2. Improve perceptions of the police; 3. Reduce the incidence of crime and violence; 4. Increase willingness to report to the police when incidents of crime and violence occur (even when reporting requires that disputants circumvent local leaders), and increase cooperation and compliance with the police more generally; 5. Reduce reliance on illegal or extrajudicial mechanisms for dispute resolution (e.g. trial by ordeal or mob violence); 6. Increase perceived efficacy in registering complaints against the police (e.g. about incidents of corruption or police brutality); 7. Increase support for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police (especially \u201ccommunity watch forums\u201d). Among our secondary outcomes, we hypothesize that the confidence patrols program will: 1. Reduce the incidence of Ebola; 2. Increase security of property rights; 3. Increase tax compliance; 4. Improve perceptions of the Liberian government more generally. We do not necessarily expect to observe treatment effects on these secondary outcomes, as they are further removed from the treatment. We do, however, view them as relevant, and will include them in our analysis. HETEROGENEITY BY TIMING AND INTENSITY OF TREATMENT We expect that the magnitude of these effects will vary depending on when and how many times each community was patrolled. In particular, we hypothesize that: 1. The more recent the last patrol, the larger the effects. 2. The more numerous the patrols, the larger the effects. HETEROGENEITY BY INDIVIDUAL- & COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS We will estimate heterogeneous treatment effects along six dimensions: (1) gender, (2) ethnicity, (3) age, (4) exposure to violence during the Liberian civil war, (5) prior exposure to and experience with the LNP, and (5) leadership role within the community . We will operationalize exposure to wartime violence as an additive index capturing respondents\u2019 reports of victimization. We will distinguish between violence perpetrated by government security forces and violence perpetrated by rebels. We will operationalize prior exposure to the LNP as an indicator for whether or not the community has an existing LNP depot.", "q17": "DATA Most of our outcomes are measured through a large-N survey of all treatment and control communities. The survey consists of two instruments: one administered to a sample of 18 randomly-selected residents per community, and a second administered to five purposively-selected local leaders: the town or village chief, two elders, a women\u2019s group leader and a youth group leader. Willingness to report to the police is also measured through administrative data collection at all LNP depots in these three counties. Support for community-level institutions designed to facilitate coordination between civilians and the police is also measured behaviorally. At the end of the residents survey we include an option for respondents to donate a portion of their sitting fee (70 Liberian dollars) to support an existing or potential community watch forum in their town or village. We interpret these donations as a behavioral measure of residents\u2019 support for the community watch forum, and more generally of their willingness to forgo income in order to improve coordination between their community and the police. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES We operationalize treatment as a dummy indicating whether or not the community was assigned to the treatment group. To test the effect of timing, we run a second specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of months between endline data collection and the most recent patrol. Finally, to test the effect of number of patrols, we run a third specification in which we operationalize treatment as the number of patrols each community received. DEPENDENT VARIABLES We operationalize most of our dependent variables at the individual level. We will cluster our dependent variables by \u201ctheme\u201d (e.g. incidence of crime and violence, willingness to report to the police, etc.) and compute the Average Effect Size within each cluster, following the procedure proposed in Kling et al. (2004) and Clingingsmith et al. (2008). Standard errors will be clustered at the community level. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY Residents may have been exposed to treatment in one of three ways: (1) directly, by attending community-wide meetings with the patrolling officers; (2) directly, by interacting with the patrolling officers as they circulated throughout the community; or (3) indirectly, via spillover from residents who attended community-wide meetings and/or interacted with the patrolling officers. Because these forms of direct exposure were not randomly assigned, however, we focus on estimating an intent-to-treat (ITT) effect, with community-level assignment to treatment as the independent variable of interest. Because all of the communities assigned to treatment were indeed treated, and because none of the communities assigned to control were treated, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) should be identical to the ITT. Finally, following Blattman, Hartman and Blair (2014), we conduct a bounding exercise in which we estimate the potential range of treatment effects on individuals who reside in treatment communities but do not report attending community-wide meetings or otherwise interacting with patrolling officers. While not definitive, this exercise will help us estimate how much of the ITT is likely a result of spillover to untreated residents. We estimate treatment effects for residents and local leaders both separately and together. When estimating treatment effects for residents and local leaders together, we pool both samples and control for leadership position within the community. CONTROLS In our base specification we control for gender, age, household size, tribe, religion, education, literacy, employment and wealth. For local leaders we also control for position in the community (e.g. town or village chief, women\u2019s group leader, etc.) We also control for population, mobile phone coverage, distance from the nearest usable arterial road, distance from the nearest police station, an indicator for whether or not there is an LNP depot in the community, and an index of public services (clinics, schools, wells, latrines and guesthouses) at the community level. Community-level controls are measured in the survey of local leaders. Because the confidence patrols program was partly implemented during the Ebola epidemic, we opted not to collect baseline data in order to avoid exposing survey enumerators to unnecessary risk of infection. (All PSU officers were trained in Ebola prevention and care prior to deployment on the patrols. We will discuss this in further detail in our academic paper and policy report.) We measure our controls at endline, and include only those that either cannot (e.g. age) or are unlikely (e.g. literacy) to be affected by treatment. We will also report treatment effects with and without these controls. PREPROCESSING OF DATA For continuous measures, we cap outliers at the 99th percentile. We exclude any observations with a dfbeta greater than 2/sqrt(N). References Blattman, Christopher, Alexandra C. Hartman, and Robert A.
