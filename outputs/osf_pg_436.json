"Beliefs in magic and superstitions have been observed to influence a range of outcomes, including warfare, business and electoral choice (Tsang 2004; Nunn and Sanchez de la Sierra 2017; Hirshleifer et al 2016). In the context of migration, previous studies have documented the ubiquity of superstitious beliefs in influencing when, where and how aspiring migrants decide to undertake their journeys abroad (Bastide 2015, Hagan 2008, Levitt 2003). For example, Hagan, and Ebaugh (2003) describe the role of pentecostal pastors in Guatemala as migration \"advisors,\" while religious guides - \"marabouts\" - in Senegal provide migrants with a range of services, from spiritual protection, to suggesting appropriate departure dates, to scanning passenger lists for problematic individuals with whom contact should be avoided (Hern\u00e1ndez-Carretero and Carling 2012). Similarly, in his ethnography of Mexican farmworkers in California's Central Valley, Holmes (2013, p.1) notes that, amongst the few items migrants carry with them on their desert crossing into the US, is usually \"a plastic bag with coyote fur and pine sap [called a 'suerte', meaning 'luck'] made by a Triqui healer for protection.\" However, most of the existing research on superstition and migration stems from qualitative interviews and anecdotal evidence from migrants' life histories. Building on these findings, this study empirically investigates whether magical and superstitious beliefs influence the decision to migrate using an original longitudinal data set. We do so in the context of The Gambia, which has seen some of the highest migration rates in the world in recent years. Most migrants from The Gambia aim to reach Europe - an endeavour that is exceptionally risky. It is estimated that up to 20% of individuals who set out on the journey perish along the way (e.g., Camara and Hunt\u00f6 2018). The country also is a context where beliefs in magic are common. We hypothesize that magical beliefs make individuals likely to underestimate the risk of the migratory journey, and make them more trusting of smugglers, who often betray this trust. In order to test these hypotheses, we ask 10,000 potential migrants who will be re-interviewed several times during a 9-months period. This will allow us to observe actual migration decisions, and to link these to beliefs in magic, risk attitudes and trust perceptions."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "One possible explanation linking risky migration decisions to magic relates to the fact that individuals often underestimate negative outcomes (and overestimate positive ones) if they relate to themselves vis-\u00e0-vis to a general or more objective assessment of the situation.

We argue that superstitions, fatalism, and the usage of ``magic'' such as lucky charms and protection spells, function as a driver of such overconfidence. Hence, we define overconfidence twofold: as the absolute perception of the risk of dying, and as the difference of the respondent's perception between the individual and the general risk of dying. Overconfidence assumption: Magic beliefs are related to lower perceptions of individual risk. Another possible explanation is that magic rituals make individuals unwarranted trusting in smugglers and other facilitators of their migration journey. Such facilitators are known to often betray and exploit their customers, sometimes putting them in mortal danger.

Increasingly, they are being held in developing countries with financial support from international democracy-promotion organizations on the grounds that they strengthen democracy (NDI 2014)}. In developing democracies, debates have the potential to provide valuable information to citizens on the character and policy positions of politicians. Despite the increasing prevalence of candidate debates, there is almost no causal evidence that assesses the impact of debates on voter preferences and voter attitudes towards democracy, especially outside of the US context. Notable exceptions are Bidwell et al. (2016), who conduct a randomized experiment to measure the effect of parliamentary debates in Sierra Leone, and Platas Izama and Raffler (2016), who conduct an experiment around \"meet the candidate\" sessions, which are similar in structure to debates, in Uganda. Our project complements and seeks to build upon these studies. This study seeks to help fill this gap. The project involves an opportunity to conduct a field experiment on the effects of parliamentary debates on voter preferences in the run-up to Ghana's general elections on 7th December 2016. The debates are being organized by the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD), a leading civil society organization in Ghana. As we are primarily interested in understanding how and why debates impact voters' political preferences, and we aim to conduct in-depth qualitative research on the campaigns in our study areas, we are working in three constituencies, collecting a range of detailed descriptive and experimental data from a sample of roughly 2,000 citizens. The study has two broad objectives: 1) to study the impact of debates on voters' evaluations of candidates and their attitudes towards democracy; and 2) to study the impact of debates on the downstream performance of elected candidates during their terms in office. This pre-analysis plan focuses on the first goal. This project is being funded by the International Growth Centre (IGC) and APSA Centennial Center. The study has IRB approval from George Washington University and UCLA."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Debates have a positive effect on voters' evaluations of candidates who participate in the debates.

In each constituency, we worked with our partner organization to record the parliamentary debates that took place in that constituency. We sample electoral areas within constituencies (stratifying on electoral competition) to serve as sampling locations for the study. Within electoral areas, individual participants are randomly sampled. Individual participants will be randomly assigned to a debate treatment or a control (placebo) condition. In order to test mechanisms, we \"unbundle\" the debate treatment, which will allow us to experimentally test hypotheses about the potential mechanisms linking debates to outcomes. To do so, we divide the debates into two segments. The first segment, segment A, will focus on candidate background and qualifications. The debate moderator will ask each candidate to describe their personal background, qualifications, and values. This segment will thus allow candidates to discuss the characteristics that they believe make them high quality candidates and to convey to voters information about their personality and character. The second segment, segment B, will focus on the candidates policy and programmatic positions. The debate moderator will ask each candidate to discuss their positions on two salient policy areas: education and unemployment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions. The unit of randomization is at the level of the individual participant.

Increasingly, they are being held in developing countries with financial support from international democracy-promotion organizations on the grounds that they strengthen democracy (NDI 2014)}. In developing democracies, debates have the potential to provide valuable information to citizens on the character and policy positions of politicians. Despite the increasing prevalence of candidate debates, there is almost no causal evidence that assesses the impact of debates on voter preferences and voter attitudes towards democracy, especially outside of the US context. Notable exceptions are Bidwell et al. (2016), who conduct a randomized experiment to measure the effect of parliamentary debates in Sierra Leone, and Platas Izama and Raffler (2016), who conduct an experiment around \"meet the candidate\" sessions, which are similar in structure to debates, in Uganda. Our project complements and seeks to build upon these studies. This study seeks to help fill this gap. The project involves an opportunity to conduct a field experiment on the effects of parliamentary debates on voter preferences in the run-up to Ghana's general elections on 7th December 2016. The debates are being organized by the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD), a leading civil society organization in Ghana. As we are primarily interested in understanding how and why debates impact voters' political preferences, and we aim to conduct in-depth qualitative research on the campaigns in our study areas, we are working in three constituencies, collecting a range of detailed descriptive and experimental data from a sample of roughly 2,000 citizens. The study has two broad objectives: 1) to study the impact of debates on voters' evaluations of candidates and their attitudes towards democracy; and 2) to study the impact of debates on the downstream performance of elected candidates during their terms in office. This pre-analysis plan focuses on the first goal. This project is being funded by the International Growth Centre (IGC) and APSA Centennial Center. The study has IRB approval from George Washington University and UCLA.", "q16": "H1: Debates have a positive effect on voters' evaluations of candidates who participate in the debates.

In each constituency, we worked with our partner organization to record the parliamentary debates that took place in that constituency. We sample electoral areas within constituencies (stratifying on electoral competition) to serve as sampling locations for the study. Within electoral areas, individual participants are randomly sampled. Individual participants will be randomly assigned to a debate treatment or a control (placebo) condition. In order to test mechanisms, we \"unbundle\" the debate treatment, which will allow us to experimentally test hypotheses about the potential mechanisms linking debates to outcomes. To do so, we divide the debates into two segments. The first segment, segment A, will focus on candidate background and qualifications. The debate moderator will ask each candidate to describe their personal background, qualifications, and values. This segment will thus allow candidates to discuss the characteristics that they believe make them high quality candidates and to convey to voters information about their personality and character. The second segment, segment B, will focus on the candidates policy and programmatic positions. The debate moderator will ask each candidate to discuss their positions on two salient policy areas: education and unemployment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions. The unit of randomization is at the level of the individual participant. The conditions are: Segment A (candidate image), Segment B (policy), Segment A+B (video), Segment A+B (audio), Control.

Which heuristics, then, do voters utilize when making decisions in primary elections? This survey experiment will utilize a conjoint analysis design to estimate the marginal effects of five factors which the literature suggests can influence voting decisions in primaries: gender, strategic general election considerations, ideology, party endorsements, and previous political experience. Prior to presenting respondents with profiles of two candidates running in a hypothetical open-seat U.S. House election, we will ask questions designed to measure the respondent\u2019s attitudes toward both government and party institutions. We hypothesize that respondents who are less trusting of those institutions will be less likely to choose the more \u201cestablishment\u201d-style candidate. While some scholars have pointed to voters\u2019 risk tolerance to explain support for outsider candidates (Kam and Simas 2012), this study will build on the preliminary work of Dyck, Pearson-Merkowitz, and Coates (2018) to assess the effect of distrust toward government and party institutions on support for party outsiders."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Voters who indicate less trust toward government institutions and/or their own parties in part one of the survey will be more likely to support candidates who have the traits of an outsider in part two. H2: Democratic respondents will exhibit more trust in institutions and be more supportive of establishment-style candidates than Republicans. Alternative hypotheses: We will test four alternative theories for voters\u2019 decisions in primary elections. First, some scholars argue that gender shapes perceptions of ideology and candidate quality. On this view, we might expect Democrats to be more supportive of women regardless of their trust in government, while Republicans would be less supportive of women regardless of trust. Second, we will randomize whether or not the House district is likely to be competitive in the general election. Perhaps voters value quality and electability indicators like endorsements, ideology, and political experience to a greater extent if they want to maximize the chance of winning the seat in the general election. Third, perhaps voters who turn out to vote in primary elections (especially open seat races) seek to elect the most liberal or the most conservative candidate possible, regardless of their feelings towards institutions. Fourth scholars of political parties have argued that in low-information elections, endorsements from party elites can serve as a quality signal for voters. On this view, voters should be more likely to support a candidate if they see that their party\u2019s congressional committee or a high-ranking elected official has endorsed that candidate."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "After collecting demographic information, we will gauge subjects\u2019 trust in government and party institutions by asking how often they trust the following to represent the public\u2019s best interests: Congress, the Supreme Court, the federal government, the president, Republican Party leaders, Democratic Party leaders, etc. Subjects will then indicate their preferences for candidates in hypothetical U.S. House primary elections for the party matching their reported party identification.

While some scholars have pointed to voters\u2019 risk tolerance to explain support for outsider candidates (Kam and Simas 2012), this study will build on the preliminary work of Dyck, Pearson-Merkowitz, and Coates (2018) to assess the effect of distrust toward government and party institutions on support for party outsiders.", "q16": "H1: Voters who indicate less trust toward government institutions and/or their own parties in part one of the survey will be more likely to support candidates who have the traits of an outsider in part two. H2: Democratic respondents will exhibit more trust in institutions and be more supportive of establishment-style candidates than Republicans. Alternative hypotheses: We will test four alternative theories for voters\u2019 decisions in primary elections. First, some scholars argue that gender shapes perceptions of ideology and candidate quality. On this view, we might expect Democrats to be more supportive of women regardless of their trust in government, while Republicans would be less supportive of women regardless of trust. Second, we will randomize whether or not the House district is likely to be competitive in the general election. Perhaps voters value quality and electability indicators like endorsements, ideology, and political experience to a greater extent if they want to maximize the chance of winning the seat in the general election. Third, perhaps voters who turn out to vote in primary elections (especially open seat races) seek to elect the most liberal or the most conservative candidate possible, regardless of their feelings towards institutions. Fourth scholars of political parties have argued that in low-information elections, endorsements from party elites can serve as a quality signal for voters. On this view, voters should be more likely to support a candidate if they see that their party\u2019s congressional committee or a high-ranking elected official has endorsed that candidate.", "q17": "After collecting demographic information, we will gauge subjects\u2019 trust in government and party institutions by asking how often they trust the following to represent the public\u2019s best interests: Congress, the Supreme Court, the federal government, the president, Republican Party leaders, Democratic Party leaders, etc. Subjects will then indicate their preferences for candidates in hypothetical U.S. House primary elections for the party matching their reported party identification. Following a conjoint analysis design, candidate attributes will vary randomly across age, gender, race, district competitiveness, occupation, previous political experience, ideology, and endorsements. Subjects will each review five candidate pairings. We will estimate the average marginal component effect of each of these causal quantities of interest in order to test our hypotheses. We will also perform subgroup analyses among high- and low-trust respondents and among Democratic and Republican respondents.", "q18": "United States", "q19": "1,200", "q20": "No", "q21": "", "q22":

The current protocol will exclude any participants who have a history of chronic illness, including but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, neuromuscular disorder, and orthopedic injury or medication that would preclude participation in this study. In addition, participants with a low back injury or low back pain (within 6 months) will be excluded from the study.\n\nParticipants will be instructed to wear appropriate exercise attire. Participants will be required to complete the study between 9:00AM and 5:00PM on weekdays. The study will commence in the Fall of 2017.\n\nRecruitment\n\nInitial contact and participant selection will be made via flyers and through graduate students working with the principal investigators. \n\nR1. The research will be described in recruitment materials as a study assessing vocalisation techniques in the context of exercise and well being, with clear guidance that some participants will be asked to swear out loud as part of the procedure. \n\nR2. Participants will be instructed to wear appropriate exercise attire for all sessions (e.g., shorts, t-shirt, jog bra) and will be required to complete the study between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on weekdays.\n\nR3. Participants will be asked to complete a health status questionnaire as part of the \nscreening for eligibility process. \n\nProcedure\n\nA test schedule document will summarize the steps to be followed, provide space to record data and it will have several versions that will facilitate randomization of the order in which the exercises are to be completed in the circuit for each participant AND condition order for each participant (i.e., swearing vs. neutral word).\n\nP1. Upon entering the laboratory, all participants will be briefed on the procedures related to the study and will complete an informed consent, which will be witnessed and formally recorded. Once the consent has been signed and witnessed, participants will be asked if they have any questions regarding the study.\n\nP2. Participants will be instructed on how to position a chest strap of a heart rate monitor beneath their clothing. They will then be instructed that they will be able to wear a t-shirt over the chest strap for the duration of the study. If necessary, they will be told to go to the restroom to put on the strap and monitor.\n\nP3. Resting Heart Rate - After returning to the lab, participants will be asked to sit quietly in a chair for 5 mins 30 secs. Resting heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the final 30 seconds of the 5-minute rest period. Data will be recorded on the data input sheet.\n\nP4. After this recording, participants will be asked to nominate a swear word (\u201cA word that you might say if you accidentally injured yourself\u201d) and a neutral word (\u201cA word that you might use to describe a table\u201d). These words will be recorded by the investigator.\n\nP5. Participants will practice the three exercises to be performed with guidance and feedback from the tester until they understand what is entailed and can do each exercise without input from the tester.\n\nP6. Participants will be asked to repeat their first word (i.e., swearing vs. neutral word) for 20s while sitting before being directed to complete one circuit comprising the three exercises in which the word is repeated every 3s for each exercise. The tester will record the outputs for each exercise (time position held for Plank &amp; Wall Sit; number of repetitions completed for Push Ups.)\n\nP7. Participants will take a 2 minute recovery between each exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure will also be recorded during the recovery period. During this rest period they will be asked to complete the Borg Perceived Pain scale and the Engeser (2016) Flow Short Scale 10Qs.\n\nP8. Participants will be given 5 minutes to rest between circuits of exercise and then the protocol will be repeated.\n\nP9. Participants will be randomized to exercise order and swearing condition. and will repeat Steps P6 &amp; P7 for the other word, depending on condition order.\n\nP10. Participants have the opportunity to retire to a rest room to remove the chest strap. Participants will be thanked and debriefed including the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nExercise Procedure and Scoring\n\nPlank\n\nThe plank test measures core endurance. The aim of the plank assessment is to have the participant hold an elevated position for as long as possible. The plank begins with the upper body supported off the ground by the elbows and forearms, and the legs straight with the weight taken by the toes. The hip is lifted off the floor creating a straight line from head to toe. As soon as the subject is in the correct position, the stopwatch is started. The test is over when the subject is unable to hold the back straight and the hip is lowered.\n\nScore will be determined by the total time completed at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task is a flat clean surface, a floor mat, and a stopwatch.\n\nPush Up\n\nThe push-up (also called the press up) measures upper body strength and endurance. The push up test begins with the participant\u2019s hands and toes touching the floor, the body and legs are in a straight line, feet slightly apart, the arms at shoulder width apart, extended and at a right angle to the body. Keeping the back and knees straight, the participant will be instructed to lower the body to a 4-inch foam block that is placed under the chest (located at the costal arch and above the Zyphoid bone). The participant will be instructed to lower their body until they slightly compress the foam cube, and until the arms are at least parallel to the floor, then they will push up again to the original position.\n\nThe back must be kept straight, and in each extension up, the elbows should lock. Resting is allowed, though only in the up (starting) position. This action will be repeated, and the test will continue until the participant can no longer keep their initial form, until exhaustion, or when they request to stop.\n\nScore will be determined by the total number of repetitions completed at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task includes a flat clean surface, a 4-inch yoga block, and a floor mat.\n\nWall Sit\n\nThe wall sit measures the strength endurance of the lower body, particularly the quadriceps. To begin the test, participants will be instructed to stand comfortably with feet approximately shoulder width apart, with their back against a smooth vertical wall. The feet will be placed about 6 inches apart, 1.5 to 2 feet away from the wall, and parallel to one another. Participants will then slowly slide themselves down the wall to assume a position where both knees and hips are at a 90\u00b0 angle.\n\nScore is determined by the total time that the position was held for at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task includes a smooth wall, and a stopwatch.\n"}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q13": {"extra": [], "value": "The sample size will be N = 120."}, "q14": {"extra": [], "value": "Power calculations have been based on effect sizes for the variable heart rate variability based on data from the previous study (Stephens, Spierer and Katehis, in submission).

The current protocol will exclude any participants who have a history of chronic illness, including but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, neuromuscular disorder, and orthopedic injury or medication that would preclude participation in this study. In addition, participants with a low back injury or low back pain (within 6 months) will be excluded from the study.\n\nParticipants will be instructed to wear appropriate exercise attire. Participants will be required to complete the study between 9:00AM and 5:00PM on weekdays. The study will commence in the Fall of 2017.\n\nRecruitment\n\nInitial contact and participant selection will be made via flyers and through graduate students working with the principal investigators. \n\nR1. The research will be described in recruitment materials as a study assessing vocalisation techniques in the context of exercise and well being, with clear guidance that some participants will be asked to swear out loud as part of the procedure. \n\nR2. Participants will be instructed to wear appropriate exercise attire for all sessions (e.g., shorts, t-shirt, jog bra) and will be required to complete the study between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on weekdays.\n\nR3. Participants will be asked to complete a health status questionnaire as part of the \nscreening for eligibility process. \n\nProcedure\n\nA test schedule document will summarize the steps to be followed, provide space to record data and it will have several versions that will facilitate randomization of the order in which the exercises are to be completed in the circuit for each participant AND condition order for each participant (i.e., swearing vs. neutral word).\n\nP1. Upon entering the laboratory, all participants will be briefed on the procedures related to the study and will complete an informed consent, which will be witnessed and formally recorded. Once the consent has been signed and witnessed, participants will be asked if they have any questions regarding the study.\n\nP2. Participants will be instructed on how to position a chest strap of a heart rate monitor beneath their clothing. They will then be instructed that they will be able to wear a t-shirt over the chest strap for the duration of the study. If necessary, they will be told to go to the restroom to put on the strap and monitor.\n\nP3. Resting Heart Rate - After returning to the lab, participants will be asked to sit quietly in a chair for 5 mins 30 secs. Resting heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the final 30 seconds of the 5-minute rest period. Data will be recorded on the data input sheet.\n\nP4. After this recording, participants will be asked to nominate a swear word (\u201cA word that you might say if you accidentally injured yourself\u201d) and a neutral word (\u201cA word that you might use to describe a table\u201d). These words will be recorded by the investigator.\n\nP5. Participants will practice the three exercises to be performed with guidance and feedback from the tester until they understand what is entailed and can do each exercise without input from the tester.\n\nP6. Participants will be asked to repeat their first word (i.e., swearing vs. neutral word) for 20s while sitting before being directed to complete one circuit comprising the three exercises in which the word is repeated every 3s for each exercise. The tester will record the outputs for each exercise (time position held for Plank &amp; Wall Sit; number of repetitions completed for Push Ups.)\n\nP7. Participants will take a 2 minute recovery between each exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure will also be recorded during the recovery period. During this rest period they will be asked to complete the Borg Perceived Pain scale and the Engeser (2016) Flow Short Scale 10Qs.\n\nP8. Participants will be given 5 minutes to rest between circuits of exercise and then the protocol will be repeated.\n\nP9. Participants will be randomized to exercise order and swearing condition. and will repeat Steps P6 &amp; P7 for the other word, depending on condition order.\n\nP10. Participants have the opportunity to retire to a rest room to remove the chest strap. Participants will be thanked and debriefed including the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nExercise Procedure and Scoring\n\nPlank\n\nThe plank test measures core endurance. The aim of the plank assessment is to have the participant hold an elevated position for as long as possible. The plank begins with the upper body supported off the ground by the elbows and forearms, and the legs straight with the weight taken by the toes. The hip is lifted off the floor creating a straight line from head to toe. As soon as the subject is in the correct position, the stopwatch is started. The test is over when the subject is unable to hold the back straight and the hip is lowered.\n\nScore will be determined by the total time completed at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task is a flat clean surface, a floor mat, and a stopwatch.\n\nPush Up\n\nThe push-up (also called the press up) measures upper body strength and endurance. The push up test begins with the participant\u2019s hands and toes touching the floor, the body and legs are in a straight line, feet slightly apart, the arms at shoulder width apart, extended and at a right angle to the body. Keeping the back and knees straight, the participant will be instructed to lower the body to a 4-inch foam block that is placed under the chest (located at the costal arch and above the Zyphoid bone). The participant will be instructed to lower their body until they slightly compress the foam cube, and until the arms are at least parallel to the floor, then they will push up again to the original position.\n\nThe back must be kept straight, and in each extension up, the elbows should lock. Resting is allowed, though only in the up (starting) position. This action will be repeated, and the test will continue until the participant can no longer keep their initial form, until exhaustion, or when they request to stop.\n\nScore will be determined by the total number of repetitions completed at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task includes a flat clean surface, a 4-inch yoga block, and a floor mat.\n\nWall Sit\n\nThe wall sit measures the strength endurance of the lower body, particularly the quadriceps. To begin the test, participants will be instructed to stand comfortably with feet approximately shoulder width apart, with their back against a smooth vertical wall. The feet will be placed about 6 inches apart, 1.5 to 2 feet away from the wall, and parallel to one another. Participants will then slowly slide themselves down the wall to assume a position where both knees and hips are at a 90\u00b0 angle.\n\nScore is determined by the total time that the position was held for at the first attempt. In the case of a non-fatiguing participant, an upper time limit of 5 minutes will be employed. No credit will be awarded should participants attempt to repeat the procedure within the time limit. Equipment needed to complete this task includes a smooth wall, and a stopwatch.\n", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "The manipulated variable will be swearing vs. non-swearing.

To complete the SIB Study, we will bring together these two strands of work. In children without autism and ID, sleep is also known to influence inhibition. Therefore, we think that inhibition may explain part of the relationship between poor sleep and self-injurious behaviour. We will test this idea by running a plan to improve children\u2019s sleep.

It included the global item, \u2018\u2018How often have you been bullied at school in the last couple of months?\u2019\u2019 Answers were given on a 5-point scale: 0 = not at all, 1 = once or twice, 2 = two or three times a month, 3 = once a week, 4 = several times a week. Children who reported being bullied at least two or three times a month were classified as victims. Stable victims were those who reported being bullied at least two or three times a month at both T1 and T2. Social anxiety was measured using the Social Phobia Screening Questionnaire (modified) with items such as \u2018I find it scary to raise my hand during class\u2019 and \u2018I find it scary to talk to someone I don't know\u2019. The questions were rated on a scale of 1-5 (1 = never and 5 = always). Depression was measured using the Major Depression Disorder Scale with nine items such as \u2018I\u2019m having trouble sleeping\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m very tired\u2019. The questions were rated on a scale of 1-4 (1 = never and 4 = always). The dependent variables include social anxiety and depression. The independent variable is healthy context measured by a reduction in the number of victims across two time points. Age, Gender and Intervention Effect will be included as control variables.

We will distinguish two models, in the first model, adjustment problems (social anxiety and depression) are the dependent variables and reduction in the number of victims (healthy context) is the independent variable. The second model will have three parts, in the first part the interaction between the healthy context and the number of friends will be the predictor of adjustment problems, the interaction between the healthy context and mutual friendships will be the predictor of adjustment problems in the second part and in the final part the interaction between the healthy context and physical proximity with friends will be the predictor of adjustment problems. All the three parts of the second model will be compared to the first one to measure whether any or all of these factors play a moderating role in the relationship between a healthy context and adjustment problems of a stable victim.
