In short, we expect that: \nH3: The level of uniqueness will increase during the three assessments. \nH4: The level of subordinate identities will increase during the three assessments. \n\nBelonging and uniqueness increase identity. In line with the Inclusion Identification Model (IIM; Adams, Meyers, Sekaja, and Versteegen, in prep.), we expect that inclusion (i.e., the feeling of belonging and authentic uniqueness) will increase identification with superordinate and subordinate identities. \nH5: Higher levels of belonging and uniqueness will be associated with higher superordinate identity. \nH6: Higher levels of belonging and uniqueness will be associated with higher subordinate identity.\n\nIdentification increases well-being. Whereas the corona pandemic will probably have a negative effect on life satisfaction and mental health, we expect that stronger superordinate and subordinate group identifications will be associated with better well-being (cf. Adams, et al., in prep.). We hypothesize that: \nH7: Stronger superordinate identity will be associated with higher well-being.\nH8: Stronger subgroup identity will associated with higher well-being. \n\nIdentity mediates the effect of belonging and uniqueness on well-being. The IIM (Adams et al., in prep.) suggests that higher levels of inclusion as conceptualized in ODT (Brewer, 1991) positively predict well-being because of higher superordinate and subordinate group identification. We thus hypothesize: \nH9: The effect of inclusion on well-being will be fully mediated by superordinate and subordinate identities. \n", "q5": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.
