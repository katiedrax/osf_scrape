role does the perception of a rule's functionality play in understanding administrative burdens (i.e., Red Tape)? To what extent can explanations of administrative burdens moderate the way individuals perceive those burdens? A long line of research suggests that individuals perceive administrative burdens in a negative light. In this project we seek to understand what happens to the perception of administrative burdens when the role of those burdens are explained to a survey respondent. Study 2: Are certain administrative burdens less cumbersome than others? Does a preference for a certain type of performance metric influence the way individuals process that information? Study 3: Can the need to justify a performance assessment influence the way respondents process the performance information they will see?", "q16": "(See pre-analysis plan for more in-depth description of hypotheses.) 1. Individuals who see a prompt about a public value will perceive less administrative burden when performing tasks. 2. Individuals who are told to justify a performance assessment will perceive less administrative burden. 3. Individuals who see a public value will interpret less administrative burden in their workplace. 4.
