Approximately 40 million adults in the United States (Bandelow et al., 2015), 8.2 million in the UK (Remes et al., 2016) are affected by anxiety disorders. Apart from its extremely high prevalence rate, anxiety disorders also show high comorbidity with mood disorders such as depression. Around 7.8% of the people in Britain meet the diagnosis criteria for both anxiety and depression (Remes et al., 2016). Epidemiological studies also suggest that onset of these conditions can be as early during adolescence, and women are more susceptible to mood and anxiety disorders than men (McLean et al., 2011; de Lijster et al., 2017). Early development of symptoms without appropriate treatments can lead to long-lasting and severe impairments on functioning and overall quality of life in later stages of life. \n\nOne of the core features of mood and anxiety disorders that causes symptomatic manifestation is distorted cognition. Information from the surrounding environment is twisted and distorted automatically in a negative way, for instance noticing or remembering more bad things over the good ones. This is referred to as negative bias. Negative bias in cognitive processing has been observed among many individuals with psychiatric disorders, especially mood and anxiety disorders. This is illustrated by a recently developed translational task in which anxious and depressed individuals show a bias towards interpreting ambiguous stimuli in a pessimistic light (Alyward et al., 2019). However, the underlying neural processes that drive performance on this task are unknown.\n\nThe amygdala and regions within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) which respond to emotion processing have been found highly activated when depressive or anxious individuals are performing reasoning and judgement tasks (Adhikari, 2014; Tovote et al., 2015; Sah, 2017). This suggests that decision-making is somewhat influenced by emotions, and possibly explained one\u2019s inability to mediate their responses between rewarding outcomes and aversive outcomes. As a consequence, these individuals are more likely to progressively develop the negative affective bias and generalize their negative thinking pattern in responding to events. \n\nGiven the influence of affective bias thinking and judgements, ambiguous information processing is particularly affected. Our brain is more likely to employ a top-down approach to process ambiguous signals as prior knowledge and experiences are needed to aid resolving ambiguity in order to response. \u201cHigher areas\u201d of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex are highly engaged (Yoshida &amp; Ishii, 2006; Etkin et al., 2011). Apart from that, symptomatic individuals of mood and anxiety disorders also appear to engage in emotional processing in the presence of the ambiguous stimuli as they tend to be perceived negatively (Aylward et al., 2019). This leads to pessimistic assessment of future options and then negative rumination. Positive cues become difficult to detect, accumulate and process to reach an objective, or even positive conclusion. While negative cues are manipulated internally in a much faster rate, leading to anticipation of negative outcomes, and biased responses. There have been animal models suggesting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is associated with reward anticipation, cognitive and emotional decision making is highly activated under negative affective state (Bush et al., 2002; Hales et al., 2014; Roelofs et al., 2016). Although a similar neural activation pattern in ACC may possibly be observed in human subjects due to the partial power of outcomes prediction on making judgement, little has been known about the relationship between this region and human affective bias.\n\nThus the purpose of this study is to therefore determine the neural basis of affective processing on the translational measure of affective bias (Aylward et al., 2019; Love et al., 2019) which has been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders. In particular, this is the baseline study of \u2018normative\u2019 processing in healthy individuals prior to testing the impact of mood anxiety disorder on this performance."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "Objective: to investigate the underlying neural mechanism of the interaction between affective bias and information processing in healthy subjects.

Every sound sequence / trial is made of 5 tones, consisting of 4 consecutive identical tones and the 5th sound which could be either identical or different. When it is different, it is delivered in the opposite ear, with the same or a different pitch. Each tone is delivered for 50ms with a delay of 100ms between stimuli. Trials are separated by an 800ms-1000ms time interval. \n\nGlobal sequences are made of trials. Several trials of global standards are presented before a global deviant occurs.

There are 2 types of tones: a mixture of 3 sinusoidal signals of either 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz, or 350, 700 and 1400Hz in Matlab R2016 based on Chennu et al. (2013, 2016). Every sound sequence / trial is made of 5 tones, consisting of 4 consecutive identical tones and the 5th sound which could be either identical or different. When it is different, it is delivered in the opposite ear, with the same or a different pitch. Each tone is delivered for 50ms with a delay of 100ms between stimuli. Trials are separated by an 800ms-1000ms time interval. \n\nGlobal sequences are made of trials. Several trials of global standards are presented before a global deviant occurs. When global standard = local standard, the global standard consists of 5 identical tones; when global standard = local deviant, the global standard is where the same sound is played on the opposite ear as the 5th tone. \n\nFor each block, after the initial presentation of 15 global standards, it is equally likely that a global deviant occurs after 2, 3, or 4 global standards. Overall, there is 73.3% possibility that the trial is a global standard, and 13.3% possibility for either type of global deviant. There are 6 2-consecutive deviants (where 2 global deviants occur consecutively; 3 for each type of deviant) and 2 3-consecutive deviants in each block. Without taking consecutive global deviants into account, there is 76.7% possibility for global standards, and 11.6% for either type of global deviant. \n\nThis is a within-subject design study with the following conditions: \nIn the first 4 blocks, participants are instructed to attend to the sounds played. Factors including the side of presentation (whether the local standards are played in the right or left ear) and block type (whether global standard = local standard) are counterbalanced; \nIn blocks 5-8, participants are trained to use the joystick (both before block 5 and before block 7) to indicate to what extent they think the next trial may be a global deviant. In the first 2 blocks, moving joystick to the foremost indicates the likeliest that the next trial is a global deviant; in the last 2 blocks, moving joystick to the foremost indicates the unlikeliest. \nIn block 9, no global deviants are presented.

The contribution of each direct comparison to the estimation of the network summary effects was calculated according to the combination of the variance of the direct treatment effect and the network structure.\nFor the result of skill and knowledge, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A positive SMD value indicated a greater increase in both of the outcomes.\nThe probability of a mode being ranked was calculated as their surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), which is the percentage of efficacy achieved by an approach compared with an imaginary approach that is always the best without uncertainty (ie, SUCRA 100%). SUCRA provides a hierarchy of treatments and accounts for variance of all relative intervention effects, the SUCRA value is 0 when a treatment is the worst option and 1 when a treatment is the best option. Higher SUCRA scores correspond to better knowledge and skill performance.18 Forest plots represent the results of NMA and summary relative mean effects, 95% confidence intervals and SUCRA for all comparisons together. We summaries values of SUCRA in the two-dimensional scatter plots, which presented the probability of being the best pedagogies in both of knowledge and skill. \nWe used a multivariate random-effects meta-regression with a consistency model, as described by White and colleagues. We assessed potential inconsistencies by comparing deviance and deviance estimates for each comparison between consistency and inconsistency using random-effects design-by-treatment interaction model and node-splitting technique. Statistical significance was considered as p &lt; 0.05 for both analyses.\nNetwork transitivity were executed by visually inspecting tables with study-related characteristics that may modify treatment effects including difference in patient characteristics, study designs, detail of intervention and differences in measurement of outcome.\nWe evaluated whether treatment effects for the two outcomes were robust in multiple meta-regression and  subgroup analyses. The following effect modi\ufb01ers were analyzed by multiple meta-regression model:  fields of disciplines, study designs, educational status, study location and assessment measurement tools. Subgroup analyses were performed with the following variables: fields of disciplines such as medicine or nursing, performing studies in east or west countries, and education scenario in cardiopulmonary or non-cardiopulmonary.\nThe sensitivity analyses of our conclusions were evaluated by analyzing the dataset with the following restrictions: studies without comparison of No intervention,  studies without multiple arms designs, studies with pre-graduated participants and studies without quasi/cluster RCTs. Comparison-adjusted funnel plots and the Begg\u2019s test25 were also conducted for evaluations of publication bias and small study effects.\n", "q19.uploader": []}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=x97y4", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/us/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "us", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "x97y4", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "x97y4", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/n46cu/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "n46cu", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/6vzpn/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "6vzpn", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5c08457ed283380029cf73bf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5c08457ed283380029cf73bf", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/x97y4/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/x97y4/"}}, {"id": "jstx6", "type": "registrations", "attributes": {"title": "Empathy choice in Japanese people \u2013 Replication of Cameron et al.

The survey's intention is to better understand the incentives that firms in North Africa respond to when evaluating whether to engage in elections by funding parties and contributing to them in diverse ways. Facebook is used as a means of recruitment because it is both low-cost and very confidential. Compared to traditional firm surveys, this project is more interested in approximate assessments of firm's political connections as opposed to data on microeconomic performance.", "q16": "The hypotheses reflect the incentives that firms face in deciding whether to support a political party's hypothetical appeal for funds. Appeal vignettes are randomized and shown to respondents in the form of a conjoint experiment, which allows for multiple actors and appeals to be shown to each respondent. The effect to be estimated is the difference in employees' perceptions of appeals that are more or less attractive to the firm in question. In addition to the different types of appeals, which reflect both clientelistic and more reform-minded benefits that a party might bring to a firm, the hypotheses look at pre-treatment covariates that might affect the attractiveness of appeals. These include firm sectoral alignment, firm size and firms' exposure to military clients as this is a significant issue in political economy in the region.", "q17": "The hypotheses are tested by looking at the difference in reported firm response to different sets of appeals for support made by parties.
