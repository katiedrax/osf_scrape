It is the issue that many scholars argue is at the heart of the populist backlash that has recently characterized the Western political landscape.  There is a deep and diverse literature that has explored the sources of resistance to immigration among native citizens.  However, these explorations are often very narrow in scope, with people being polled about their general support for immigration, which specific groups should be allowed to immigrate, and which services they should have access to.  A great deal less is known about how people consider and potentially support different methods of exclusion or removal, such as visa processes, detention, and the use of violent force.  The characterization is similarly limited among political philosophers, with theorists either supporting broad immigration controls or not, or supporting the admitting of some groups or not.  There is little work on whether certain means of immigration control are justified. \n\nThe present work first identifies a key principle \u2013 the principle of proportionality \u2013 that is present in other areas of political philosophy concerning the use of coercive force. It considers how this principle might be applied to immigration control, concluding the following ethical philosophical principle: the more force that is necessary for preventing a migrant from remaining in a country, the less justified such prevention is. We then establish whether this general philosophical principle is supported by citizens. We do so by presenting subjects with experimental vignettes of migrants who failed to obtain a visa to live in the UK, with the level of force necessary to deport the migrant varying. Subjects are asked to decide if and to what extent excluding this migrant is reasonable, helping us evaluate the extent that citizens view force as lowering the justification for excluding a migrant.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-07T19:30:58.402381", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T19:25:57.429537", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": ["Enforcement", "Immigration", "Political Philosophy", "Political Psychology"], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Mollie Gerver and Patrick Lown"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "de826ab41715461d1023f9cfd36579929a768fc7f4805a6b1050ca2e7d103e1f157682ec0c9d93bd42a1f2437c1a850a99a5da7931ba5bf6c412159eead454e8fb941c8565185cb8717bffbb0ed21ff19abd92c900d75d72729e5a5f1a0cf57eaa543d0da3a1cd02eaec979141c004e4a7ccc9abc99f2d5776ad8f79e568aecf8129c84ff3e9148228cda8cb79dfced3", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-07T19:30:58.385527", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Mollie Gerver, Patrick Lown"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "1.\tThere is at least a weak inverse relationship between citizens\u2019 support for exclusion and the extent that force used to bring about this exclusion causes likely harm. \n2.\tThere is at least a weak inverse relationship between citizens\u2019 support for exclusion and the severity of the harm caused from force used to bring about this exclusion. \n3.\tThe more subjects are pro-humanitarian, the less they will support violent means of immigration control.\n4.\tThe more educated subjects are, the less they will support violent means of immigration control.\n5.\tThe subjects that are higher in trait empathy will support violent means of immigration control less. \n6.\tCitizens will be more supportive of lethal force the more an immigrant is perceived as a threat to security.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments.

States use physical violence to force migrants onto planes, at times suffocating them to death or injecting psychiatric drugs into those resisting (Fekete 2005; Weber and Pickering 2013; Gibney 2013). States detain migrants until they agree to leave (Corlett 2003 at 105-111; Blitz et al 2005; Abdi 2005; Webber 2011) and sometimes raid migrants\u2019 homes while they sleep, restraining anyone attempting to flee. States sometimes deny basic necessities to migrants, hoping to encourage them to leave on their own accord (Abdi 2005, Blitz et al 2005) and have begun paying migrants to leave, offering thousands of euros to those agreeing to return home (Gerver 2018a, Dadush 2018, Webber 2011; Omata 2011; Smith 2010). Some states even pay other states to host the migrants they do not desire, as when European states paid Libya to keep migrants within its borders, and Turkey to keep refugees within its borders (Sandel 2012; Gerver 2018b). Most famously, states have begun building thicker, higher, and more numerous walls, increasingly using lethal force against those circumventing these walls (Brown 2010). In some cases, states outsource such force to volunteers, as in the US where minute men patrol the border with guns in hand (Chavez 2006; Vina 2006; Yoxall 2006; Lind and Williams 2016). And when migrants do manage to enter, some states separate parents from their children, making it more difficult for children to defend their rights, giving families additional incentives to avoid entering to begin with. \n\nDespite the diversity of immigration control mechanisms in reality, a consideration of public support for these means of exclusion is conspicuously absent.  Pollsters and researchers rarely ask citizens to indicate which control mechanisms they support, instead focusing on general support for immigration and which categories of migrants they support excluding (Aalberg, et al 2012; Citrin et al 1997; Dustmann and Preston, 2007; Facchini and Mayda 2009; Hainmueller and Hiscox 2010; Harell et al 2012; Johnston et al 2015; Mayda, Anna Maria 2006; Newman et al 2015; Quillian 1995; Scheve and Slaughter 2001; Schildkraut 2011; Sniderman 2002, 2004; Wright and Citrin 2011).  For example, a consistent finding across a number of studies indicates that citizens support immigrants who are highly skilled, have no criminal background, are of certain nationalities and races, and display a high likelihood of assimilation, particularly in terms of speaking the language of the host country (Hainmueller and Hopkins 2015; Turper 2017; Citrin &amp; Sides 2008; Turper 2017, Dustmann and Preston 2007; Hainmueller and Hangartner 2013).  These studies do not address whether citizens who support the exclusion of certain immigrants also support all means of exclusion. \n\nSimilarly, studies addressing whether certain types of citizens are more likely to support immigration do not address whether certain types of citizens are more likely to support certain mechanisms for exclusion (Mayda 2006). For example, studies find that those who are more educated or who hold humanitarian tendencies are more supportive of immigration (Citrin and Sides 2008, Lahav 2004 ) while those holding negative stereotypes or biases about immigrants are less supportive of immigration (Burns and Gimpel 2000, Pe \u0301rez 2010). It remains unclear whether these characteristics predict certain opinions regarding when states ought to use force, detention, payments, and other means of exclusion. \n\nIt is not only social science which overlooks the question of mechanisms for immigration control.  This question is also overlooked in philosophy. Political philosophers focusing on the ethics of immigration controls tend to fall into two camps. The first we call inclusive philosophers, who claim states almost never have a moral right to deny entrance to immigrants (Oberman 2016, Carens 1987), and the second we call exclusionary philosophers, who claim states always or sometimes have a moral right to deny entrance to immigrants (Wellman 2008, Miller 2005, 2016, Gibney 2004, Ypi 2016). Neither camp addresses whether some means of exclusion are unjustified even if the ends are. For example, even if denying visas to potential immigrants is justified, lethally shooting immigrants attempting to arrive may not be. Similarly, even if deporting migrants using force is justified, separating parents from their children need not be. \n\nMore generally, what is missing in discussions in both social science and philosophy is a focus on proportionality. The principle of proportionality, commonly raised in discussions on war and criminal justice, holds that an act which involves far greater harm than justified for a given end is morally impermissible (Gross 1979: 436, Fish 2008, von Hirsch 2005; McMahan 2014 at pages 6-9; May 2007 at ch. 10; McMahan 2016). For example, it is wrong to institute the death penalty for someone who has committed the mere crime of theft, even if this will deter theft, as the end of deterrence does not justify the means of death. Similarly, it is wrong to drop a bomb on a civilian population to end a war, because the means of intentionally killing civilians may be disproportionate to the end of winning the war. Just as killing the thief and civilians is wrong, it might be wrong to use some types of force to compel migrants to leave, even if the ends of compelling migrants to leave is justified. \n\nResearch questions: \nIn light of the need to understand proportionality in immigration, we intend to address four primary questions, the first philosophical and the other three empirical:\n\n1.\tWhat mechanisms for immigration control are morally proportionate?\n2.\tIs there a relationship between citizens\u2019 support for immigration control and the mechanisms used for this control?\n3.\tIs there a relationship between certain characteristics held by citizens (their education level, gender, etc.), or characteristics held by immigrants (education level, gender, etc.) and citizens\u2019 tendency to support certain mechanisms for immigration control?\n4.\tAre there interaction effects between characteristics of citizens, characteristics of immigrants, and the mechanisms of immigration control that citizens support?\n\nWe have already begun philosophical work on the first question, and have considered the plausibility of the following two principles:\n\n1.\tWith some exceptions, the more force used in mechanisms for immigration control, the less justified the immigration control is, all else being equal.  \n2.\tThe use of direct force is either never justified, or only justified when the immigrant in question will directly or indirectly pose a threat to the life or basic necessities of innocent individuals.  \n\nWhile more philosophical analysis will be pursued regarding the plausibility of the above two principles, the goal of the three empirical questions is partly to observe the extent that citizens\u2019 opinions are consistent with these tentative philosophical principles.  Our first hypothesis is that they are to an extent. More specifically, we hypothesize the following:\n\n1.\tThere is at least a weak inverse relationship between citizens\u2019 support for exclusion and the extent that force used to bring about this exclusion causes likely harm. \n2.\tThere is at least a weak inverse relationship between citizens\u2019 support for exclusion and the severity of the harm caused from force used to bring about this exclusion. \n3.\tThe more subjects are pro-humanitarian, the less they will support violent means of immigration control.\n4.\tThe more educated subjects are, the less they will support violent means of immigration control.\n5.\tThe subjects that are higher in trait empathy will support violent means of immigration control less. \n6.\tCitizens will be more supportive of lethal force the more an immigrant is perceived as a threat to security.\n\n\nReferences:\nAalberg, Toril; Iyengar, Shanto and Messing, Solomon (2012) \u2018Who is a \u2018Deserving\u2019 Immigrant?

", "q13": "", "q18": "", "q19": "", "q20": "", "q21": "", "q22": "", "q23": "Theoretical background: \nStates use diverse mechanisms to deport migrants or prevent their entrance. States use physical violence to force migrants onto planes, at times suffocating them to death or injecting psychiatric drugs into those resisting (Fekete 2005; Weber and Pickering 2013; Gibney 2013). States detain migrants until they agree to leave (Corlett 2003 at 105-111; Blitz et al 2005; Abdi 2005; Webber 2011) and sometimes raid migrants\u2019 homes while they sleep, restraining anyone attempting to flee. States sometimes deny basic necessities to migrants, hoping to encourage them to leave on their own accord (Abdi 2005, Blitz et al 2005) and have begun paying migrants to leave, offering thousands of euros to those agreeing to return home (Gerver 2018a, Dadush 2018, Webber 2011; Omata 2011; Smith 2010). Some states even pay other states to host the migrants they do not desire, as when European states paid Libya to keep migrants within its borders, and Turkey to keep refugees within its borders (Sandel 2012; Gerver 2018b). Most famously, states have begun building thicker, higher, and more numerous walls, increasingly using lethal force against those circumventing these walls (Brown 2010). In some cases, states outsource such force to volunteers, as in the US where minute men patrol the border with guns in hand (Chavez 2006; Vina 2006; Yoxall 2006; Lind and Williams 2016). And when migrants do manage to enter, some states separate parents from their children, making it more difficult for children to defend their rights, giving families additional incentives to avoid entering to begin with. \n\nDespite the diversity of immigration control mechanisms in reality, a consideration of public support for these means of exclusion is conspicuously absent.  Pollsters and researchers rarely ask citizens to indicate which control mechanisms they support, instead focusing on general support for immigration and which categories of migrants they support excluding (Aalberg, et al 2012; Citrin et al 1997; Dustmann and Preston, 2007; Facchini and Mayda 2009; Hainmueller and Hiscox 2010; Harell et al 2012; Johnston et al 2015; Mayda, Anna Maria 2006; Newman et al 2015; Quillian 1995; Scheve and Slaughter 2001; Schildkraut 2011; Sniderman 2002, 2004; Wright and Citrin 2011).  For example, a consistent finding across a number of studies indicates that citizens support immigrants who are highly skilled, have no criminal background, are of certain nationalities and races, and display a high likelihood of assimilation, particularly in terms of speaking the language of the host country (Hainmueller and Hopkins 2015; Turper 2017; Citrin &amp; Sides 2008; Turper 2017, Dustmann and Preston 2007; Hainmueller and Hangartner 2013).  These studies do not address whether citizens who support the exclusion of certain immigrants also support all means of exclusion. \n\nSimilarly, studies addressing whether certain types of citizens are more likely to support immigration do not address whether certain types of citizens are more likely to support certain mechanisms for exclusion (Mayda 2006). For example, studies find that those who are more educated or who hold humanitarian tendencies are more supportive of immigration (Citrin and Sides 2008, Lahav 2004 ) while those holding negative stereotypes or biases about immigrants are less supportive of immigration (Burns and Gimpel 2000, Pe \u0301rez 2010). It remains unclear whether these characteristics predict certain opinions regarding when states ought to use force, detention, payments, and other means of exclusion. \n\nIt is not only social science which overlooks the question of mechanisms for immigration control.  This question is also overlooked in philosophy. Political philosophers focusing on the ethics of immigration controls tend to fall into two camps. The first we call inclusive philosophers, who claim states almost never have a moral right to deny entrance to immigrants (Oberman 2016, Carens 1987), and the second we call exclusionary philosophers, who claim states always or sometimes have a moral right to deny entrance to immigrants (Wellman 2008, Miller 2005, 2016, Gibney 2004, Ypi 2016). Neither camp addresses whether some means of exclusion are unjustified even if the ends are. For example, even if denying visas to potential immigrants is justified, lethally shooting immigrants attempting to arrive may not be. Similarly, even if deporting migrants using force is justified, separating parents from their children need not be. \n\nMore generally, what is missing in discussions in both social science and philosophy is a focus on proportionality. The principle of proportionality, commonly raised in discussions on war and criminal justice, holds that an act which involves far greater harm than justified for a given end is morally impermissible (Gross 1979: 436, Fish 2008, von Hirsch 2005; McMahan 2014 at pages 6-9; May 2007 at ch. 10; McMahan 2016). For example, it is wrong to institute the death penalty for someone who has committed the mere crime of theft, even if this will deter theft, as the end of deterrence does not justify the means of death.

In particular, elderly population faces the highest risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19, such that 8 out of 10 deaths caused by COVID-19 in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older (CDC.gov). Avoiding close contact with others by putting physical distance between people, or \u201csocial distancing,\u201d has been considered one of the most effective strategies to slow the spread of coronavirus and is strongly recommended and/or enforced by many nations across the world. While social distancing is critical to stay safe during pandemic, it can also increase risks associated with social isolation and loneliness, especially for older adults who are already vulnerable due to various conditions that prevent them from maintaining close social contacts. In the U.S., for example, older compared to younger adults are more likely to live alone (1) with reduced mobility, and their social circles tend to be smaller due to loss of friends and family (2). Further, they tend to suffer more from social isolation (3) compared to younger counterparts, with often fewer resources to carry out daily activities independently and cope with feelings of loneliness. Feelings of loneliness might also motivate older adults to downplay the importance of social distancing and venture out of their homes to social gatherings, which may expose them to greater dangers of infection during pandemic. Therefore, testing effective psychological interventions that may increase the likelihood for older adults of maintaining social distance while not increasing loneliness is critical. This way, vulnerable older populations are protected from direct threats of infectious disease as well as indirect threats of loneliness and social isolation that may result from measures taken to prevent the spread of virus.\n\nHaving a strong sense of purpose in life, or a set of goals derived from an individual\u2019s core values, has been consistently associated with a wide range of positive health outcomes. Having a higher sense of purpose in life is uniquely associated with increased longevity (4), reduced risk of age-related conditions such as heart diseases (5) and cognitive impairment (6), and healthier lifestyles that are key to wellbeing in old age, including physical activity (7) and the use of preventative health services (8). Importantly, purpose may decrease loneliness and promote receptivity to health messaging. Higher purpose has been associated with less perceived loneliness among older adults (9), though less is known about the causal link. Further, our previous work suggests that purpose in life may increase receptivity to health messages, such that individuals with greater sense of purpose in life showed lower conflict-related neural responses while exposed to health messages, which then predicted the likelihood of them agreeing with the self-relevant health messages (10). Together, evidence suggests that increasing purpose might be an effective strategy to shield older adults from the virus as well as loneliness during times of global pandemic.\n\nThe proposed study will test the effects of purpose in life on loneliness and receptivity to COVID-19 messages in older adults. Study 1 will test the links among individual differences in purpose in life, perceived loneliness, and COVID-19 related responses (i.e., intentions, norms, and beliefs). Study 2, which will be amended to this preregistration after initial rounds of pilot will causally manipulate purpose in life by reminding people of values shared across their social group and test its effects on perceived loneliness and responses to COVID-19 related measures. Age will be tested as a moderator in both studies.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-06T23:26:12.617294", "date_modified": "2020-04-07T17:53:48.522871", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Authors"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "b66a93988ddbdf70c6b7c7ce4cb7eae642f9f3e1e49d5815e178c520069a41faae988e97144a6cb6aa177575a461aba202cb6356d805f1646ff20fe2fc239fa013beaab00d5ea0dd0aa8939703a3913c98ac9688dc6150e90237efe752cd3ada76ca7607071d04b1977fe8d06266dcebcd2c1261524e28bba96ad356f1d9f3ea69db3e5708ef36200ebf4fa9a8ef34f0", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-06T23:26:12.599404", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": "The larger study this preregistration is part of decided to have the same exclusion criteria for all studies that share its dataset.

The updates include: 1) that the team agreed on SOP for exclusions before looking at any data, 2) description of one of the dependent measure that was previously missing is added (loneliness), and 3) license information *****\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is posing a direct threat to the health of millions across the globe. In particular, elderly population faces the highest risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19, such that 8 out of 10 deaths caused by COVID-19 in the U.S. have been in adults 65 years old and older (CDC.gov). Avoiding close contact with others by putting physical distance between people, or \u201csocial distancing,\u201d has been considered one of the most effective strategies to slow the spread of coronavirus and is strongly recommended and/or enforced by many nations across the world. While social distancing is critical to stay safe during pandemic, it can also increase risks associated with social isolation and loneliness, especially for older adults who are already vulnerable due to various conditions that prevent them from maintaining close social contacts. In the U.S., for example, older compared to younger adults are more likely to live alone (1) with reduced mobility, and their social circles tend to be smaller due to loss of friends and family (2). Further, they tend to suffer more from social isolation (3) compared to younger counterparts, with often fewer resources to carry out daily activities independently and cope with feelings of loneliness. Feelings of loneliness might also motivate older adults to downplay the importance of social distancing and venture out of their homes to social gatherings, which may expose them to greater dangers of infection during pandemic. Therefore, testing effective psychological interventions that may increase the likelihood for older adults of maintaining social distance while not increasing loneliness is critical. This way, vulnerable older populations are protected from direct threats of infectious disease as well as indirect threats of loneliness and social isolation that may result from measures taken to prevent the spread of virus.\n\nHaving a strong sense of purpose in life, or a set of goals derived from an individual\u2019s core values, has been consistently associated with a wide range of positive health outcomes. Having a higher sense of purpose in life is uniquely associated with increased longevity (4), reduced risk of age-related conditions such as heart diseases (5) and cognitive impairment (6), and healthier lifestyles that are key to wellbeing in old age, including physical activity (7) and the use of preventative health services (8). Importantly, purpose may decrease loneliness and promote receptivity to health messaging. Higher purpose has been associated with less perceived loneliness among older adults (9), though less is known about the causal link. Further, our previous work suggests that purpose in life may increase receptivity to health messages, such that individuals with greater sense of purpose in life showed lower conflict-related neural responses while exposed to health messages, which then predicted the likelihood of them agreeing with the self-relevant health messages (10). Together, evidence suggests that increasing purpose might be an effective strategy to shield older adults from the virus as well as loneliness during times of global pandemic.\n\nThe proposed study will test the effects of purpose in life on loneliness and receptivity to COVID-19 messages in older adults. Study 1 will test the links among individual differences in purpose in life, perceived loneliness, and COVID-19 related responses (i.e., intentions, norms, and beliefs). Study 2, which will be amended to this preregistration after initial rounds of pilot will causally manipulate purpose in life by reminding people of values shared across their social group and test its effects on perceived loneliness and responses to COVID-19 related measures.

Condition or domain being studied: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common symptomatic, inflammatory and immunological disorder of nasal mucosa results from allergen exposure triggered IgE response. Epidemiology of allergic rhinitis varies according to different factors like genetic constitution, racial differences, socio-economic conditions, chances of exposure to different allergens, sex, growth stages. AR shows high prevalence among developed countries. AR is managed with first and second anti histamines (56%), intra nasal corticosteroids (25%) and mast cell stabilizers (19%). Prolonged usage of these medications is necessary in beating the disease as far as the recurrence is concerned. This may lead to numerous serious health hazards. Studies have shown that negative effects of sedative anti-histamines last to the succeeding day disturbing the day time performance. Therefore, research on it is needed.\n\n6.Participants/population: Participants with all types of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis) regardless of gender, age, etiology, ethnic group, severity, diagnosed with specific criteria (i.e. mention any one of criteria for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis) are eligible for inclusion.
