Participants are randomly assigned to one out of six different vignettes. The vignettes display a realistic \u2013 non judgmental \u2013 newspaper article reporting a public service project (construction and management of a penal institution).

The participants will indicate their rating for the pre-measurement variables after being introduced to both organizations separately. This approach is promising to obtain pretest-posttest comparisons which offer significant advantages regarding the data\u2019s explanatory power as well as regarding the analysis (Aguinis and Bradley 2014).\n\nTo avoid priming or anchoring effects through the pretest-posttest design we integrate a distraction task into the questionnaire. The distraction task contains another experiment which deviates from the study\u2019s focus on legitimacy. Instead, participants receive an announcement from the public organization (ministry of justice, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) specifying the need for voluntary actions in the judicial system of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In this experiment, we varied the gender representativeness within the announcement following Riccucci, Van Ryzin, and Li (2016) and Van Ryzin, Riccucci, and Li (2017), to analyze participant\u2019s willingness to volunteer.

For example, discrepancies have been found in the attitudes of community members and professionals who work closely with offenders (Pickett, Mancini, Mears, &amp; Gertz, 2014).

Within this, it is evidenced that offenders face pervasive stigma within society often characterised by negative stereotypes that convey an image of danger of threat. Thus, when an individual occupies a low-status position in society, they may also be subject to different forms of prejudice (contemptuous or paternalistic; Fiske et al., 2002). Paternalistic prejudice is related to the concept of pity, characterised by feelings of warmth, whereas contemptuous prejudice is related to anger. Due to the lack of research on prejudice towards looked-after children, it will be explored whether contemptuous or paternalistic prejudice best describes participant responses towards this group. Due to the assumption that looked-after children occupy a more low-status position in society than individuals raised within a family setting, it is hypothesised that participants would associate more negative stereotypes with this group as a result of greater social stigma (less warmth and competence; Scott, Reppucci, Atonishak, &amp; DeGennaro, 2006). \n\n2.\tThe individual described as a looked-after child will be deemed more responsible for the described crime and will be judged to be less capable of rehabilitation.\nThis hypothesis is based within research by Garrett (1999) which highlighted how perceptions of looked-after children as \u2018troublesome\u2019 are pervasive in the existing literature. Therefore, it was hypothesised that a suspect described as raised in care would be deemed more responsible for a crime and less capable of rehabilitation. Further to this, Scott et al. (2006) argue that young offenders are increasingly subject to punitive action in the justice system as a result of negative public opinion. Despite this widespread concern, Scott et al. (2006) evidenced how negative public attitudes are often targeted to particular groups within society, being influenced by factors such as race and appearance (how physically mature an individual looks). Thus, it is hypothesised that looked-after children will similarly face more punitive attitudes than an individual raised within a family setting, being judged to be more responsible and less capable of rehabilitation. \n\n3.\tParticipants will report being less comfortable with measures of social distance for the looked-after child.\u00a0\nThis hypothesis is based within research by Clow and Leach (2015) which indicated the need for more research investigating how public perception influences potential behaviour, as opposed to what the public believes the government should be doing. Thus, it is deemed important to explore how physically and psychologically close participants are willing to become to looked-after children. This can be measured by asking questions about how likely it is a participant would rent a house or live on the same street as someone described as a looked-after child (Howard, 2019). Research has indicated that participants (including community corrections officers) who reported desiring greater social distance from an offender were significantly less likely to believe that offenders are inherently good people who are capable of rehabilitation (Helfgott &amp; Gunnison, 2008). Thus, social distance measures are deemed to be an effective way to gauge public opinion towards traditionally stigmatised groups. This is linked to the concept of discrimination in that individuals deemed to hold a lower position in society are more likely to receive negative judgement on social distance measures. Therefore, due to research suggesting that looked-after children are often characterised as \u2018troublesome\u2019, it is hypothesised that participants would be less comfortable with measures of social distance (Garrett, 1999). \n\n4.\tParticipant occupation: Those with experience working within the criminal justice sector will be less likely to assign responsibility to a youth offender than those without, and will believe more so in the potential for rehabilitation.\nWillis, Levenson, and Ward (2010) argued for the importance of research investigating the attitudes of professionals who work closely with offenders. This impacts upon rehabilitative outcomes in that professionals who hold negative attitudes towards offenders are deemed more likely to adopt punitive and confrontational styles in their interactions (Willis et al., 2010). In accordance with this, it was found that displays of empathy and warmth facilitated treatment change and therefore it has been argued that effective rehabilitation partially hinges on the way offenders are regarded by both the public and professionals (Willis et al., 2010). Subsequent to this, it was theorised that having greater contact with offenders would result in more positive attitude ratings towards them, evidencing why students and general community members are generally seen to endorse more negative attitudes than those working with offenders. As a result, it is hypothesised that those with experience working in the criminal justice sector would be less likely to assign responsibility to a youth offender than those without, and would believe more so in the potential for rehabilitation.

This is an effective method of sampling in this case due to this being a variable of interest in investigating the potential influence of occupation. Therefore, sampling participants based upon certain characteristics, knowledge and experience is necessary (Etikan, Musa, &amp; Alkassim, 2016). The decision to use individuals working within the criminal justice system is due to a lack of research being available on this group, with most research regarding opinions towards young offenders being gauged from the general public which inherently fails to gather information from those that work most closely with this group (Willis, Levenson, &amp; Ward, 2010).

This will be averaged into a single index in which high scores indicate a high potential for rehabilitation (question 4 will be reverse scored).

This will be done using a forward stepwise logistic regression (binary logistic function in SPSS). The research question here would thus be to explore what factors predict the likelihood that respondents would assign rehabilitative/ punitive sentencing. \nThe dependent variable here will be the question, \u2018Would you be more likely to support punitive or rehabilitative measures for [the perpetrator]?\u2019, in which participants have a binary response of \u2018punitive\u2019 or \u2018rehabilitative\u2019. \nThe two independent variables will be perpetrator upbringing (looked-after child = 1, family raised = 2) and participant occupation (criminal justice experience = 1, no criminal justice experience = 2). \nAs per hypothesis 2, it is expected that the perpetrator described as a looked-after child will be more likely to receive punitive action. Furthermore, as per hypothesis 4, it is expected that participants with experience working in the criminal justice system will be less likely to assign punitive measures to both groups. \n\nSocial distance:\nSocial distance is measured by 5 questions which will be combined into an overall social distance score (higher scores indicate participants being more comfortable to the perpetrator). \nA hierarchical multiple regression will be conducted to assess the influence of a range of independent variables on the outcome variable (overall social distance score). \nThe independent variables here will include upbringing (whether a perpetrator was described as a looked-after child or raised in a family setting- defined as 1 and 2 respectively), participant occupation (does the participant have experience working in the criminal justice system - Yes = 1, No = 2), participant age (in years) and participant gender (Male = 1, Female = 2, Rather not say = 3, Other = 4). \nThe latter 2 variables will be entered in a first block, whilst participant occupation and perpetrator upbringing will be entered subsequently.

Within this, it is evidenced that offenders face pervasive stigma within society often characterised by negative stereotypes that convey an image of danger of threat. Thus, when an individual occupies a low-status position in society, they may also be subject to different forms of prejudice (contemptuous or paternalistic; Fiske et al., 2002). Paternalistic prejudice is related to the concept of pity, characterised by feelings of warmth, whereas contemptuous prejudice is related to anger. Due to the lack of research on prejudice towards looked-after children, it will be explored whether contemptuous or paternalistic prejudice best describes participant responses towards this group. Due to the assumption that looked-after children occupy a more low-status position in society than individuals raised within a family setting, it is hypothesised that participants would associate more negative stereotypes with this group as a result of greater social stigma (less warmth and competence; Scott, Reppucci, Atonishak, &amp; DeGennaro, 2006). \n\n2.\tThe individual described as a looked-after child will be deemed more responsible for the described crime and will be judged to be less capable of rehabilitation.\nThis hypothesis is based within research by Garrett (1999) which highlighted how perceptions of looked-after children as \u2018troublesome\u2019 are pervasive in the existing literature. Therefore, it was hypothesised that a suspect described as raised in care would be deemed more responsible for a crime and less capable of rehabilitation. Further to this, Scott et al. (2006) argue that young offenders are increasingly subject to punitive action in the justice system as a result of negative public opinion. Despite this widespread concern, Scott et al. (2006) evidenced how negative public attitudes are often targeted to particular groups within society, being influenced by factors such as race and appearance (how physically mature an individual looks). Thus, it is hypothesised that looked-after children will similarly face more punitive attitudes than an individual raised within a family setting, being judged to be more responsible and less capable of rehabilitation. \n\n3.\tParticipants will report being less comfortable with measures of social distance for the looked-after child.\u00a0\nThis hypothesis is based within research by Clow and Leach (2015) which indicated the need for more research investigating how public perception influences potential behaviour, as opposed to what the public believes the government should be doing. Thus, it is deemed important to explore how physically and psychologically close participants are willing to become to looked-after children. This can be measured by asking questions about how likely it is a participant would rent a house or live on the same street as someone described as a looked-after child (Howard, 2019). Research has indicated that participants (including community corrections officers) who reported desiring greater social distance from an offender were significantly less likely to believe that offenders are inherently good people who are capable of rehabilitation (Helfgott &amp; Gunnison, 2008). Thus, social distance measures are deemed to be an effective way to gauge public opinion towards traditionally stigmatised groups. This is linked to the concept of discrimination in that individuals deemed to hold a lower position in society are more likely to receive negative judgement on social distance measures. Therefore, due to research suggesting that looked-after children are often characterised as \u2018troublesome\u2019, it is hypothesised that participants would be less comfortable with measures of social distance (Garrett, 1999). \n\n4.\tParticipant occupation: Those with experience working within the criminal justice sector will be less likely to assign responsibility to a youth offender than those without, and will believe more so in the potential for rehabilitation.\nWillis, Levenson, and Ward (2010) argued for the importance of research investigating the attitudes of professionals who work closely with offenders. This impacts upon rehabilitative outcomes in that professionals who hold negative attitudes towards offenders are deemed more likely to adopt punitive and confrontational styles in their interactions (Willis et al., 2010). In accordance with this, it was found that displays of empathy and warmth facilitated treatment change and therefore it has been argued that effective rehabilitation partially hinges on the way offenders are regarded by both the public and professionals (Willis et al., 2010). Subsequent to this, it was theorised that having greater contact with offenders would result in more positive attitude ratings towards them, evidencing why students and general community members are generally seen to endorse more negative attitudes than those working with offenders. As a result, it is hypothesised that those with experience working in the criminal justice sector would be less likely to assign responsibility to a youth offender than those without, and would believe more so in the potential for rehabilitation.

Social media: Advertisements will be placed on Facebook for voluntary participation within the research study. This allows for snowballing methods of recruitment that can be used to target potential adult participants who meet the inclusion criteria (aged 18 or over).\u00a0\n2. Purposive sampling will be used to identify participants based upon pre-arranged selection criteria that state half of the participant sample should have experience working within the criminal justice sector. This is an effective method of sampling in this case due to this being a variable of interest in investigating the potential influence of occupation. Therefore, sampling participants based upon certain characteristics, knowledge and experience is necessary (Etikan, Musa, &amp; Alkassim, 2016). The decision to use individuals working within the criminal justice system is due to a lack of research being available on this group, with most research regarding opinions towards young offenders being gauged from the general public which inherently fails to gather information from those that work most closely with this group (Willis, Levenson, &amp; Ward, 2010). The criminal justice worker sample will be recruited through speculative applications to police stations within the United Kingdom, within which the lead researcher has some existing contact from previous volunteering work.\nNo payment will be offered to participants in return for completion of the study. \nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study state that participants cannot take part if they are under the age of 18 and not a resident of the United Kingdom. This will be reinforced through the consent and information sheet given to participants. \nThe study timeline is that data collection is expected to begin in April 2020 before closing in July in order to be analysed before the project deadline on August 7th 2020.

Within this, an adolescent perpetrator will be described as either raised in care or within a family setting. \nThe 2 vignettes will be identical except for information describing the perpetrator, in which details regarding their upbringing will be manipulated. For example, the \u2018looked-after\u2019 perpetrator will be described as \u2018raised in foster care\u2019, whereas the other vignette describes the perpetrator as \u2018from a middle-class upbringing\u2019.

This decision was made due to the fact that a large amount of research exploring public attitudes towards offenders has used male perpetrators within stimulus materials (Scott et al., 2006; Howard, 2019). Furthermore, an increasing focus on female perpetration in recent years has highlighted this group to display unique and distinct patterns of criminality (Bloom &amp; Covington, 2001). Thus, the use of a female perpetrator within the vignette in the current study would potentially mean that results aren\u2019t able to be effectively compared with past research on public opinion. Furthermore, due to research suggesting that female offenders may be deemed more \u2018vulnerable\u2019, it is evident that public opinion toward them would differ from that of a male (Zager, 2018). Thus, the aspect of female offending wasn\u2019t included in the present study and may instead be a viable route for future research.

The reasoning for this is to avoid indiscriminateness and also due to research suggesting that age and gender are often not significant predictors in research about public opinion. For example, Katz et al. (2008) found no effect of age on participant judgements of offenders, whereas Clow and Leach (2015), Katz et al. (2008) and Brown (1999) found no significant effect of gender. This assumption was also made due to it being hypothesized that perpetrator upbringing will be more predictive of the dependent variable (as per hypothesis 1). \nThe reasoning for using a multiple regression here is based on the ability to explore how a set of variables is able to predict the outcome as a whole as well as the relative contribution of each variable.

As predicted in hypothesis 4, it is also expected that participants with experience working in the criminal justice system will deem the perpetrator as less responsible.\n\nRehabilitation and discrimination: \nPotential for rehabilitation is measured by 4 questions (1. how likely is the perpetrator to outgrow their behaviour, 2. how likely is it the perpetrator will lead a productive life, 3. how likely is the perpetrator to be rehabilitated, 4. how likely is the perpetrator to commit a future offence). This will be averaged into a single index in which high scores indicate a high potential for rehabilitation (question 4 will be reverse scored). This will be the dependent variable.\nThis will then be assessed using a hierarchical multiple regression to explore the influence of upbringing (whether a perpetrator was described as a looked-after child or raised in a family setting- defined as 1 and 2 respectively), participant occupation (does the participant have experience working in the criminal justice system - Yes = 1, No = 2), participant age (in years) and participant gender (Male = 1, Female = 2, Rather not say = 3, Other = 4).\nThe latter 2 variables will be entered in a first block, whilst participant occupation and perpetrator upbringing will be entered subsequently.

Furthermore, as per hypothesis 4, it is also expected participants with experience working in the criminal justice system will believe more so in the potential for rehabilitation.\n\nParticipant\u2019s choice of sentence for the perpetrator in the vignette will then be predicted from the type of upbringing that is described and the participant\u2019s occupation. This will be done using a forward stepwise logistic regression (binary logistic function in SPSS). The research question here would thus be to explore what factors predict the likelihood that respondents would assign rehabilitative/ punitive sentencing. \nThe dependent variable here will be the question, \u2018Would you be more likely to support punitive or rehabilitative measures for [the perpetrator]?\u2019, in which participants have a binary response of \u2018punitive\u2019 or \u2018rehabilitative\u2019. \nThe two independent variables will be perpetrator upbringing (looked-after child = 1, family raised = 2) and participant occupation (criminal justice experience = 1, no criminal justice experience = 2). \nAs per hypothesis 2, it is expected that the perpetrator described as a looked-after child will be more likely to receive punitive action. Furthermore, as per hypothesis 4, it is expected that participants with experience working in the criminal justice system will be less likely to assign punitive measures to both groups. \n\nSocial distance:\nSocial distance is measured by 5 questions which will be combined into an overall social distance score (higher scores indicate participants being more comfortable to the perpetrator). \nA hierarchical multiple regression will be conducted to assess the influence of a range of independent variables on the outcome variable (overall social distance score). \nThe independent variables here will include upbringing (whether a perpetrator was described as a looked-after child or raised in a family setting- defined as 1 and 2 respectively), participant occupation (does the participant have experience working in the criminal justice system - Yes = 1, No = 2), participant age (in years) and participant gender (Male = 1, Female = 2, Rather not say = 3, Other = 4). \nThe latter 2 variables will be entered in a first block, whilst participant occupation and perpetrator upbringing will be entered subsequently.

This assumption was also made due to it being hypothesized that perpetrator upbringing will be more predictive of the dependent variable (as per hypothesis 3). \nAs per hypothesis 3, it is expected that participants will report being less comfortable with measures of social distance for the looked-after child.\u00a0", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48", "text":
