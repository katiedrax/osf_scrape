That is, one may feel one is, or is not, a definite person, right now; and one may also feel that one is, or is not, the same person now, as one has been in the past, or will be in the future. \n\nSuch degrees of identity manifestation are interesting to characterize in themselves. In addition, such degrees of identity manifestation are liable to have interesting psychological correlates, causes, and consequences that are worth investigating.\n\nThe present study does not so much test a hypothesis as conduct an initial psychometric evaluation, namely, of provisional versions of several self-report instruments designed to capture two dimensions of identity manifestation (IM), namely, synchronic identity (SI) and diachronic identity (DI). These instruments fall into three classes. The first class involves philosophical quotations (PQs). The second class involves visual analogues (VAs). And the third class involves conventional questionnaires (CQs). The PQs consists of quotations from philosophers David Hume and Galen Strawson, articulating the absence of SI and DI respectively, with which participants can express agreement or disagreement, using 7 response options. The VAs consist of head silhouettes\u2014defined more or less vaguely, or containing larger or smaller interrogation marks\u2014with which participants indicate their level of identification (SI); and of a selection of circle pairs, differing in their degree of overlap, representing respectively either the past and the present, or the present and the future\u2014with which participants indicate their level of identification (DI). All VA items feature 7 response options. The CQs consist of a 24-item scale, designed to capture SI, and a 16-item scale, designed to capture DI, which participants can describe as being true or false, using 7 response options. In addition, whereas the DI scale is intended to be unifactorial, capturing the felt impermanence of self with all 16 items, the SI scale is intended to be multifactorial, such that the felt irreality of synchronic identity reflects felt indefiniteness, felt inscrutability, felt impressibility, and felt impersonability, each facet being captured by 6 items. Level of identity manifestation on all items will be scaled from 0 to 6.\n\nIn particular, the various identity manifestation instruments will be administered for the first time to a sizable sample of participants. From the data they provide, all the items composing them will be evaluated in terms of their (a) individual discriminative power, (b) individual coherence with their overall scale and their associated subscales, (c) tendency to cohere collectively into a single construct and their associated subconstructs. Also assessed will be (d) the tendency for different types of scale assessing the same construct (i.e., SI and DI) to correlate preferentially with another, alongside the emergence of a general positive manifold. On the basis of meeting, or not meeting, standard criteria in this regard, items will be retained or discarded/amended, to produce revised IM instruments.\n\nOther studies in this line of research will do the following:\n\n- Have revised IM items rated for the clarity and validity of their content.\n- Confirm the factor structure of the revised IM instruments.\n- Assess the internal consistency of the revised IM instruments.\n- Assess the test-retest reliability of the revised IM instruments.\n- Assess the measurement invariance of the revised IM instruments across different groups.\n- Validate the revised IM instruments both convergently and discriminantly.\n- Validate the revised IM instruments both concurrently and predictively.\n- Assess the extent to which social desirability contributes to scores on the revised IM instruments.\n- Test for the existence, strength, and direction of theoretically interesting correlates of the revised IM instruments.\n\nIn the present study, we will also, for the sake of conducting an undergraduate student project, include additional measures\u2014all administered the provisional IM instruments.   \n\nSome of these measures will assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the provisional IM instruments their items in a preliminary and exploratory way\u2014with the possibility of the findings nonetheless being used diagnostically in a supplementary capacity. \n\nThe link between the scores on IM instruments  and \"dark\" personality traits will be explored. So too will their link to the \"Big Five\" Personality traits (Extraversion, Stability, Conscientiousness, Agreebleness, and Openness). On theoretical grounds, we expect to find that lesser degrees of IM, on both SI and DI, will be positively associated with \"dark\" personality traits, although more so for Machiavellianism and Psychopathy than for Narcissism. In addition, we expect to find that lesser degrees of IM, of both SI and DI, will be associated with lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness (the \"darker\" traits). We also we expect to find that lesser degrees of IM, of both SI and DI, will be associated with lower Stability (instability of self-concept) and greater openness (plasticity of self-concept), but higher Extraversion wil predict greater degree of IM, of both SI and DI.\n\n\"Dark\" personality traits will be operationalized by whole scale and subscale scores on the  12-item Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD), which features subscales for Machiavellianism, Psychopathy, and Narcissism.\n\n[Jonason, P, K. &amp; Webster, G, D.

However\u2014together with other types of so-called \u201cdark\u201d personalities, such as narcissism and Machiavellianism\u2014a prominent feature of the construct is that it arguably involves several species of not caring about one or more things that are typically cared about by normal individuals\u2014such as the future, the truth, or other people. This lack of caring\u2014here labelled pococurantism (Italian: \"little-caring\")\u2014remains under-theorized, despite the fact that it may pick out, not only a conceptually coherent and empirically tractable feature of dark personalities, but a unifying and essential feature too. In addition, pococurantism may be a construct whose correlates, causes, and effects could be profitably examined in their own right, free from the conceptual baggage and historical controversy that has dogged the conceptual conundrum that is psychopathy. Unsurprisingly, there does not yet exist any instrument designed to assess individual differences in pococurantism, either overall or in specific domains. The current research is designed to remedy this deficit, and to permit thereby theoretical and empirical progress to be made in the field of psychopathy and dark personality.\n\nThe present study does not so much test a hypothesis as conduct an initial psychometric evaluation, namely, of a provisional version of a self-report instrument designed to capture the key construct in question: the Lack of Caring Inventory (LOCI).  As its name suggests, this inventory is designed to assess, reliably and durably, individual differences in the dispositional inclination to not care about things, that is, pococurantism, whose logical opposite is \"moltocurantism\" (Italian: \"much-caring\"). In addition, pococurantism is assessed in three ontologically and psychologically distinct domains: the future (i.e., a lack of prudence); the truth (i.e., a lack of veracity); and other people (i.e., a lack of empathy). \n\nIn its provisional form, the LOCI consists of 21-item scale, each item consisting of a pair of bipolar alternatives at opposite ends of a continuous scale, linear and horizontal. Participants move a slider from left to right to indicate their degree of relative agreement with one alternative versus the other, the slider's position always reflecting a relative preference for saving (more rightward) versus spending (more leftwards). The slider moves smoothly, and affords the respondent a 101-point resolution, scaled from +50 (most caring: \"moltocurante\") through 0 through -50 (least caring: \"pococurante\"). \n\nThe 21-item scale is also divided into three subscales, of 7 items each, each tapping to one of the key domains in which pococurantism is expressed, namely, the future, the truth, and other people. In addition, items tapping each domain cyclically recur every three items; and different expressions, capturing a lack of caring or abundance of caring, are counterbalanced across various items, but such that none is used across adjacent items. Finally, to maximize the construct-related variability, and hence the discriminative power, of each item, phrasing is used that encourages agreement with the pococurante pole (by using adverbs reflecting candor) and discourages agreement with the moltocurante pole (by using absolutist language), given that normative pressure might be expected to do the opposite.\n\nIn particular, the inventory will be administered for the first time to a sizable sample of participants. From the data they provide, all the items composing the provisional LOCI will be evaluated in terms of their (a) individual discriminative power, (b) individual coherence with the overall scale and their associated subscales (c) tendency to cohere collectively into a single construct and associated their subconstructs. On the basis of meeting, or not meeting, standard criteria in this regard, items will be retained or discarded/amended, to produce a revised LOCI.\n\nOther studies in this line of research will do the following:\n\n- Have revised LOCI items rated for the clarity and validity of their content.\n- Confirm the factor structure (one general factor, three specific factors) of the revised LOCI.\n- Assess the internal consistency of the revised LOCI and its three subscales.\n- Assess the test-retest reliability of the revised LOCI and its three subscales.\n- Assess the measurement invariance of the revised LOCI across different groups.\n- Validate the revised LOCI, and its three subscales, both convergently and discriminantly.\n- Validate the revised LOCI, and its three subscales, both concurrently and predictively.\n- Assess the extent to which social desirability contributes to scores on the revised LOCI, and its subscales.\n- Test for the existence, strength, and direction of theoretically interesting correlates of the revised LOCI, and its subscales.\n\nIn the present study, we will also, for the sake of conducting undergraduate student projects, include additional measures\u2014all administered after the provisional LOCI.  \n\nSome of these measures will assess the convergent and (partly) discriminant validity of the provisional LOCI, its subscales, and its items in a preliminary and exploratory way\u2014with the possibility of the findings nonetheless being used diagnostically in a supplementary capacity. \n\nFirst, the link between the scores on the LOCI and \"dark\" and \"light\" personality traits will be explored. On theoretical ground,s we suspect that whole scale and subscale scores on the LOCI should be positively associated with \"dark\" personality traits, and negatively associated with scores on \"light\" personality traits. For example, key indices of a psychopathic personality include self-defeating impulsivity (not caring about the future), pathological lying (not caring about the truth), and a lack of empathy (not caring about other people\u2014all characteristics assessed by the LOCI. Conversely, non-psychopaths should be prudent, tell the truth, and be abundant in fellow-feeling.\n\n\"Dark\" personality traits will be operationalized by whole scale and subscale scores on the 12-item Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD), which features subscales for Machiavellianism, Psychopathy, and Narcissism.\n\n[Jonason, P, K. &amp; Webster, G, D. (2010). The Dirty Dozen: A concise measure of the dark triad. Psychological Assessment, 22, 420-432.]\n\n\"Light\" personality traits will be operationalized by whole scale and subscale scores on the Light Triad Scale (LTS), which features subscales for Faith in Humanity, Humanism, and Faith in Humanity.\n\n[Kaufman, S. B.. Yaden, D. B., Hyde, E, &amp; Tsukayama, E. (2019). The light vs. dark triad of personality: Contrasting two very different profiles of human nature. Frontiers in Psychology, 10, A467. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467] \n\nFurther pairs of items will directly assess, respectively, participants' temporal discounting rate (i.e., indifference towards the future); their proclivity towards lying (i.e., indifference towards veracity); and their (lack of ) dispositional agreeableness (i.e., indifference towards other people). We suspect that each of these will correlate with whole scale LOCI scores, as well as showing the theoretically expected pattern of preferential correlation with the LOCI subscales\n\nIn addition, a novel 6-item scale entitled the Priority of Promising Scale (POPS) will be included, which assesses the extent to which people morally prioritize promising-keeping. Participants read vignettes in which a promisor breaks or keeps a promise to a promisee, where the promisor and promisee are either self and another person, another person and self, or two hypothetical people. It permits both the moral prioritization of promising-keeping, and a self-serving bias the moral prioritization of promising-keeping, to be independently assessed. As making a promise involves a commitment to a course of action undertaken later (i.e., not being indifferent to the future), the performance of speech act that accords with reality (i.e., not being indifferent to the truth), and a promisee whose welfare is on the line if the promise is broken (i.e., not being indifferent to others), we suspect that pococurantism and its subscales should be inversely correlated with the moral prioritization of promising-keeping.\n\nIn the present study, we will also collect standard demographic information on participants. In particular, this will include gender, age, national identity, and English fluency.

As making a promise involves a commitment to a course of action undertaken later (i.e., not being indifferent to the future), the performance of speech act that accords with reality (i.e., not being indifferent to the truth), and a promisee whose welfare is on the line if the promise is broken (i.e., not being indifferent to others), we suspect that pococurantism and its subscales should be inversely correlated with the moral prioritization of promising-keeping.\n\nIn the present study, we will also collect standard demographic information on participants.

Furthermore, these individual differences are liable to be correlates, causes, or consequences of many other important phenomena. However, there currently exists no instrument designed to assess this individual difference specifically. This is the first study in a line of research designed to remedy the deficiency.\n\nThe present study does not so much test a hypothesis as conduct an initial psychometric evaluation, namely, of a provisional version of a self-report instrument designed to capture the key construct in question: the Save Or Spend Scale (SOSS).  As its name suggests, this scale is designed to assess, reliably and durably, individual differences in the dispositional and domain-general preference for saving versus spending.\n\nIn its provisional form, the SOSS consists of 20-item scale, each item consisting of a pair of bipolar alternatives at opposite ends of a continuous scale, linear and horizontal. Participants move a slider from left to right to indicate their degree of relative agreement with one alternative versus the other, the slider's position always reflecting a relative preference for saving (more rightward) versus spending (more leftwards). The slider moves smoothly, and affords the respondent a 101-point resolution, scaled from +50 (maximal saving preference) through 0 (no preference) through -50 (maximal spending preference). Thus, higher scores indicate a relative preference for saving.\n\nIn particular, the scale will be administered for the first time to a sizable sample of participants. From the data they provide, all the items composing the provisional SOSS will be evaluated in terms of their (a) individual discriminative power, (b) individual coherence with the overall scale, and (c) tendency to cohere collectively into a single construct. On the basis of meeting, or not meeting, standard criteria in this regard, items will be retained or discarded/amended, to produce a revised SOSS.\n\nOther studies in this line of research will do the following:\n\n- Have revised SOSS items rated for the clarity and validity of their content\n- Confirm the factor structure (unifactorial) of the revised SOSS.\n- Assess the internal consistency of the revised SOSS.\n- Assess the test-retest reliability of the revised SOSS.\n- Assess the measurement invariance of the revised SOSS across different groups.\n- Validate the revised SOSS both convergently and discriminantly.\n- Validate the revised SOSS both concurrently and predictively.\n- Assess the extent to which social desirability contributes to scores on the revised SOSS.\n- Test for the existence, strength, and direction of theoretically interesting correlates of the revised SOSS .\n\nIn the present study, we will also, for the sake of an undergraduate student project, include an additional four items in the study\u2014all administered after the provisional SOSS. These items will assess the convergent validity of the provisional SOSS and its items in a preliminary and exploratory way\u2014with the possibility of the findings nonetheless being used diagnostically in a supplementary capacity. These items will assess, respectively, participants' temporal discounting rate (1 item); whether they are dispositionally more approach-oriented or avoidance-oriented (1 item); and whether they show behavioral signs of spending (1 item) or saving (1 item). We suspect that that scores on the SOSS scale and its items will correlate positively with a lower temporal discount rate, being more avoidance-oriented than approach-oriented, and having savings as opposed to being maxed out on a credit card.\n\nIn the present study, we will also collect standard demographic information on participants.

whether scores on the Impersonal Index will be higher or lower on average that scores on the Self and Other indices. We suspect that they may fall in between. \n\nWe do predict that scores on the Self, Other, and Impersonal indices will be modestly positively correlated. However, but make no prediction as regards the relative magnitude of these correlations. We suspect, however, that the First and Second Impersonal indices will be better correlated with each other, than the Self, Other, and Impersonal indices are correlated among one another. In addition, we suspect that the correlation between the Self and Other will be mediated by the Impersonal Index, the rationale being that a general commitment to promising should be the main reason why a felt obligation to other to the self, and felt obligations of the self to the other\u2014felt obligations that might be expected to at least partly oppose one another\u2014should correlate at all.\n\nWe also also conduct exploratory analyses with a series of demographic variables (e.g., gender, age) to see if they moderate the magnitude of the self-serving bias in the moral prioritization of promise-keeping. We make no predictions here, and suspect null effects.\n\nIn addition, the measures described here will be administered alongside a few others as part of the same data collection. The correlational links between the indices derived from both sets of measures will be examined in an exploratory way, but guided by plausible theoretical rationales, as a prelude to later more rigorous testing in a standard hypothetico-deductive way.\n\nIn particular, the data collection will featuring the first administration\u2014to assess its psychometric merits (e.g., item discrimination, item coherence, factor structure, internal consistency)--of a candidate inventory to assess the construct of Pococurantism.

In particular, the 21-item inventory\u2014provisionally entitled the Lack of Caring Inventory (LOCI)\u2014will assess this tendency as it manifests itself in respect of three very general but discrete domains: the Future; the Truth, and Other People. Furthermore, the data collection will feature the administration of three 2-item measures designed respectively to assess respondents'  temporal discounting rate, lying proneness, and dispositional disagreeableness. \n\nAlthough the POPS and the LOCI will not yet be fully validated, and although the two-items measures represent only brief operationalization of their respective constructs, it is nonetheless predicted that indices derived from the LOCI\u2014reflective of Pococurantism\u2014will correlate negatively with both the Impersonal Indices (reflecting the moral prioritization of promise-keeping) but positively with the Self-Serving index (reflecting the self-serving bias in the moral prioritization of promise-keeping).

The rationale for the latter prediction is that, when it comes to indifference, others are more liable to be recipients of it than the self.

In particular, it is hypothesized that people will regard others as under a greater moral obligation to keep promises to them, than they are to keep promises to others. The rationale for this hypothesis is that this would be consistent with a range of self-serving biases.\n\nA secondary hypothesis being tested is that the magnitude of this self-serving bias will be moderated by personality traits. In particular, the more people exhibit \"dark\" personality traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism), and the less they exhibit \"light\" personality traits (faith in humanity, humanism, Kantianism), the stronger the self-serving bias will be. The rationale is that promising-keeping and promise-breaking are commonplace phenomena in everyday life, that should be partly explicable in terms of variations in people's general prosocial or antisocial dispositions. In addition, it will be investigated whether, for participants with the least \"dark\" and most \"light\" personalities, the self-serving bias will disappear or even reverse. The rationale here is that the nicest, most decent people may actually hold themselves to higher moral standards than they hold others to.\n\nA third hypothesis being tested is that the moral prioritization of promise-keeping, above and beyond the self-serving bias, will be inversely correlated with the magnitude of that self-serving bias. The rationale is that, to the extent to which promise-keeping is a regarded as a moral priority, it will be regarded as equally and objectively binding on everyone.\n\nA fourth hypothesis being tested is that the moral prioritization of promise-keeping, above and beyond the self-serving bias, will be inversely correlated with \"dark\" personality traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism), and positive correlated with \"light\" personality traits (Faith in Humanity, Humanism, Kantianism).

SUMMARY\nThe neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role in several cognitive domains such as motivation, reward-processing, reinforcement learning, decision-making and executive functions including working memory and attention (Arnsten, Wang, &amp; Paspalas, 2012; Logue &amp; Gould, 2013; Rogers, 2011; Schultz, 2002; Volkow, Wise, &amp; Baler, 2017). Results of our recent studies point towards prominent alterations in these domains in overweight and obesity and suggest the existence of a non-linear relationship between markers of obesity and central dopamine tone (Horstmann, Fenske, &amp; Hankir, 2015). Dopamine tone in the brain depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Via epigenetic mechanisms, environmental factors may directly modify the transcription of genes involved in dopamine metabolism and signaling. Genetic differences in genes that play an important role within the dopaminergic synapse, i.e. COMT (important for dopamine degradation) and dopamine receptor D2 (A1 allele of Taq1A), lead to altered dopamine signaling and can therefore contribute to higher vulnerability for diet-induced obesity (Annerbrink et al., 2008; Epstein et al., 2007). One important environmental factor that is hypothesized to affect dopamine transmission in obesity is an unhealthy diet. Accumulating evidence from animal research suggests that observed differences in dopamine signaling in obesity may be induced by diet rather than obesity (Geiger et al., 2009; Narayanaswami, Thompson, Cassis, Bardo, &amp; Dwoskin, 2013; van de Giessen et al., 2013; Vucetic, Carlin, Totoki, &amp; Reyes, 2012). However, the evidence for diet-induced alterations in dopamine signal transmission and their effects on dopamine-mediated cognitive processes in humans is scarce. In a first study, we now report initial indirect evidence for diet-related differences in central dopamine availability (Hartmann et al., 2019). We observed higher peripheral levels of dopamine precursors (i.e., the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine) relative to other large neutral amino acids in those volunteers who reported high intake of saturated fat and added sugar compared to those reporting low intake. The ratio of dopamine precursors to other large neutral amino acids has been shown to reflect central dopamine availability in the human striatum (Montgomery et al., 2003; Leyton et al., 2004). In the proposed study, we aim to address the relationship between a diet high in fat and sugar and proxies of systemic dopamine signal transmission in the brain and on dopamine-mediated cognitive performance. Further, we aim to replicate the diet-related group difference in peripheral dopamine precursor availability in an independent sample.\n\n2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS \n2.1 GENERAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS (see separate preregistrations for analysis plan)\n\u2022\tIs the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed habitually associated with dopamine-mediated cognition? \n\u2022\tDoes (epi)genetic variation explain variance in the association between diet and dopamine-mediated cognition? \n\n2.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE STUDY POPULATION (see below for analysis plan)\n\u2022\tIs the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed associated with peripheral availability of dopamine precursors? Based on previous findings in our lab (Hartmann et al., 2019) we predict that on the group level participants who follow a diet high in saturated fat and added sugar have a higher peripheral availability of peripheral dopamine precursors (pDAP)\n\u2022\tIs genetic predisposition in genes related to dopamine transmission associated with the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed (high vs low)?\n\u2022\tAre our putative proxies of dopamine (eye blink rate, working memory capacity, dopaminergic genes mRNA expression) associated with diet-related group differences in peripheral availability of dopamine precursors?\n\n3. METHODS\n\n3.1 PARTICIPANTS\nData acquisition will end on 31st of January 2020 due to resource limitations. We will not be able to reach the desired sample size of 140 participants, 70 participants per dietary group, but intend to end up with groups of similar size (currently 43 vs 43). All volunteers complete the Dietary Fat and free Sugar \u2013 Short Questionnaire (DFS) assessing self-reported dietary style regarding fat and sugar intake. Cut-off values for the diet groups were defined based on data reported in Fromm &amp; Horstmann, 2019:\n\u2022\tHigh Fat and Sugar (HFS) group: DFS score \u2265 62 (highest quartile)\n\u2022\tLow Fat and Sugar (LFS) group: DFS score \u2264 52 (lowest quartile). The original cutoff was 48, but had to be adjusted to 52 one year into testing due to substantial problems in recruiting LFS participants\n\nInclusion criteria: \n\u2022\tMale, healthy participants between the age of 18 and 40 years \n\u2022\tright-handed \n\u2022\tfluent German speakers\n\u2022\tDFS-Q score \u2265 62 (HFS) or \u2264 52 (LFS) \n\nExclusion criteria \n\u2022\tBMI below 18.5 or above 45 kg/m\u00b2\n\u2022\tpersonal or first-degree-relative history of psychiatric or neurological disease\n\u2022\thistory of significant head injury (i.e. loss of consciousness)\n\u2022\tcontraindications for MRI \n\u2022\tmetabolic diseases, i.e. diabetes mellitus type I/II or thyroid dysfunction\n\u2022\tregular intake of psychotropic medications, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol use (on average no more than 20g alcohol/day \u2259 1-2 beer 0,5 l/day), smoking (no regular smoking within the last year, no cigarettes within the last 3 months)\n\u2022\texcessive self-reported physical exercise, because of its effect on striatal dopamine (Petzinger et al., 2015)\n\u2022\tBDI score above 19 (Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Steer, &amp;

van der Linden, 2008) to assess four specific aspects of impulsive behavior: urgency (tendency to act rashly under negative emotions), lack of premeditation (tendency to act without overthinking the consequences), lack of perseverance (inability to stay focused on a task), sensation seeking (tendency to seek for novel and exciting experiences)\n\n3.4.3 Characterizing groups in terms of physical activity\n\u2022\tInternational Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; Hagstr\u00f6mer, Oja, &amp; Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, 2006) to assess individual differences in physical activity by categorizing individuals in terms of low, moderate, and high physical activity\n\n3.5 SEVEN-DAY PEDOMETER MEASUREMENT\nAlterations in dopaminergic transmission seem to exert an influence on physical activity (Friend et al., 2017; Kravitz et al., 2016). Participants in this study will wear a pedometer to measure step count as estimate for physical activity for seven consecutive days after completion of the last test day. Physical activity is an additional outcome measure and will be compared between groups. \n\n3.6 NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS\n\u2022\t\u201cReitan trail making tests part A and B\u201d (Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery, REITAN, 1955) for assessing visual-motor ability, processing speed, and mental flexibility\n\u2022\t\u201cDigit Symbol Substitution Test\u201d (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler 1955) for assessing attention and associative abilities\n\u2022\t\u201cDigit span test\u201d (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler 1955) for assessing working memory capacity\n\u2022\t\u201cWiener-Matrizen-Test 2\u201d (Formann, Waldherr &amp; Piswanger, 1979) to control for general intelligence. \n\n3.7 EYE-BLINK-RATE \nEye blink rate will be measured for a duration of 5 minutes as a putative proxy for dopamine tone in the central nervous system (Jongkees &amp; Colzato, 2016) (but see also Dang et al., 2017; Sescousse et al., 2018).\n\n4. ANALYSES PLAN RELATED TO THE STUDY POPULATION\n4.1 CENTRAL DOPAMINE PRECURSOR AVAILABILITY\nThe ratio of peripheral dopamine precursors Phenylalanine and Tyrosine to other large neutral amino acids \u2013 Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (Ile), Lysine (Lys), Methionine (Met), Valine (Val), Threonine (Thr), Tryptophan (Trp) \u2013 has been shown to reflect central dopamine synthesis (Fernstrom, 2013). Similar to Hartmann et al., 2019 we calculate central dopamine precursor availability (pDAP) as \npDAP = Phe + Tyr/(Leu + Ile + Lys + Met + Val + Thr + Trp)\nfor each group. We will compare pDAP between the two groups using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s t-test).\n\n4.2 DISTRIBUTION OF GENOTYPES OVER DIET GROUPS\nTo test whether genotypic variation in genes related to dopamine transmission predicts consumption of saturated fat and added sugar we use Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test with diet groups (LFS vs HFS) and  SNP variants for each gene separately as categories. SNP variants of each gene will be grouped as follows:\n\u2022\tTaq1A: Taq1 risk allele carriers vs non-carriers\n\u2022\tCOMT: Val/Val vs Val/Met vs Met/Met\n\u2022\tC957T: C/C vs C/T vs T/T\n\u2022\tDARPP-32: G/G vs G/A vs A/A. In case the number of participants in the G/G is low (&lt; 5), we combine G/G and G/A carriers (see Frank et al., 2007)\n\u2022\tFTO (rs8053740):\n\u2022\tFTO (rs8050136): A/A vs A/C vs C/C. In case the number of participants in the A/A is low (&lt; 5), we combine A/A and A/C carriers (see Sevgi et al., 2015)\n \n4.3 GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PUTATIVE PROXIES OF CENTRAL DOPAMINE\n\u2022\tMean eye blink rate per minute\n\u2022\tMaximum backward digit span\n\u2022\tmRNA expression levels of dopaminergic genes\nGroup differences in the three abovementioned measures will be tested using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s t-test). The relationship of these dopamine proxies with pDAP will be tested using Pearson correlation coefficient, or Spearman rank correlation coefficient in case the data is not normally distributed and heteroscedasticity is detected. Linear models with pDAP as independent and each of the three putative dopamine proxies as dependent variable will test the association of those measurements\n\n4.4 GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\nGroup differences in physical activity will be tested using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s test). Physical activity will be defined as daily average step count (total steps/number measurement days).\n\n5.

SUMMARY\nThe neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role in several cognitive domains such as motivation, reward-processing, reinforcement learning, decision-making and executive functions including working memory and attention (Arnsten, Wang, &amp; Paspalas, 2012; Logue &amp; Gould, 2013; Rogers, 2011; Schultz, 2002; Volkow, Wise, &amp; Baler, 2017). Results of our recent studies point towards prominent alterations in these domains in overweight and obesity and suggest the existence of a non-linear relationship between markers of obesity and central dopamine tone (Horstmann, Fenske, &amp; Hankir, 2015). Dopamine tone in the brain depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Via epigenetic mechanisms, environmental factors may directly modify the transcription of genes involved in dopamine metabolism and signaling. Genetic differences in genes that play an important role within the dopaminergic synapse, i.e. COMT (important for dopamine degradation) and dopamine receptor D2 (A1 allele of Taq1A), lead to altered dopamine signaling and can therefore contribute to higher vulnerability for diet-induced obesity (Annerbrink et al., 2008; Epstein et al., 2007). One important environmental factor that is hypothesized to affect dopamine transmission in obesity is an unhealthy diet. Accumulating evidence from animal research suggests that observed differences in dopamine signaling in obesity may be induced by diet rather than obesity (Geiger et al., 2009; Narayanaswami, Thompson, Cassis, Bardo, &amp; Dwoskin, 2013; van de Giessen et al., 2013; Vucetic, Carlin, Totoki, &amp; Reyes, 2012). However, the evidence for diet-induced alterations in dopamine signal transmission and their effects on dopamine-mediated cognitive processes in humans is scarce. In a first study, we now report initial indirect evidence for diet-related differences in central dopamine availability (Hartmann et al., 2019). We observed higher peripheral levels of dopamine precursors (i.e., the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine) relative to other large neutral amino acids in those volunteers who reported high intake of saturated fat and added sugar compared to those reporting low intake. The ratio of dopamine precursors to other large neutral amino acids has been shown to reflect central dopamine availability in the human striatum (Montgomery et al., 2003; Leyton et al., 2004). In the proposed study, we aim to address the relationship between a diet high in fat and sugar and proxies of systemic dopamine signal transmission in the brain and on dopamine-mediated cognitive performance. Further, we aim to replicate the diet-related group difference in peripheral dopamine precursor availability in an independent sample.\n\n2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS \n2.1 GENERAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS (see separate preregistrations for analysis plan)\n\u2022\tIs the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed habitually associated with dopamine-mediated cognition? \n\u2022\tDoes (epi)genetic variation explain variance in the association between diet and dopamine-mediated cognition? \n\n2.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE STUDY POPULATION (see below for analysis plan)\n\u2022\tIs the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed associated with peripheral availability of dopamine precursors? Based on previous findings in our lab (Hartmann et al., 2019) we predict that on the group level participants who follow a diet high in saturated fat and added sugar have a higher peripheral availability of peripheral dopamine precursors (pDAP)\n\u2022\tIs genetic predisposition in genes related to dopamine transmission associated with the amount of saturated fat and added sugar consumed (high vs low)?\n\u2022\tAre our putative proxies of dopamine (eye blink rate, working memory capacity, dopaminergic genes mRNA expression) associated with diet-related group differences in peripheral availability of dopamine precursors?\n\n3. METHODS\n\n3.1 PARTICIPANTS\nData acquisition will end on 31st of January 2020 due to resource limitations. We will not be able to reach the desired sample size of 140 participants, 70 participants per dietary group, but intend to end up with groups of similar size (currently 43 vs 43). All volunteers complete the Dietary Fat and free Sugar \u2013 Short Questionnaire (DFS) assessing self-reported dietary style regarding fat and sugar intake. Cut-off values for the diet groups were defined based on data reported in Fromm &amp; Horstmann, 2019:\n\u2022\tHigh Fat and Sugar (HFS) group: DFS score \u2265 62 (highest quartile)\n\u2022\tLow Fat and Sugar (LFS) group: DFS score \u2264 52 (lowest quartile). The original cutoff was 48, but had to be adjusted to 52 one year into testing due to substantial problems in recruiting LFS participants\n\nInclusion criteria: \n\u2022\tMale, healthy participants between the age of 18 and 40 years \n\u2022\tright-handed \n\u2022\tfluent German speakers\n\u2022\tDFS-Q score \u2265 62 (HFS) or \u2264 52 (LFS) \n\nExclusion criteria \n\u2022\tBMI below 18.5 or above 45 kg/m\u00b2\n\u2022\tpersonal or first-degree-relative history of psychiatric or neurological disease\n\u2022\thistory of significant head injury (i.e. loss of consciousness)\n\u2022\tcontraindications for MRI \n\u2022\tmetabolic diseases, i.e. diabetes mellitus type I/II or thyroid dysfunction\n\u2022\tregular intake of psychotropic medications, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol use (on average no more than 20g alcohol/day \u2259 1-2 beer 0,5 l/day), smoking (no regular smoking within the last year, no cigarettes within the last 3 months)\n\u2022\texcessive self-reported physical exercise, because of its effect on striatal dopamine (Petzinger et al., 2015)\n\u2022\tBDI score above 19 (Beck Depression Inventory, Beck, Steer, &amp;

Physical activity is an additional outcome measure and will be compared between groups. \n\n3.6 NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS\n\u2022\t\u201cReitan trail making tests part A and B\u201d (Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery, REITAN, 1955) for assessing visual-motor ability, processing speed, and mental flexibility\n\u2022\t\u201cDigit Symbol Substitution Test\u201d (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler 1955) for assessing attention and associative abilities\n\u2022\t\u201cDigit span test\u201d (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler 1955) for assessing working memory capacity\n\u2022\t\u201cWiener-Matrizen-Test 2\u201d (Formann, Waldherr &amp; Piswanger, 1979) to control for general intelligence. \n\n3.7 EYE-BLINK-RATE \nEye blink rate will be measured for a duration of 5 minutes as a putative proxy for dopamine tone in the central nervous system (Jongkees &amp; Colzato, 2016) (but see also Dang et al., 2017; Sescousse et al., 2018).\n\n4. ANALYSES PLAN RELATED TO THE STUDY POPULATION\n4.1 CENTRAL DOPAMINE PRECURSOR AVAILABILITY\nThe ratio of peripheral dopamine precursors Phenylalanine and Tyrosine to other large neutral amino acids \u2013 Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (Ile), Lysine (Lys), Methionine (Met), Valine (Val), Threonine (Thr), Tryptophan (Trp) \u2013 has been shown to reflect central dopamine synthesis (Fernstrom, 2013). Similar to Hartmann et al., 2019 we calculate central dopamine precursor availability (pDAP) as \npDAP = Phe + Tyr/(Leu + Ile + Lys + Met + Val + Thr + Trp)\nfor each group. We will compare pDAP between the two groups using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s t-test).\n\n4.2 DISTRIBUTION OF GENOTYPES OVER DIET GROUPS\nTo test whether genotypic variation in genes related to dopamine transmission predicts consumption of saturated fat and added sugar we use Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test with diet groups (LFS vs HFS) and  SNP variants for each gene separately as categories. SNP variants of each gene will be grouped as follows:\n\u2022\tTaq1A: Taq1 risk allele carriers vs non-carriers\n\u2022\tCOMT: Val/Val vs Val/Met vs Met/Met\n\u2022\tC957T: C/C vs C/T vs T/T\n\u2022\tDARPP-32: G/G vs G/A vs A/A. In case the number of participants in the G/G is low (&lt; 5), we combine G/G and G/A carriers (see Frank et al., 2007)\n\u2022\tFTO (rs8053740):\n\u2022\tFTO (rs8050136): A/A vs A/C vs C/C. In case the number of participants in the A/A is low (&lt; 5), we combine A/A and A/C carriers (see Sevgi et al., 2015)\n \n4.3 GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PUTATIVE PROXIES OF CENTRAL DOPAMINE\n\u2022\tMean eye blink rate per minute\n\u2022\tMaximum backward digit span\n\u2022\tmRNA expression levels of dopaminergic genes\nGroup differences in the three abovementioned measures will be tested using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s t-test). The relationship of these dopamine proxies with pDAP will be tested using Pearson correlation coefficient, or Spearman rank correlation coefficient in case the data is not normally distributed and heteroscedasticity is detected. Linear models with pDAP as independent and each of the three putative dopamine proxies as dependent variable will test the association of those measurements\n\n4.4 GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\nGroup differences in physical activity will be tested using the independent samples unequal variances t-test (Welch\u2019s test). Physical activity will be defined as daily average step count (total steps/number measurement days).\n\n5.

Should the test return an indicative but not a significant result (p&lt;0.05), the Mann-Whitney U tests will proceed with their results considered as suggestive evidence.\n", "q19.uploader": []},

Recognition accuracy will be higher in the highlighting vs. silent condition (i.e., a highlighting\neffect).\n3. No prediction is made for whether recognition accuracy will be higher in the aloud vs.\nhighlighting condition.\n4. No prediction is made for whether the effect of aloud vs. highlighting vs. silent\nconditions will be different for immediate vs. delayed conditions.\n5. Mean JOL will be higher for aloud vs. silent condition.\n6. Mean JOL will be higher for highlighting vs. silent condition.\n7. No prediction is made for whether JOL will be higher in the aloud vs. highlighting condition.\n8. Mean effect expectation will be higher in the second block.\n9. Mean prediction of performance will be higher for the multiple-choice questions\ncorresponded to the articles studied using aloud and highlighting methods vs. silent.\n10. No prediction is made for the difference in prediction of performance accuracy for the\nmultiple-choice questions for highlighted vs. aloud vs. silent studied articles.", "study_type": "Experiment"}, "subjects": []}, "relationships": {"children": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/children/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "comments": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/comments/?format=json&filter%5Btarget%5D=vxp9b", "meta": {}}}}, "contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "bibliographic_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/bibliographic_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "implicit_contributors": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/implicit_contributors/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "files": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/files/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "wikis": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/wikis/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "forks": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/forks/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "node_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/node_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/linked_by_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_by_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/linked_by_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "identifiers": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/identifiers/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "affiliated_institutions": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/relationships/institutions/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "region": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/regions/au-1/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "au-1", "type": "regions"}}, "root": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vxp9b", "type": "registrations"}}, "logs": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/logs/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_nodes": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/relationships/linked_nodes/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "linked_registrations": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}, "self": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/relationships/linked_registrations/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "view_only_links": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/view_only_links/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}, "citation": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/citation/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "vxp9b", "type": "registrations"}}, "registered_by": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/rjhbn/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "rjhbn", "type": "users"}}, "registered_from": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t3hq7/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "t3hq7", "type": "nodes"}}, "registration_schema": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/schemas/registrations/5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2/?format=json", "meta": {}}}, "data": {"id": "5d2d2268d28338002c2432d2", "type": "registration-schemas"}}, "provider": {"links": {"related": {"href": "https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/registrations/osf/?format=json", "meta": {}}}}}, "links": {"html": "https://osf.io/vxp9b/", "self": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/vxp9b/"}}], "links": {"first": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json", "last": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=547", "prev": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=137", "next": "https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter%5Bdate_created%5D%5Bgt%5D=2019-12-31&format=json&page=139", "meta": {"total": 5469, "per_page": 10}}}
