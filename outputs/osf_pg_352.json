Research Question 1: Ethnic identities are often activated during times of political competition. During election campaigns, politicians engage in rhetoric emphasizing the real or alleged crimes of ethnic outgroups, such as their involvement in violence, and seek to highlight the extent to which their own group is under attack. Because violence is thought to \"harden\" the boundaries between ethnic groups, engaging in such rhetoric is an ideal political tool for ethnic entrepreneurs and political elites who are able to present themselves as the necessary protectors of the ethnic in-group. In these contexts, what kind of messaging can help to reduce intergroup prejudice? In particular, can framing ethnic violence as being primarily perpetrated by politicians and criminals for purposes of personal gain dampen prejudicial attitudes towards ordinary members of outgroups? Can such a frame counter the negative effects of electoral campaigning on the basis of ethnic groups being under attack by rival groups?

If the United States were not perceived as a democracy, or as a diminished or partial democracy, would this affect its ability to maintain its global alliance network? Would it affect its ability to pursue other important foreign policy goals? In the context of the unusual presidency of Donald Trump, and the now well-documented attempts by Russia to interfere in the 2016 United States election that brought him to power, scholars have focused on Americans\u2019 reactions to foreign election meddling (Tomz & Weeks 2018) and on the impact of Trump on America\u2019s image abroad (Agadjanian & Horiuchi 2018). However, another potentially important aspect of these seemingly new phenomena in international politics is the impact on the U.S. image as a democracy in foreign countries, perhaps most significantly in formal U.S. military allies. U.S. image as a democracy, for example captured in the phrase \u201cleader of the free world,\u201d has been central to its international role since the end of the Second World War. Most of the United States\u2019 key military alliances involve other democracies, including almost all NATO states, Japan, Australia, and South Korea. It is a reasonable assumption that perception of the U.S. as a democracy is both an important justification for the existence and purpose of those alliances, and crucial for their maintenance and survival. But what would happen if citizens of allied countries came to see U.S. democracy as severely flawed, or even came to regard it as non-democratic? In recent (non-public) testimony to the U.S. Congress, former F.B.I. lawyer Lisa Page made the following statement regarding the purpose of Russian election interference (Goldman, Schmidt & Fandos 2019): \u201cIn the Russian Federation and in President Putin himself, you have an individual whose aim is to disrupt the Western alliance and whose aim is to make Western democracy more fractious in order to weaken our ability, America\u2019s ability and the West\u2019s ability to spread our democratic ideals.... That\u2019s the goal, to make us less of a moral authority....\u201d In addition to the ability to \u201cspread democratic ideals,\u201d another crucial role for U.S. \u201cmoral authority\u201d as a democracy, I contend, might be the maintenance of its military alliance system. This aspect of foreign election meddling has not, to the best of our knowledge, been investigated in the social science literature. I run a study assessing the impact of information about the attempt (and success) of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election on the views of Australians and Britons about the United States as a military ally. The online survey experiment has a total of 3,000 respondents (in the UK or Australia) randomly assigned to one of three groups. After some initial questions, one group will be asked to read a text (Treatment 1) about Russian interference in U.S. elections that claims the election results were affected and U.S. democracy was \u201creduced.\u201d Another group will be asked to read a text (Treatment 2) about Russian interference in U.S. elections that claims the election results were not affected and U.S. democracy was \u201cnot reduced.\u201d A third group will read no text and just move on to the next section of the survey (Control). To understand the impact of (successful) election interference in U.S. democracy and the potential perception of U.S. weakness due to the fact of election interference (regardless of its success), I take the following strategies. First, I word the treatments in such a way that the characterization of the potency of the election interference is similar in each treatment, while the reasons for failure in Treatment 2 are portrayed as outside of U.S. control (\u201cmost forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all\u201d). Second, I examine three pairs of hypotheses, discussed in the following sections, relating to different aspects of respondents\u2019 attitudes towards the alliance. I theorize that \u201ctrust\u201d (H1a & H1b) and \u201cshared values\u201d (H2a & H2b) are closely related to the identity of the U.S. as a democracy, but not to its capabilities, while more general or realpolitik aspects of attitudes towards alliances (H3a & H3b) are related to both democracy and capability. Thus, if Treatment 2 conveys a perception of weaker U.S. capabilities, this treatment effect should emerge more strongly in H3b than in H1b or H2b, which I explain below."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a: Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will be associated with lower trust in the U.S. as an ally. H1b: Receiving information about Russian election meddling will not be associated with lower trust in the U.S. as an ally. H2a: Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will be associated with lower belief in shared values with the U.S. as an ally. H2b: Receiving information about Russian election meddling will not be associated with lower belief in shared values with the U.S. as an ally. H3a: Receiving information about the reduction of US democracy will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S. H3b: Receiving information about Russian election meddling will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S. H4: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have high favorability for President Donald Trump. H5: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have low trust in the mass media."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypotheses 1a and 1b: Trust in the US as an ally More specifically, I theorize that providing respondents with information about Russian election meddling in the US and its effectiveness can reduce trust in the U.S. to fulfil its alliance obligations. Because the motivation for the alliance relationship is based on common interests shared by democracies, the logic goes, once this fundamental aspect of U.S. identity is reduced, citizens of allied democracies will also reduce their expectations that the U.S. will have an interest in defending other democracies. This expectation is reflected in our first hypothesis (H1a): Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will be associated with lower trust in the U.S. as an ally. This main hypothesis will be tested with a Treatment 1, which presents a text of information compiled from U.S. news media that asserts that Russian election interference occurred, that it was successful in manipulating the election result, and that the U.S. has not responded effectively to prevent this from happening again. The treatment includes the title \u201cElection Interference Has Reduced American Democracy\u201d and also the statement \u201cExperts now say the U.S. can no longer be considered a \u2018fully functioning democracy.\u2019\u201d The outcome variable to test the main hypothesis is the item \u201cIf the UK\u2019s (Australia\u2019s) security were threatened by some other country, how much trust do you feel the UK (Australia) could have in the United States to come to the UK\u2019s (Australia\u2019s) defence?\u201d Trust is perhaps the central dynamic of a military alliance, since each party must trust the other to honor the agreement. However, I also recognize that providing information about Russian election interference in the U.S. might convey an impression of U.S. weakness in terms of basic capabilities and the resolve to address foreign threats. If the U.S. cannot protect one of its core domestic institutions from interference by a known and less-powerful adversary, its desirability as an ally on purely pragmatic terms might be questioned. But this effect should not relate to trust. Rather, it relates to effectiveness. I therefore include a second group that is provided with Treatment 2, which again presents a text of information compiled from U.S. news media that asserts that Russian election interference occurred, but that it was not successful in manipulating the election result. The treatment includes the title \u201cElection Interference Has Not Reduced American Democracy\u201d and also the statement \u201cExperts say the U.S. can still longer be considered a \u2018fully functioning democracy.\u2019\u201d This treatment thus conveys that while the election interference might not have succeeded, it nevertheless was serious and did occur, which paints a similar picture of U.S. weakness while maintaining its democratic character. I expect that the U.S. will still be trusted as a democratic ally, even if its effectiveness may be doubted, by respondents receiving Treatment 2. This expectation is reflected in our second hypothesis (H1b): Receiving information about Russian election meddling will not be associated with lower trust in the US as an ally. I again use the outcome variable focused on trust in the U.S. to test this hypothesis. Hypotheses 2a and 2b: Belief in shared values with the US as an ally Another way in which beliefs about U.S. democracy may be related to attitudes towards the U.S. alliance is shared values. Citizens may believe that common values among societies strengthen the reliability and desirability of a military alliance. In the case of the U.S. and its democratic allies, U.S. identity as a democracy should be one major source of such common values. A sense of shared values may be important for attitudes towards the alliance because these will be reflected in common interests, but it may also be important because shared values imply a moral motivation to defend an ally. The hypothesis to be tested regarding values is H2a: Receiving information about the reduction of U.S. democracy will be associated with lower belief in shared values with the US as an ally. The treatment for this is also Treatment 1, and the survey item used to measure the outcome is: \u201cHere are some different arguments about the United Kingdom\u2019s (Australia\u2019s) alliance relationship with the United States. For each one, please indicate how much you personally agree or disagree. The British (Australians) and Americans share many common values and ideals. A strong alliance is a natural extension of this.\u201d I expect that respondents who receive information about reduced American democracy will believe there are lower shared values with the UK (Australia), and will therefore be less likely to agree with the statement. Again, I want to compare the treatment effect of reduced democracy due to election meddling with that of election meddling that did not reduce democracy. I use Treatment 2 to assess this, based on our fourth hypothesis (H2b): Receiving information about Russian election meddling will not be associated with lower belief in shared values with the U.S. as an ally. Hypotheses 3a and 3b: Support for alliance with the US While I have specific expectations for attitudes towards the U.S. alliance involving trust and shared values based on a distinction between perceived democracy and perceived weakness, more general attitudes of support for the alliance might not be subject to such nuances. Both U.S. democracy and U.S. strength might contribute to general support for the alliance among citizens in allied countries, since both of these are desirable qualities for an ally of a democracy. I therefore expect that both Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 will have negative effects on attitudes towards the alliance in general. These expectations are reflected in hypotheses H3a: Receiving information about the reduction of US democracy will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S.; and H3b: Receiving information about Russian election meddling will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S. These will be tested on five additional questions (listed in the pre-analyis plan) about the alliance having to do with concepts of \u201cattack\u201d, \u201cinterests\u201d \u201cChina and Russia\u201d \u201cdecline\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d. If most of these items elicit the expected treatment effect, I will take this as support for a strong general negative effect on attitudes towards the alliance. I will use these questions separately as well as a composite measure build based on them. Hypotheses 4 and 5: Moderation effects I expect attitudes towards President Trump and towards the news media to condition the treatment responses. Specifically, I expect the following two moderation effects: H4: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have high favorability for President Donald Trump. H5: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have low trust in the mass media."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Australia, United Kingdom"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "2 x 3000 = 6000"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "Australian National University Human Research Ethics Committee Protocol 2019/539."}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "8/15/19"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "Qualtrics"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "F52, F53, D72, D74"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design", "Survey Methodology"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Conflict and Violence", "Elections"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738"}, "attributes": {"etag": "f5583a10dc39ca8c0476abacc8898cda5576b5be30ac95e09e961b04998a3a97", "kind": "file", "name": "20190901AC_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3870cb57427b017c0c5738", "size": 145768, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "3a3fb35129c6f5057e527492ee81df7a", "sha256": "61b3bf67ae9005d94dc8c54fb09e1b3a67fc8eb31fd287293551444ef4c7be8a"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 145768, "modified": "2020-02-03T19:13:15.827925+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "37wqg", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190901AC_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T19:13:15+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "37wqg", "sha256": "61b3bf67ae9005d94dc8c54fb09e1b3a67fc8eb31fd287293551444ef4c7be8a", "viewUrl": "/project/dy8te/files/osfstorage/5e3870d357427b01830c668f/", "selectedFileName": "20190901AC_PAP.pdf"}, {"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/37wqg/providers/osfstorage/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e"}, "attributes": {"etag": "9e4dd31754eb0ca38e2b1c2365ddc4337c48473e77db3d680f2c6249053da858", "kind": "file", "name": "20190901AC_addendum_20191211.pdf", "path": "/5e3870cefa39b701761ddc1e", "size": 114652, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "d55dac44ba1e13c258d548d014cfaa4c", "sha256": "7c16b0d41dbd9e7bb3e1b9a0054ce71c2328f82046e3f7cb1b6cf84d106ca045"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 114652, "modified": "2020-02-03T19:13:18.949993+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "37wqg", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20190901AC_addendum_20191211.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T19:13:18+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "37wqg", "sha256": "7c16b0d41dbd9e7bb3e1b9a0054ce71c2328f82046e3f7cb1b6cf84d106ca045", "viewUrl": "/project/dy8te/files/osfstorage/5e3870d357427b01830c668d/", "selectedFileName": "20190901AC_addendum_20191211.pdf"}], "value": "20190901AC_PAP.pdf, 20190901AC_addendum_20191211.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "The Impact of Russian Election Meddling on Allies\u2019 Trust in the United States", "q2": "Benjamin E.

Both U.S. democracy and U.S. strength might contribute to general support for the alliance among citizens in allied countries, since both of these are desirable qualities for an ally of a democracy. I therefore expect that both Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 will have negative effects on attitudes towards the alliance in general. These expectations are reflected in hypotheses H3a: Receiving information about the reduction of US democracy will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S.; and H3b: Receiving information about Russian election meddling will be associated with lower support for alliance with the U.S. These will be tested on five additional questions (listed in the pre-analyis plan) about the alliance having to do with concepts of \u201cattack\u201d, \u201cinterests\u201d \u201cChina and Russia\u201d \u201cdecline\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d. If most of these items elicit the expected treatment effect, I will take this as support for a strong general negative effect on attitudes towards the alliance. I will use these questions separately as well as a composite measure build based on them. Hypotheses 4 and 5: Moderation effects I expect attitudes towards President Trump and towards the news media to condition the treatment responses. Specifically, I expect the following two moderation effects: H4: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have high favorability for President Donald Trump. H5: Treatment effects expected across our first three sets of hypotheses (H1a, H2a, H3a&b) will be attenuated for respondents who have low trust in the mass media.", "q18": "Australia, United

The same study also stated Vietnamese students tend to pursue unhealthy food habits, consuming sugary drinks and sweet food products. How to steer children\u2019s choice towards healthier options is an important question for schools and families.

Cognitive dissonance relates to the internal discomfort people feel when their beliefs, emotions, attitudes and actions enter into contradiction with one another. People are then motivated to reduce this tension by adjusting their beliefs or actions.
