Public support for courts is supposedly a source of power for judges, helping to create pressure on state officials for the proper implementation of judicial orders. Although people generally have little information about what courts do and how the state responds to judges, then can be informed about these processes. Common models of judicial-government interactions assume that citizens generally prefer that state officials comply but that reactions to evidence of non-compliance should be less negative when judicial orders lack clarity, when the financial costs of compliance to the state are high, and more negative when the victims of state non-compliance come from vulnerable populations. Our goal is to consider empirically how people react to news of non-compliance. The study draws on previous research tracking compliance with direct orders from judges to state officials in the context of the Colombian tutela in 2014, a legal instrument designed to provide swift redress for the violation of constitutional rights. A nationally representative sample of Colombians will be informed of the results of the previous study, which uncovered a significant degree of non-compliance with judicial orders. The primary piece of information for the study we report is that the overall non-compliance rate 30%. This rate suggests that roughly 127 out of 100,000 Colombians experienced non-compliance in the tutela in 2014.

First we propose that individuals will be less accepting of non-compliance and more willing to contribute when they learn about the overall compliance rate from our study (30%). Second, among those who know about the study's key finding, we propose that individuals are more likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders, and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. We also propose that they are less likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance have low SES. Third, among those who know about the study, we propose that individuals are less likely to contribute to an effort to improve compliance rates when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. They are more likely to contribute when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance come from vulnerable populations. The study also considers individual support for potential policy remedies. We propose that individuals are more likely to support a training program for judges in the drafting of clear orders in tutela than a program designed to simply provide information to the public about compliance rates when they know that judges often draft vague orders. We also propose that individuals will be less likely to support an increase in criminal penalties for non-compliance than the provision of information when they know that judges are often vague and that compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. We consider several possible heterogenous effects. First, we consider whether the effect of learning about the overall compliance rate depends on individual expectations. Individuals should be less (more) accepting of non-compliance and more likely (less likely) to contribute to a program designed to improve compliance rates when the rate we report is above (below) their expectations. Second we propose that the negative effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the acceptance of non-compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who hold strong beliefs in the rule of law. Third, we consider whether the positive effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the willingness to contribute to a program aimed at improving compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who are particularly likely to engage in social sanctioning. Fourth, we consider whether answering pre-treatment questions about the rule of law and social sanctioning increases the negative effect of learning about the non-compliance rate from our study. Our pre-analyses plan develops these ideas further."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "The hypotheses are tested via a randomized survey experiment conducted on a sample of 3,200 members of an internet panel managed by marketing firm NetQuest. All respondents are adults and Colombian citizens. Our pre-analysis plan provides a full description of the design as well as the analysis we intend to conduct. The following is a summary. Respondents are randomly assigned to 1 of 8 groups. Each group consists of 400 individuals. All groups are provided a short summary of the tutela. They are also informed of the legal requirement of state officials to comply with judicial orders. Groups 1-7 answer several questions pre-treatment; Group 8 does not. Groups 1 and 2 do not learn about the study's results. Group 2 provides an expectation about compliance; Group 1 does not. All other groups (i.e., Groups 3-8) learn about the study's non-compliance rate. Groups 2, 4 and 8 learn nothing else about the study. Group 4 gives an expectation about compliance. Groups 5-7 further learn exactly one additional feature of the study\u2019s results. Group 5 learns that judicial orders are often vague. Group 6 learns that compliance often involves spending considerable state resources. Group 7 learns that the beneficiaries of compliance often have very low levels of education. To measure the acceptability of non-compliance we use a 7 point Likert scale. To measure willingness to contribute, we give respondents the ability to donate \u201cNetQuest points\u201d (which are ultimately exchangeable with U.S. dollars). Our measure is simply the number of points that a respondent donates to a program designed to inform the Colombian public about compliance in tutelar. Treating these measures as normally distributed random variables, we compare means across groups via linear regression, using indicator variables for each treatment condition and fitting models with and without pre-treatment covariates. To evaluate the effects of judicial order vagueness, the cost of compliance, low SES of beneficiaries, as well as the possible effect of answering the pre-treatment questions, we limit the analysis to groups that learned about the study\u2019s overall non-compliance rate. Thus, Groups 1 and 2 are excluded from the analysis. We also exclude Group 4. Members of Group 3 serve as the baseline for comparison. To learn about the effects of simply learning about the study itself, we fit the same models but let the members of Group 1 serve as the baseline. Members of Groups 2 and 4 continue to be excluded from analysis. To evaluate the effects of prior expectations, we use Groups 2 and 4. Members of Group 2 who report an expectation about compliance very close (see pre-analysis plan) to what we report serve as the baseline for comparison. We fit a multiplicative interactive model that allows us to estimate the effect of learning about the study\u2019s compliance rate, conditional on whether a respondent reported a prior belief above, below or very close to what we report. This is accomplished by interacting the Group 4 indicator with indicators for whether respondents had beliefs, above, below are close to the rate we report. To evaluate the possibility that rule of law beliefs and commitments to social sanctioning change the effect of learning about the study\u2019s results, we focus on Groups 1 and 3. We fit a multiplicative interactive model that allows us to consider whether the effect of learning about the study depends on either rule of law beliefs or commitments to social sanctioning. This is accomplished by interacting an indicator for being in Group 3 with a scale for rule of beliefs (in the model of acceptability) and social sanctioning (in the model of willingness to contribute). Finally, to evaluate the effects of learning about judicial order vagueness, the cost of compliance and the SES status of beneficiaries on potential policy remedies, we fit a multinomial logistic regression using indicator variables for each treatment condition. Our sample includes the members of Groups 3, 5, 6 and 7. The dependent variable is a three category policy variable. Respondents can choose to support a policy that (1) provides information to the Colombian public about compliance, (2) requires judges to take a training course on writing clear orders in tutela and (3) increases criminal penalties for non-compliance in tutela. Comparisons across groups are made with the information provision option serving as the baseline category."}, "q18": {"extra": [], "value": "Colombia"}, "q19": {"extra": [], "value": "3200"}, "q20": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q22": {"extra": [], "value": "Yes"}, "q24": {"extra": [], "value": "IRB00089440"}, "q25": {"extra": [], "value": "17-Feb-17"}, "q26": {"extra": [], "value": "Other (describe in text box below)"}, "q27": {"extra": [], "value": "NetQuest"}, "q28": {"extra": [], "value": "No"}, "q32": {"extra": [], "value": "K42, K40, K00"}, "q33": {"extra": [], "value": ["Experimental Design"]}, "q34": {"extra": [], "value": ["Governance"]}, "q35": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q36": {"extra": [], "value": "Agree"}, "q37": {"extra": [{"data": {"id": "osfstorage/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78", "type": "files", "links": {"move": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/ktzwx/providers/osfstorage/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78", "delete": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/ktzwx/providers/osfstorage/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78", "upload": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/ktzwx/providers/osfstorage/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78?kind=file", "download": "https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/ktzwx/providers/osfstorage/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78"}, "attributes": {"etag": "a7138578fe68c3789fea992bd2b45075a2b8aca47dbaa70c637bb76e35777705", "kind": "file", "name": "20170805AA_PAP.pdf", "path": "/5e3850bcfa39b7015c1dda78", "size": 352253, "extra": {"guid": null, "hashes": {"md5": "c5c882d0b61f4ebfd48d68cb0c59b578", "sha256": "acb4c35fc0641b672274c2bd9303031f133ebee33a1dcf458d355014d85bc1fc"}, "version": 1, "checkout": null, "downloads": 0, "latestVersionSeen": null}, "sizeInt": 352253, "modified": "2020-02-03T16:56:28.091403+00:00", "provider": "osfstorage", "resource": "ktzwx", "contentType": "application/octet-stream", "created_utc": null, "materialized": "/20170805AA_PAP.pdf", "modified_utc": "2020-02-03T16:56:28+00:00"}}, "nodeId": "ktzwx", "sha256": "acb4c35fc0641b672274c2bd9303031f133ebee33a1dcf458d355014d85bc1fc", "viewUrl": "/project/c9z3a/files/osfstorage/5e3850c057427b01770c2dad/", "selectedFileName": "20170805AA_PAP.pdf"}], "value": "20170805AA_PAP.pdf"}, "q38": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}, "registration_responses": {"q1": "Public Reactions to Non-Compliance in the Colombian Tutela", "q2": "Jeffrey K.

Public support for courts is supposedly a source of power for judges, helping to create pressure on state officials for the proper implementation of judicial orders. Although people generally have little information about what courts do and how the state responds to judges, then can be informed about these processes. Common models of judicial-government interactions assume that citizens generally prefer that state officials comply but that reactions to evidence of non-compliance should be less negative when judicial orders lack clarity, when the financial costs of compliance to the state are high, and more negative when the victims of state non-compliance come from vulnerable populations. Our goal is to consider empirically how people react to news of non-compliance. The study draws on previous research tracking compliance with direct orders from judges to state officials in the context of the Colombian tutela in 2014, a legal instrument designed to provide swift redress for the violation of constitutional rights. A nationally representative sample of Colombians will be informed of the results of the previous study, which uncovered a significant degree of non-compliance with judicial orders. The primary piece of information for the study we report is that the overall non-compliance rate 30%. This rate suggests that roughly 127 out of 100,000 Colombians experienced non-compliance in the tutela in 2014. To put this in context, the murder and automotive fatality rates in Colombia in the same year were 31 and 17 per 100,000, respectively.", "q16": "Our primary hypotheses concern individual beliefs in the acceptability of non-compliance by state officials in tutela and the willingness to contribute to an effort to improve compliance rates. First we propose that individuals will be less accepting of non-compliance and more willing to contribute when they learn about the overall compliance rate from our study (30%). Second, among those who know about the study's key finding, we propose that individuals are more likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders, and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. We also propose that they are less likely to find non-compliance acceptable when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance have low SES. Third, among those who know about the study, we propose that individuals are less likely to contribute to an effort to improve compliance rates when they know that (a) judges often issue vague orders and (b) compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. They are more likely to contribute when they know that the beneficiaries of state compliance come from vulnerable populations. The study also considers individual support for potential policy remedies. We propose that individuals are more likely to support a training program for judges in the drafting of clear orders in tutela than a program designed to simply provide information to the public about compliance rates when they know that judges often draft vague orders. We also propose that individuals will be less likely to support an increase in criminal penalties for non-compliance than the provision of information when they know that judges are often vague and that compliance often requires the spending of considerable state resources. We consider several possible heterogenous effects. First, we consider whether the effect of learning about the overall compliance rate depends on individual expectations. Individuals should be less (more) accepting of non-compliance and more likely (less likely) to contribute to a program designed to improve compliance rates when the rate we report is above (below) their expectations. Second we propose that the negative effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the acceptance of non-compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who hold strong beliefs in the rule of law. Third, we consider whether the positive effect of learning about the overall non-compliance rate on the willingness to contribute to a program aimed at improving compliance is particularly strong among those individuals who are particularly likely to engage in social sanctioning. Fourth, we consider whether answering pre-treatment questions about the rule of law and social sanctioning increases the negative effect of learning about the non-compliance rate from our study. Our pre-analyses plan develops these ideas further.", "q17": "The hypotheses are tested via a randomized survey experiment conducted on a sample of 3,200 members of an internet panel managed by marketing firm NetQuest. All respondents are adults and Colombian citizens. Our pre-analysis plan provides a full description of the design as well as the analysis we intend to conduct. The following is a summary. Respondents are randomly assigned to 1 of 8 groups. Each group consists of 400 individuals. All groups are provided a short summary of the tutela. They are also informed of the legal requirement of state officials to comply with judicial orders. Groups 1-7 answer several questions pre-treatment; Group 8 does not. Groups 1 and 2 do not learn about the study's results. Group 2 provides an expectation about compliance; Group 1 does not. All other groups (i.e., Groups 3-8) learn about the study's non-compliance rate. Groups 2, 4 and 8 learn nothing else about the study. Group 4 gives an expectation about compliance. Groups 5-7 further learn exactly one additional feature of the study\u2019s results. Group 5 learns that judicial orders are often vague. Group 6 learns that compliance often involves spending considerable state resources. Group 7 learns that the beneficiaries of compliance often have very low levels of education. To measure the acceptability of non-compliance we use a 7 point Likert scale. To measure willingness to contribute, we give respondents the ability to donate \u201cNetQuest points\u201d (which are ultimately exchangeable with U.S. dollars).

Our conjoint survey targets professional underwriters or analysts working in the political risk insurance industry to analyze their perceptions of investment risk. Our main focus is how the country of origin of the investor shapes risk perceptions of insurers. We specifically test if investments from powerful states (the United States) are perceived as less risky for expropriation risk, and that if bilateral foreign aid and bilateral investment treaties further reduce risk perceptions."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Existing research on the political risk facing multinational investors have largely focused on host country (receiving investment) institutions affecting the risk environment for multinational corporations. In this project, we theorize that home countries can have a significant impact on political risk in three ways. First, we argue that powerful states, namely the United States, have the ability to pressure host governments to uphold the contracts struck between multinationals and host government. We thus theorize that investments from the United States and, to a lesser extent China, will be perceived as less risk than other, less powerful countries (Canada, and UK). Hypothesis 1: Respondents will perceive that US investors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Second, we theorize that one mechanisms through which countries can leverage countries to uphold contracts with multinationals is through the use of suspension of foreign aid. Thus, countries that are more dependent on an investor\u2019s home country foreign aid are less likely to renege on contracts with these investors. This leads to our second hypothesis. Hypothesis 2: Respondents will perceive that investors from countries that are major aid donors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Our final two theoretical mechanisms explore how the existence of bilateral investment (BITs) treaties reduce risks for foreign investors. One strand of literature argues that BITs are largely a signal of a country\u2019s willingness to uphold the rule of law with investors. Thus, a country that signs BITs with any country, is less likely to violate the contracts with foreign investors, even if the foreign investor isn\u2019t from a country that has signed and ratified such a treaty itself. Hypothesis 3: Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with any country a less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. An alternative mechanism is that that BITs are a legal mechanism that protect investors from signatory countries. This leads to our final hypothesis. Hypothesis 4: Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with the country of origin of the investor are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Our conjoint survey also includes a number of other country and project level attributes. These are not driven by new theory and thus we simply project our expectations for these additional attributes. Additional Investor Attributes Size of investor parent country Expectation: We expect that large investors will be less risky than small investors Industry of investor. Thus, we expect risk in the following direction: LargeManufacture for export Additional Location Attributes Level of country risk Expectation: We expect that countries with lower risk ratings (4/7) are lower risks than countries with higher risk ratings (5/7). Thus, we expect risk perceptions in the following direction: Country Risk=5 > Country Risk=4"}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "Our sample includes elites that have worked in or are currently employed as underwriters or analysts in the political risk insurance industry. This industry includes government and multilateral agencies such as the US Overseas Investment Protection Corporation (OPIC), Export Development Canada, and the World Bank\u2019s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Specialized insurers also cover political risk insurance, including organizations such as Sovereign LLC. Other major insurers such as Lloyds of London, Swiss RE, Zurich, and AIG have groups providing political risk insurance coverage. To identify potential participants in our survey we took the following steps. a) We used the political risk industry association, the Berne Union, to identify the major companies involved in political risk insurance. This list was used to identify the large political risk insurers to target. We contacted listed underwriters and analysts at these companies. These companies include: AIG (US) Atradius (Netherlands) Chubb (UK) Coface (France) Export Development Canada (Canada) EFIC Australia Euler Hermes (Germany) EKF (Denmark) EKN (Sweden) Finnvera (Finland) GIEK Norway Hiscox (Bermueda) Liberty Specialty Insurance (UK) Lloyds of London (UK) and associated syndicates MIGA (World Bank) NEXI (Japan) OeKB (Austria) OPIC (US) PwC Germany (Germany) Sace (Italy) Serv (Switzerland) Sovereign (Bermuda) UK Export Finance (UK) Zurich (US) b) We harnessed existing political risk contacts to allow for additional recruitment of subjects. This included contacts at MIGA, OPIC and Berne Union to make email introductions to heads of underwriting groups or other individuals in management positions that could help with the recruitment of underwriters and analysts. c) We searched LinkedIn for individuals with job titles of \u201cpolitical risk insurance underwriters\u201d and individuals with equivalent job titles that were members of the following groups: Political Risk Assessment (4,890 members) Trade Credit and Political Risk Insurance Professionals (5,680 members) and Country Risk (3,025 members). In all cases, we limited our recruitment to individuals that are involved in the pricing (underwriters) or risk analysis for the political risk insurance industry. At the end of our conjoint we include a question verifying our participants experience in the industry. \u00a0 We have identified a total of 195 potential subjects for our study. Method-Conjoint Survey The experiment looks to discern whether and to what degree investor- and location-specific attributes of a given hypothetical investment are determining risk perception. Since any determination of risk would be contingent upon a set of attributes, we designed a conjoint experiment. The conjoint design allows us to isolate the effect of individual attributes by explicitly providing a range of relevant and potentially associated aspects of the investment. In doing so, we reduce the necessary amount of satisficing respondents typically engage in, because explicit reference of associated relevant information lowers the cognitive burden on the respondent. To further facilitate comprehension of the task at hand, respondents are presented with investor and location attributes in two adjacent sections. INVESTOR ATTRIBUTES Size of investor parent company -Large (Fortune 500), -Medium -Small Country of Origin -US -Canada -UK -China Industry of investor -Manufacturing for export -Manufacturing for domestic production -Oil and gas extraction LOCATION ATTRIBUTES Bilateral Investment Treaties -None -Treaties with countries other than (country of origin) -Treaties with countries including (country of origin) Level of Country Risk -OECD Country risk rating of 4 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk), -OECD Country risk rating of 5 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk) Major source of foreign aid -US -Canada -UK -China Methods-Analysis We harness a conjoint survey design (Hainmueller, Hopkins, Yamamoto 2014) to estimate the relative importance of different attributes for risk assessment through a paired conjoint with forced choice repeated 12 times.

Our conjoint survey targets professional underwriters or analysts working in the political risk insurance industry to analyze their perceptions of investment risk. Our main focus is how the country of origin of the investor shapes risk perceptions of insurers. We specifically test if investments from powerful states (the United States) are perceived as less risky for expropriation risk, and that if bilateral foreign aid and bilateral investment treaties further reduce risk perceptions.", "q16": "Existing research on the political risk facing multinational investors have largely focused on host country (receiving investment) institutions affecting the risk environment for multinational corporations. In this project, we theorize that home countries can have a significant impact on political risk in three ways. First, we argue that powerful states, namely the United States, have the ability to pressure host governments to uphold the contracts struck between multinationals and host government. We thus theorize that investments from the United States and, to a lesser extent China, will be perceived as less risk than other, less powerful countries (Canada, and UK). Hypothesis 1: Respondents will perceive that US investors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Second, we theorize that one mechanisms through which countries can leverage countries to uphold contracts with multinationals is through the use of suspension of foreign aid. Thus, countries that are more dependent on an investor\u2019s home country foreign aid are less likely to renege on contracts with these investors. This leads to our second hypothesis. Hypothesis 2: Respondents will perceive that investors from countries that are major aid donors are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Our final two theoretical mechanisms explore how the existence of bilateral investment (BITs) treaties reduce risks for foreign investors. One strand of literature argues that BITs are largely a signal of a country\u2019s willingness to uphold the rule of law with investors. Thus, a country that signs BITs with any country, is less likely to violate the contracts with foreign investors, even if the foreign investor isn\u2019t from a country that has signed and ratified such a treaty itself. Hypothesis 3: Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with any country a less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. An alternative mechanism is that that BITs are a legal mechanism that protect investors from signatory countries. This leads to our final hypothesis. Hypothesis 4: Respondents will perceive that foreign investments into countries that have BITs with the country of origin of the investor are less risky than equivalent investments from other countries. Our conjoint survey also includes a number of other country and project level attributes. These are not driven by new theory and thus we simply project our expectations for these additional attributes. Additional Investor Attributes Size of investor parent country Expectation: We expect that large investors will be less risky than small investors Industry of investor. Thus, we expect risk in the following direction: LargeManufacture for export Additional Location Attributes Level of country risk Expectation: We expect that countries with lower risk ratings (4/7) are lower risks than countries with higher risk ratings (5/7). Thus, we expect risk perceptions in the following direction: Country Risk=5 > Country Risk=4", "q17": "Our sample includes elites that have worked in or are currently employed as underwriters or analysts in the political risk insurance industry. This industry includes government and multilateral agencies such as the US Overseas Investment Protection Corporation (OPIC), Export Development Canada, and the World Bank\u2019s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Specialized insurers also cover political risk insurance, including organizations such as Sovereign LLC. Other major insurers such as Lloyds of London, Swiss RE, Zurich, and AIG have groups providing political risk insurance coverage. To identify potential participants in our survey we took the following steps. a) We used the political risk industry association, the Berne Union, to identify the major companies involved in political risk insurance. This list was used to identify the large political risk insurers to target. We contacted listed underwriters and analysts at these companies. These companies include: AIG (US) Atradius (Netherlands) Chubb (UK) Coface (France) Export Development Canada (Canada) EFIC Australia Euler Hermes (Germany) EKF (Denmark) EKN (Sweden) Finnvera (Finland) GIEK Norway Hiscox (Bermueda) Liberty Specialty Insurance (UK) Lloyds of London (UK) and associated syndicates MIGA (World Bank) NEXI (Japan) OeKB (Austria) OPIC (US) PwC Germany (Germany) Sace (Italy) Serv (Switzerland) Sovereign (Bermuda) UK Export Finance (UK) Zurich (US) b) We harnessed existing political risk contacts to allow for additional recruitment of subjects. This included contacts at MIGA, OPIC and Berne Union to make email introductions to heads of underwriting groups or other individuals in management positions that could help with the recruitment of underwriters and analysts. c) We searched LinkedIn for individuals with job titles of \u201cpolitical risk insurance underwriters\u201d and individuals with equivalent job titles that were members of the following groups: Political Risk Assessment (4,890 members) Trade Credit and Political Risk Insurance Professionals (5,680 members) and Country Risk (3,025 members). In all cases, we limited our recruitment to individuals that are involved in the pricing (underwriters) or risk analysis for the political risk insurance industry. At the end of our conjoint we include a question verifying our participants experience in the industry. \u00a0 We have identified a total of 195 potential subjects for our study. Method-Conjoint Survey The experiment looks to discern whether and to what degree investor- and location-specific attributes of a given hypothetical investment are determining risk perception. Since any determination of risk would be contingent upon a set of attributes, we designed a conjoint experiment. The conjoint design allows us to isolate the effect of individual attributes by explicitly providing a range of relevant and potentially associated aspects of the investment. In doing so, we reduce the necessary amount of satisficing respondents typically engage in, because explicit reference of associated relevant information lowers the cognitive burden on the respondent. To further facilitate comprehension of the task at hand, respondents are presented with investor and location attributes in two adjacent sections. INVESTOR ATTRIBUTES Size of investor parent company -Large (Fortune 500), -Medium -Small Country of Origin -US -Canada -UK -China Industry of investor -Manufacturing for export -Manufacturing for domestic production -Oil and gas extraction LOCATION ATTRIBUTES Bilateral Investment Treaties -None -Treaties with countries other than (country of origin) -Treaties with countries including (country of origin) Level of Country Risk -OECD Country risk rating of 4 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk), -OECD Country risk rating of 5 (1=lowest risk, 7 =highest risk) Major source of foreign aid -US -Canada -UK -China Methods-Analysis We harness a conjoint survey design (Hainmueller, Hopkins, Yamamoto 2014) to estimate the relative importance of different attributes for risk assessment through a paired conjoint with forced choice repeated 12 times. We make these design choices to minimize the amount of time required for our elites to conduct the survey. For each respondent we randomize the order of questions for the first comparisons and then fix this question order the remainder of experiment.

The GSAM is being implemented nationwide in Ghana, across 100 districts, from early 2015 through the end of 2018. The impact evaluation (IE) focuses on two GSAM interventions: (1) a series of top-down performance audits by the central government\u2019s Ghana Audit Service (GAS) of District Assembly (DA)-contracted and constructed development projects and (2) a bottom-up civil society organization (CSO)-led social audit campaign also focused on the quality of district development projects.

The GSAM is being implemented nationwide in Ghana, across 100 districts, from early 2015 through the end of 2018. The impact evaluation (IE) focuses on two GSAM interventions: (1) a series of top-down performance audits by the central government\u2019s Ghana Audit Service (GAS) of District Assembly (DA)-contracted and constructed development projects and (2) a bottom-up civil society organization (CSO)-led social audit campaign also focused on the quality of district development projects. Citizen outreach to diffuse the findings pertaining to each respective district\u2019s top-down or bottom-up programming has followed the top-down and bottom-up audits. Both the top-down and the bottom-up treatment arms focus on auditing districts\u2019 \u201cdevelopment projects.\u201d These projects include the schools, public toilets, clinics, feeder roads, irrigation projects, and other infrastructure and centers of public service provision that typically consume the lion\u2019s share of district government spending. The IE is designed as a randomized control trial to assess the two different activities of the governance program. The evaluation rigorously assesses the impact of performance audits and CSO-led social audits on improving accountability and service delivery outcomes by randomly assigning one of the two activity treatments or a pure control group status to 150 districts in Ghana; the districts were triplicate matched before assignment. Specifically, 50 districts received performance audits from the Ghana Audit Service and subsequent dissemination of the performance audit results through meetings with district officials and a public scorecard campaign. 50 similar, additional districts have received social audits from civil society organizations and subsequent dissemination of the social audit results through a different scorecard-based information dissemination campaign.", "q16": "There are three outcome \"families\", including those bearing on: 1) capital projects and service delivery; 2) the quality of district governance; and 3) district governance accountability and citizen engagement. The hypotheses have implications for citizens and the behaviour of administrators and politicians. We, thus, distinguish hypotheses by by population: Outcome 1: Capital projects and service delivery The interventions will increase citizen access to development projects and the corresponding services (H1), reduce obstacles to completing projects (H2), and increase citizen satisfaction with services (H3). Within district governments (i.e. among administrators and political officials), the interventions will improve district planning (H4), contracting (H5) and oversight of development projects (H6). Outcome 2: Governance quality The interventions will improve perceptions of the relative performance of district governments (H7), reduce the incidence of corruption (H8), and increase government transparency (H9). Outcome 3: District Government Accountability and Citizen Engagement The interventions will improve the responsiveness of DAs to community needs when it comes to budgeting (H10) and locating development projects (H11). The interventions will increase accountability for how district officials spend their time (H12) and allocate development projects (H13). The interventions will increase citizen knowledge about and participation in the budgeting process for development projects (H14).

Recent scholarly and public attention has focused on the role of electoral gender quotas in increasing the number of female representatives in national parliaments (Krook, 2006; Schwindt-Bayer, 2009; Tripp & Kang, 2008), but less work has examined factors that increase women\u2019s representation in local politics, particularly in non-quota contexts. Women\u2019s participation in local government varies greatly across the globe, reaching near parity in some sub-national governments (e.g., Namibia, Costa Rica), while remaining near or below single digits in others (e.g., Angola, Panama). Few studies address this variation. Further, while there has been significant research on female candidate emergence and electoral success in Europe and the U.S., we know much less about the barriers to women\u2019s participation in local governance in developing countries. We propose a study to test the barriers women candidates face in the political recruitment process, specifically related to candidate entry and electoral success. We investigate these questions in the context of Malawian local council elections. By law, Malawian local councils hold considerable local authority: they are responsible for enacting and enforcing national legislation, soliciting national funds for local infrastructure and economic development projects, and overseeing essential local services. In practice, the power of local councilors is yet to be seen, as they are serving for the first term in over a decade (Chasukwa, Chiweza, and Chikapa-Jamali, 2014). Despite a national campaign to increase the number of women elected to public office in Malawi (the 50-50 campaign), the 2009 and 2014 elections produced only modest increases in both national and local government. In the local council elections of May 2014, women made up 17 percent of the candidate pool and ultimately won 12 percent of local councilor positions (56 out of 457, country-wide). This represents a slight increase from the 2000 local elections, in which women won only 8.3 percent of councilor seats, but it is well below the 50 percent envisioned by the 50-50 campaign. To understand women\u2019s underrepresentation in local politics, we need to understand barriers women candidates face throughout the political recruitment process. In the context of Malawi\u2019s most recent local council elections, we focus on four research questions related to women\u2019s underrepresentation in local governance. The first two relate to candidate characteristics, namely: (1) What are the characteristics of women who seek elected office and how are these different than those of men candidates? (2) How do various other candidate features \u2013 such as political experience, family status, etc. \u2013 interact with candidate gender to affect the likelihood of electoral success? The second two questions relate to how voters evaluate women candidates: (3) How do voters evaluate women candidates relative to men candidates and why? (4) How does the framing of national campaigns meant to increase women\u2019s representation affect voters\u2019 support for women candidates? Data on the first two questions will help us better understand barriers to candidate entry that may limit the pool of competitive women candidates and campaign-related constraints unique to women. Data on the third and fourth questions will allow us to identify how gender biases affect voters\u2019 demand for women candidates."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1: Voters penalize women candidates when they believe they are inexperienced.

federally approved waivers of regular Medicaid policy. While such policies offer a potential path to expansion of Medicaid eligibility in states that have resisted expansion thus far, policy experts are generally very skeptical that they can be implemented well or that they will lead to positive outcomes (see Ku et al 2018). The political advantages of Medicaid work requirements, if any, could also be normatively troublesome. I argue that the political appeal of work requirements in social policy operates in part by affecting perceptions of what racial and ethnic groups will benefit from the policy. Specifically, they should reduce the likelihood that respondents identify the policy with stereotyped minorities (such as blacks and immigrants) while increasing the likelihood that they identify it with majority or in-groups (such as whites and people born in the US). In this project, I use a randomized experiment embedded on a national survey to determine if Medicaid work requirements do indeed shape public perceptions of who benefits from Medicaid expansion, and how those perceptions interact with attitudes about minority groups to shape their attitudes about the policy.

While such policies offer a potential path to expansion of Medicaid eligibility in states that have resisted expansion thus far, policy experts are generally very skeptical that they can be implemented well or that they will lead to positive outcomes (see Ku et al 2018). The political advantages of Medicaid work requirements, if any, could also be normatively troublesome. I argue that the political appeal of work requirements in social policy operates in part by affecting perceptions of what racial and ethnic groups will benefit from the policy. Specifically, they should reduce the likelihood that respondents identify the policy with stereotyped minorities (such as blacks and immigrants) while increasing the likelihood that they identify it with majority or in-groups (such as whites and people born in the US). In this project, I use a randomized experiment embedded on a national survey to determine if Medicaid work requirements do indeed shape public perceptions of who benefits from Medicaid expansion, and how those perceptions interact with attitudes about minority groups to shape their attitudes about the policy.
