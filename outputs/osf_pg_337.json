However, this research typically focuses on measuring abstract notions of support for democracy or ratings of democratic performance. As a result, few studies have considered voters\u2019 commitment to democracy in practice relative to other important considerations. Building on Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we use fully randomized conjoint analysis to explore the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democratic values in a series of hypothetical election scenarios. Our main interest is to determine whether and to what extent voters oppose candidates who do not uphold democratic values. We test a series of competing expectations regarding popular opposition to democratic norm violations versus popular support for voter ID laws, the involvement of legislators in law enforcement investigations, unwillingness to compromise with partisan opponents, and deference to judicial authority. We also investigate (1) which specific democratic values and policy positions are most strongly related to vote choice and how those effects compare; (2) whether voters are more likely to forgive transgressions against democratic values by co-partisan candidates than opposition party candidates (and how that relationship varies by approval of Donald Trump); and (3) whether the effects of candidates acting undemocratically vary by education, political knowledge, political interest, and/or age. Answers to these questions will help us better understand the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democracy and how it operates in the context of competitive partisan elections."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "H1a.

We conduct an online survey experiment with a sample of approximately 2000 respondents recruited from YouGov. Drawing theoretical inspiration from Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we present respondents with 10 pairs of hypothetical candidates in an election who randomly vary on eight attributes: name, partisanship, two policy platforms, and four \u201cdemocracy\u201d platforms. The policy platforms concern attitudes toward limited government and cultural conservatism, and the democracy platforms concern voting rights, investigations, legislative compromise, and the courts. A complete list of the attributes and levels in our experiment is included at the end of this document. All candidate attribute-levels are randomly selected from a predetermined set of levels. Specifically, candidate names are randomly chosen from a set of 123 names used in Butler and Homola (2017) as signals of race/ethnicity and gender. In our analysis, we will pool names into race/ethnicity and gender categories (i.e., white female, Hispanic male, black female, etc.) and estimate the AMCEs for each category, using the \u201cwhite male\u201d category as a baseline. Note that we opt to use names rather than individual attributes for race/ethnicity and gender to (1) increase the realism of the candidate profiles and (2) use fewer total attributes in the conjoint tables. All other attributes have just two levels; partisanship is randomly selected to be Democrat or Republican, each policy platform is randomly chosen to correspond to a conservative (e.g., \u201cWants to lower taxes on everyone, including the wealthy\u201d) or liberal (e.g., \u201cWants to raise taxes on the wealthy\u201d) stance, and each democracy platform is randomly chosen to correspond to a democratic norm (e.g., \u201cSaid law enforcement investigations of politicians and their associates should be free of partisan influence.\u201d) or a democratic norm transgression (e.g., \u201cSaid elected officials should supervise law enforcement investigations of politicians and their associates\u201d). The name and partisanship attributes appear first in the table, in that order, but the order of all other attributes is randomized across respondents. After viewing each pair of profiles, respondents are asked to select which candidate they would be more likely to support. They repeat this exercise a total of ten times for each candidate pair. The survey also includes a battery of demographic and attitudinal questions, a series of questions on political knowledge, and an opportunity for respondents to provide written feedback. For our main analysis, we will calculate the average marginal component effects (AMCEs) for each level of each attribute included in the conjoint. AMCEs correspond to the average effect of changing each hypothetical candidate attribute on respondents\u2019 preferences for one candidate over another, relative to a baseline level. Following Hainmueller and Hopkins (2014), we will calculate the AMCEs based on a dichotomous outcome measure indicating whether or not a given candidate was selected (the candidate rating outcome measures that were tested in 20181003AA are omitted). The treatment variables in our analysis are sets of dichotomous variables for each attribute, wherein if a given attribute has k levels, we include k - 1 dichotomous variables in our model. We estimate clustered standard errors in which each cluster is a respondent. For our analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects among respondent subgroups, we will first divide respondents into two groups using a predetermined set of criteria for each moderator (i.e., partisanship, Trump approval, political interest, political knowledge, education level, and age; see below).

As a result, few studies have considered voters\u2019 commitment to democracy in practice relative to other important considerations. Building on Graham and Svolik (2018) and Svolik (2018), we use fully randomized conjoint analysis to explore the strength of Americans\u2019 commitment to democratic values in a series of hypothetical election scenarios. Our main interest is to determine whether and to what extent voters oppose candidates who do not uphold democratic values. We test a series of competing expectations regarding popular opposition to democratic norm violations versus popular support for voter ID laws, the involvement of legislators in law enforcement investigations, unwillingness to compromise with partisan opponents, and deference to judicial authority. We also investigate (1) which specific democratic values and policy positions are most strongly related to vote choice and how those effects compare; (2) whether voters are more likely to forgive transgressions against democratic values by co-partisan candidates than opposition party candidates (and how that relationship varies by approval of Donald Trump); and (3) whether the effects of candidates acting undemocratically vary by education, political knowledge, political interest, and/or age.

Research on the \u201cfiscal link\u201d between citizens and states and concerns expressed by practitioners on the ground suggest that NGO service delivery could undermine the incentives that drive citizens to be politically engaged. However, recent work on political credit attribution suggests that government actors often receive credit for policies and programs that they are not responsible for.

To test this theory, this project leverages a large, highly effective, randomized NGO-implemented community health worker intervention in Uganda by surveying 1,600 households across 165 villages that participated the trial This field experiment --- conducted downstream from a large and highly effective cluster-randomized community health worker intervention in Uganda --- will identify the long-term effects of an NGO service delivery program that provided treated communities with a substitute for a similar government health service.

Alternatively, if citizens attribute credit to government actors for the production, distribution, or welfare effects of NGO services, the proliferation of these services may cause citizens to positively update their beliefs about government responsiveness or state capacity, increasing the expected returns to political engagement. In turn, higher levels of engagement in communities that receive NGO projects may cause governments to make complementary investments by increasing access to government services in these communities. However, improved perceptions of government performance or increased support for incumbent politicians resulting from credit attribution are likely to offset pressure from increased engagement. This project will measure the impact of the CHP intervention on one primary outcome--- political engagement -- -and five secondary outcomes that I expect to condition the effect of the intervention on political engagement: credit attribution, perceptions of government responsiveness, perceptions of state capacity, expectations of government, and complementary investments.
