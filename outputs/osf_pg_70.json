It is 88 meters (289 ft) tall, moreover, it is 50% taller than the previously considered as the tallest, Amazon\u2019s tree. Although the tallest tree has been discovered between 2016 and 2018 by the Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, in a coordinated project, during which the large swaths of the Amazon has been scanned, only recently the team of researchers actually measured the tree and claimed its title. Nevertheless, the \u2018giant\u2019 from Amazon is yet far behind the tallest tree in the world \u2013 Hyperion, from California, which is stated to be of 115.85 meters (380 ft) tall. Interestingly, the exact locations of those high kings are shrouded in mystery to prevent potential vandalism.\n\n\nCan you fold my laptop please\nAn international team of researchers has announced a new development that can change the way our laptops work, and look like. The recent trend in mobile technology, which easily spread and conquered the 2019 tech market, was based on a simple idea \u2013 to allow users to fold their devices. Foldable mobile phones have won the hearts of many people, thus, it is not surprising that the next step must have been to create foldable laptops. Thanks to the innovative solutions, a 17-inch laptop with a touchscreen became a reality. Its designers hope that the laptop will pass the initial tests successfully, and the mass production and distribution will be possible before the end of June.\n\n\nClimate change \u2013 will mankind become extinct?\nScientists from all around the world are in an agreement that climate change is a fact. The average temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times in the past. Ice is melting, and most glaciers are retrieving. This may lead not only to severe droughts in some regions, but also intense rainfalls in others. Such places as Venice could sink, and others may be at great risk of massive floods. Many predict that the devastating floods in XX century may happen again, and as a consequence, millions of people would die. Some even say that the death rate connected with climate change could reach up to 40% of the entire human population.\n\nAttention check:\nThe first press report was about:\na)\tA recently discovered tree in Amazon\nb)\tA recently discovered species of ants\nc)\tThe deepest lake in the world\n\nThe second press report was about:\na)\tNanotechnology\nb)\tNewest iPad\nc)\tFoldable laptops\n\nThe third press report was about:\na)\tClimate change\nb)\tNeanderthals in Africa\nc)\tArcheological findings in Ethiopia\n\n\n2)\tThe second group will receive the following press reports:\n\nThe new giant in Amazon\nThe new tallest tree in Amazon has been recently discovered.

It started in Wuhan, and as of the beginning of March, there have been more than 120 000 cases with a suspected disease, among which more than 4 000 people have died already. More dreadfully, among the victims of the virus are doctors, who \u2013 despite the danger, put their life at great risk and willingly take care of sick patients. But the Coronavirus takes no prisoners and has no mercy. Many compare it to the Black Death, which in the medieval Europe led to deaths of millions of people.

The average temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times in the past. Ice is melting, and most glaciers are retrieving. This may lead not only to severe droughts in some regions, but also intense rainfalls in others. Such places as Venice could sink, and others may be at great risk of massive floods. Many predict that the devastating floods in XX century may happen again, and as a consequence, millions of people would die. Some even say that the death rate connected with climate change could reach up to 40% of the entire human population.\n\nAttention check:\nThe first press report was about:\na)\tA recently discovered tree in Amazon\nb)\tA recently discovered species of ants\nc)\tThe deepest lake in the world\n\nThe second press report was about:\na)\tNanotechnology\nb)\tNewest iPad\nc)\tFoldable laptops\n\nThe third press report was about:\na)\tClimate change\nb)\tNeanderthals in Africa\nc)\tArcheological findings in Ethiopia\n\n\n2)\tThe second group will receive the following press reports:\n\nThe new giant in Amazon\nThe new tallest tree in Amazon has been recently discovered.

It started in Wuhan, and as of the beginning of March, there have been more than 120 000 cases with a suspected disease, among which more than 4 000 people have died already. More dreadfully, among the victims of the virus are doctors, who \u2013 despite the danger, put their life at great risk and willingly take care of sick patients.

A secondary goal was to examine whether having a senior manager acknowledge her struggles and anxiety resulting from the current COVID-19 crisis encourages a stronger connection with that manager, and belonging, trust, and interest in the manager\u2019s company.\n\nPrevious research has found that Black women identify more strongly and anticipant more belonging in an organization when they learn about a Black male or female successful employee at that company compared to a White female employee. That is, a successful employee with an overlapping racial identity is a more effective identity-safe cue than an employee with only an overlapping gender identity. Previous work on intersectional identities has established that Black women are more sensitive to racism then sexism. Thus, Black women are more likely to believe that Black employees have had similar experiences with past bias/adversity than White female employees. These similar experiences, in turn, relate to higher identification with the Black employee, and identifying with a successful employee ultimately encourages more interest and comfort in that employee\u2019s company. \n\nThe current research will explore whether having a White woman disclose shared adversity and struggles helps her act as an identity-safe cue for Black women. More broadly, the current research also will suggest different strategies that organizations might employee to signal they care about their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, in the current study, participants will learn about a Black or White female senior manager, who either does or does not acknowledge that she is struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this experiment, there was a significant effect of ethnicity (partial \u03b7-squared = 0.055) on belonging.

Refugees in Turkey can obtain identity cards, access to services and an employer-sponsored work permit. A reduced share, at less than 10 percent, live in camps near the Syrian border. In November 2016, the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), a refugee cash assistance program, was introduced with financial support from the European Union\u2019s (EU) Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRiT) through its humanitarian arm, The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). The program is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Family and Social Policies (MoFSP), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) as a complementary program to the national social assistance scheme for Turkish citizens. The ESSN benefits from the coordination of the national Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), an institution working to prevent disasters, coordinate post-disaster response, and promote cooperation among various government agencies in Turkey.

This makes Turkey the top refugee hosting country in the world (UNHCR 2017). Turkey\u2019s response to the refugee crisis is highlighted for its development approach, which includes a non-camp solution to the refugee influx (World Bank 2015). Refugees in Turkey can obtain identity cards, access to services and an employer-sponsored work permit. A reduced share, at less than 10 percent, live in camps near the Syrian border. In November 2016, the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), a refugee cash assistance program, was introduced with financial support from the European Union\u2019s (EU) Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRiT) through its humanitarian arm, The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO). The program is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Family and Social Policies (MoFSP), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) as a complementary program to the national social assistance scheme for Turkish citizens. The ESSN benefits from the coordination of the national Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD), an institution working to prevent disasters, coordinate post-disaster response, and promote cooperation among various government agencies in Turkey. This study assesses the impact of ESSN on the welfare of its beneficiaries using panel data from three rounds of data collection (baseline, midline, and endline).", "q16": "We will estimate the ITT effects of cash transfers to refugees in Turkey on their outcomes relating to consumption, food security, children\u2019s schooling, and labor market outcomes, as described in the attached documents (PAP and background document).", "q17": "The main identification strategy is propensity score matching, which has been specified using baseline data before researchers had access to follow-up rounds of data.
