These experiences can occur within the general population, although they are more prevalent in certain groups, such as autism spectrum conditions (Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013). In addition to a more intense subjective experience of sensory sensitivity, there is evidence of what might be described as increased behavioral sensory sensitivity (Mottron et al, 2006). Specifically, autisitic individuals show increased processing of irrelevant peripheral information to no detriment in their performance in the central task, both in the visual (e.g. Swettenham et al, 2014), and in the auditory domain (Remington &amp; Fairnie, 2017). It has hence been suggested that autistic individuals have an enhanced perceptual capacity which could underlie both advantages in these types of tasks and the sensory issues (Remington &amp; Fairne, 2017). However, the association between these individual differences in behavioral tasks and the individual\u2019s traits, especially relating to sensory issues, has, to the best of our knowledge, not been tested yet.\nIn this study, we will investigate individual differences in perceptual capacity using a subitizing task (Eayrs &amp; Lavie, 2018) as well as inattentional blindness (e.g. Cartwright-Finch &amp; Lavie, 2006), deafness  (Dalton &amp; Fraenkel, 2012) and anosmia paradigms (Forster &amp; Spence, 2018).

The task will comprise 3 slow practice trials, 6 practice trials at the actual speed of the experiment, and 3 experimental blocks of 54 trials each (6 repetitions of each of the 9 conditions per block). The order of the conditions will be randomized within each block, including the practice blocks. The items will be black squares, randomly positioned in an area subtending 7.15\u00b0 x 7.15\u00b0, randomly ranging in size between 0.38\u00b0 x 0.38\u00b0 and 3.8\u00b0 x 3.8\u00b0.\n\n- Inattentional blindness: The critical stimulus will be presented on two additional trials at the end of the subitizing task. The first of these consitutes the inattentional blindness trial, and the second is a control trial. Participants will not receive any instruction or indication prior to the first trial, but will be instructed to \"Now ignore the squares - do not indicate the number of squares on the screen. Instead, look for anything additional on the display\" before the control trial to ensure participants are capable of detecting the stimulus under low load conditions. The critical stimulus is an asterisk, randomly positioned to the left or right of the set of squares (thus counterbalanced across participants), at a constant eccentricity from the fixation cross. To ensure a consistently high load, these two trials will have a fixed set size of 6 for all participants.

Assuming similar effect sizes will apply for all sensory modalities, we used the correlations found by Eayrs &amp; Lavie, 2018, which ranged between rs=0.27 and rs=0.39, as our prior estimate. (This paper reported results for 3 separate studies which included change blindness or load-induced blindness tasks alongside the subitizing task in each. Performance in the change blindness and load-induced blindness tasks was quantified using detection sensitivity and detection rate, yielding a number of correlations within the range specified above.)  Using the upper and lower bounds of the reported effect size as a prior, a power analysis revealed that a sample size of n=46-102 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing a correlation or linear regression with a single predictor and regression coefficient (two-tailed test). \n\n- Across subjects: association between inattentional unawareness and GSQ/AQ\nThe GSQ questionnaire has only been used in one similar study (a previous student project at the University of Sussex) in which participants were divided into aware and unaware groups based on an inattentional blindness stimulus (a non-alphanumeric character presented in an unattended location during a visual search task).  Given our working assumption that the phenomenon is multi-modal, we apply the inattentional blindness effect size to inattentional deafness and inattentional anosmia (where prior effect sizes are unavailable). This study found a medium effect size (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.5) of awareness on GSQ, which we used as our prior estimate - this would correspond to a Cohen\u2019s f of 0.25  and hence a Cohen\u2019s f^2 of 0.0625 (a medium effect size for multiple regression and F tests). A power analysis revealed that a sample size of n=129 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing multiple linear regression or correlation (two-tailed test).\nFor the association between inattentional unawareness and AQ, we relied on data comparing neurotypical participants to participants diagnosed with autism spectrum conditions (Remington et al, 2012; Remington &amp; Fairnie, 2018). As the effect size calculated based on the reported results in high-load conditions is high in the visual modality (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.88), and medium in the auditory modality (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.4), we based our power analysis calculation on the smaller effect size. A power analysis revealed that a sample size of  n=199 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing multiple linear regression or correlation (two-tailed test).\n\n- Across subjects: association between subitizing capacity and GSQ/AQ\nStudies comparing neurotypical individuals and individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) report either small negative effects or no effect of ASCs on subitizing capacity (Jarrold &amp; Russell, 1997; Gagnon et al, 2004; O\u2019Hearn et al, 2013; O\u2019Hearn et al, 2015). However, it should be noted that a number of these studies include children and all focus on clinically diagnosed ASCs. Furthermore, Eayrs &amp; Lavie, 2018, show that subitizing predicted change detection rates and the performance of both tasks were underpinned by a single factor according to their confirmatory factor analysis, and there is evidence of reduced susceptibility to change blindness in autism (e.g. Swettenham et al, 2014; Smith &amp; Milne, 2009). Given the conflicting accounts for the relationship of subitizing and AQ, we do not have a prediction regarding the effect of AQ on the subitizing threshold (this part of the analysis could therefore be considered exploratory, but is detailed here for legibility.) \nIn the absence of empirical evidence on any association between the GSQ and subitizing, we assume similar effect sizes for the association between subitizing capacity and GSQ as we did for the association between inattentional unawareness and GSQ. \n"}, "q15": {"extra": [], "value": "As the main area of interest is the association of the GSQ with the performance on these behavioral tasks, we will collect a minimum of 150 complete data sets (i.e. participants who complete all 5 of the tasks and both questionnaires),  and a maximum of 200 complete data sets, with an additional cap on the total number of participants of 220, irrespective of missing or excluded data.\nWe will additionally begin calculating BFs after every additional 20 participants once we reach the minimum sample size.

", "q4": "We hypothesize that 1) self-reported sensory sensitivity as measured by the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire, (GSQ; Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013) will positively correlate with a) perceptual capacity as indexed by the subitizing threshold and b) the likelihood to detect unattended stimuli, irrespective of sensory modality, 2) self-reported autistic traits as measured by the Autism Quotient, (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al, 2001)  will positively correlate with the likelihood to detect unattended stimuli, irrespective of sensory modality, 3) the likelihood to detect unattended stimuli, irrespective of sensory modality, will correlate with the perceptual capacity as indexed by the subitizing threshold.", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.", "q6": ["No blinding is involved in this study."], "q7": "", "q9": "-Questionnaires: The order of the questions in the AQ and GSQ is randomized.\n\n- Subitizing: There will be 9 conditions corresponding to the set size, i.e. number of items (1 to 9) on the screen. The task will comprise 3 slow practice trials, 6 practice trials at the actual speed of the experiment, and 3 experimental blocks of 54 trials each (6 repetitions of each of the 9 conditions per block). The order of the conditions will be randomized within each block, including the practice blocks. The items will be black squares, randomly positioned in an area subtending 7.15\u00b0 x 7.15\u00b0, randomly ranging in size between 0.38\u00b0 x 0.38\u00b0 and 3.8\u00b0 x 3.8\u00b0.\n\n- Inattentional blindness: The critical stimulus will be presented on two additional trials at the end of the subitizing task. The first of these consitutes the inattentional blindness trial, and the second is a control trial. Participants will not receive any instruction or indication prior to the first trial, but will be instructed to \"Now ignore the squares - do not indicate the number of squares on the screen. Instead, look for anything additional on the display\" before the control trial to ensure participants are capable of detecting the stimulus under low load conditions. The critical stimulus is an asterisk, randomly positioned to the left or right of the set of squares (thus counterbalanced across participants), at a constant eccentricity from the fixation cross. To ensure a consistently high load, these two trials will have a fixed set size of 6 for all participants. The location of the critical stimulus will be the same in the control trial, to maintain all conditions but attention constant. These trials will not be used in the analysis of the subitizing task. Participants will be asked if they detected the critical stimulus and to indicate the location and identity of the stimulus after each of the two trials. The possible responses to the location and identification questions will appear in a randomly permuted order.\n\nThe remaining tasks consist of single main measures (constant across participants) and do not require randomisation.  These are two inattentional deafness tasks (noticing the presence of the word \u201cgorilla\u201d in an unattended audio stream and noticing the ambient presence of a ticking clock throughout the experiment) and inattentional anosmia (noticing the ambient aroma of coffee throughout the experiment).", "q10": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q11": "A small set of pilot data (N=13) was collected for debugging purposes and to ensure that stimuli are presented at appropriate intensity levels (such that fewer than 50% of participants notice them). This data was not analysed in relation to the hypotheses. As this study is being conducted as part of three students' undergraduate projects at the University of Sussex and the stimuli did not need adjustment, the pilot data may be used by the students due to time constraints in the data collection process, but it will not be included in any publication.\nParticipants may have already completed the questionnaires as part of a previous study. If so, we will use this existing questionnaire data, and only require participants to complete the behavioral experiments.", "q13": "We will collect a minimum of 150 complete data sets (i.e. participants who complete all 5 of the tasks and both questionnaires), and a maximum of 200 complete data sets, with an additional cap on the total number of participants of 220, irrespective of missing or excluded data.\nWe will additionally calculate Bayes factors (BF) after the minimum sample size has been collected and in batches of 20 participants thereafter. If all BFs on the following tests fall either below or above the standard threshold of \u2153 or 3 respectively, we will stop data collection: correlation between the subitizing capacity and the percentage of detected unattended stimuli, correlation between GSQ and the subitizing capacity, correlation between AQ and the subitizing capacity, correlation between GSQ and the percentage of detected unattended stimuli, correlation between AQ and the percentage of detected unattended stimuli.", "q14": "A power analysis was performed using the software program  G*Power (Erdfelder et al, 1996), for each planned test.\n\n-Within-subject correlation between perceptual capacity and inattentional unawareness\nPrior effect sizes have been noted for inattentional blindness but not other sensory modalities. Assuming similar effect sizes will apply for all sensory modalities, we used the correlations found by Eayrs &amp; Lavie, 2018, which ranged between rs=0.27 and rs=0.39, as our prior estimate. (This paper reported results for 3 separate studies which included change blindness or load-induced blindness tasks alongside the subitizing task in each. Performance in the change blindness and load-induced blindness tasks was quantified using detection sensitivity and detection rate, yielding a number of correlations within the range specified above.)  Using the upper and lower bounds of the reported effect size as a prior, a power analysis revealed that a sample size of n=46-102 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing a correlation or linear regression with a single predictor and regression coefficient (two-tailed test). \n\n- Across subjects: association between inattentional unawareness and GSQ/AQ\nThe GSQ questionnaire has only been used in one similar study (a previous student project at the University of Sussex) in which participants were divided into aware and unaware groups based on an inattentional blindness stimulus (a non-alphanumeric character presented in an unattended location during a visual search task).  Given our working assumption that the phenomenon is multi-modal, we apply the inattentional blindness effect size to inattentional deafness and inattentional anosmia (where prior effect sizes are unavailable). This study found a medium effect size (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.5) of awareness on GSQ, which we used as our prior estimate - this would correspond to a Cohen\u2019s f of 0.25  and hence a Cohen\u2019s f^2 of 0.0625 (a medium effect size for multiple regression and F tests). A power analysis revealed that a sample size of n=129 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing multiple linear regression or correlation (two-tailed test).\nFor the association between inattentional unawareness and AQ, we relied on data comparing neurotypical participants to participants diagnosed with autism spectrum conditions (Remington et al, 2012; Remington &amp; Fairnie, 2018). As the effect size calculated based on the reported results in high-load conditions is high in the visual modality (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.88), and medium in the auditory modality (Cohen\u2019s d of 0.4), we based our power analysis calculation on the smaller effect size. A power analysis revealed that a sample size of  n=199 should be sufficient to detect an effect size of this magnitude with a power of .8, assuming a significance level of .05 when performing multiple linear regression or correlation (two-tailed test).\n\n- Across subjects: association between subitizing capacity and GSQ/AQ\nStudies comparing neurotypical individuals and individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) report either small negative effects or no effect of ASCs on subitizing capacity (Jarrold &amp; Russell, 1997; Gagnon et al, 2004; O\u2019Hearn et al, 2013; O\u2019Hearn et al, 2015). However, it should be noted that a number of these studies include children and all focus on clinically diagnosed ASCs. Furthermore, Eayrs &amp; Lavie, 2018, show that subitizing predicted change detection rates and the performance of both tasks were underpinned by a single factor according to their confirmatory factor analysis, and there is evidence of reduced susceptibility to change blindness in autism (e.g. Swettenham et al, 2014; Smith &amp; Milne, 2009). Given the conflicting accounts for the relationship of subitizing and AQ, we do not have a prediction regarding the effect of AQ on the subitizing threshold (this part of the analysis could therefore be considered exploratory, but is detailed here for legibility.) \nIn the absence of empirical evidence on any association between the GSQ and subitizing, we assume similar effect sizes for the association between subitizing capacity and GSQ as we did for the association between inattentional unawareness and GSQ. \n", "q15": "As the main area of interest is the association of the GSQ with the performance on these behavioral tasks, we will collect a minimum of 150 complete data sets (i.e. participants who complete all 5 of the tasks and both questionnaires),  and a maximum of 200 complete data sets, with an additional cap on the total number of participants of 220, irrespective of missing or excluded data.\nWe will additionally begin calculating BFs after every additional 20 participants once we reach the minimum sample size. If all BFs on the following tests are either below or above the threshold of \u2153 or 3, as specified above, we will stop data collection: correlation between the subitizing capacity and the percentage of detected stimuli, correlation between GSQ and the subitizing capacity, correlation between GSQ and the percentage of detected stimuli, correlation between AQ and the percentage of detected stimuli.", "q20": "- Questionnaires: The raw scores of the two scales (AQ and GSQ) will be divided by the number of questions in order to get a raw unit in original rating units.\n\n- Inattentional blindness: Responses to the three questions will be scored as follows:\nAwareness: participants who are able to correctly identify both the shape and the location of the critical stimulus following a \u201cYes\u201d awareness response following the inattentional blindness trial.\nNo awareness: all other response combinations following the inattentional blindness trial.\n\n- Inattentional deafness (gorilla task): Responses to the three questions following the \"attend to female\" condition will be scored as follows:\nAwareness: response to question 2 contains the word \u2018gorilla\u2019\nNo awareness: response to question 2 does not contain the word \u2018gorilla\u2019\n\n- Inattentional deafness: Responses will be scored as follows:\nAwareness: response to the 1st prompt or a spontaneous comment during the experiment contains one or more of the words \u2018clock\u2019, \u2018watch\u2019, and \u2018ticking\u2019.\nNo awareness: neither the response to the 1st prompt nor a spontaneous comment during the experiment contains any of the words \u2018clock\u2019, \u2018watch\u2019, and \u2018ticking\u2019.\n\n-Inattentional anosmia: As our pilot data indicated that participants labelled the smell (when their attention was directed towards it) as either coffee or chocolate, both are considered as acceptable.\nAwareness: response to the 1st prompt or a spontaneous comment during the experiment contains the words \u2018coffee\u2019 or \u2018chocolate\u2019.\nNo awareness: neither the response to the 1st prompt nor a spontaneous comment during the experiment contains the words \u2018coffee\u2019 or \u2018chocolate\u2019.\n", "q21": "We will use frequentist and bayesian significance tests throughout.\nFor frequentist analyses, we will use the standard p = 0.05 criterion to determine if the corresponding independent variable is significantly associated with the dependent variable.

These BFs will be calculated using the ratio of scales heuristic (Dienes, 2019), in which the maximum regression slope M predicted by the theory tested is assumed to be the ratio of the lengths of the two scales being correlated.

If a participant is excluded from more than one of the inattentional unawareness tasks, the participant will be excluded from all of the other inattentional unawareness tasks but not the subitizing task. In all other cases, a participant's exclusion from a task will not affect the inclusion of their data in any other task.", "q24": "As we assume the phenomenon of inattentional unawareness to be at least partially multimodal  (e.g. Martens et al, 2010 found a correlation of 0.37 between visual attentional blink and performance on the auditory gorilla task), we expect the likelihood to detect stimuli to be correlated across sensory modalities, i.e. that people who detect one stimulus are more likely to detect all others. However, there are additional factors which should be taken into account; e.g., olfactory selective attention is particularly poor (Sela &amp; Sobel, 2010), and the critical stimuli differ on the scale of their presentation time (ambient/continuous throughout the experiment vs restricted to a specific time window in a computer-based task).
