Combining a large-scale survey experiment that tests the causal effect of priming individuals to think about agencies that punish government officials that misuse government funds on their attitudes toward taxation with novel machine learning techniques, we evaluate the moderating effect of social and economic uncertainty on the strength of the retributive justice prime. Specifically, we use advanced quantitative methods to explore variation in the strength of the retributive justice treatment effect, training causal forests to parametrically estimate features of the conditional average treatment effects across a battery of country-level characteristics."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "We hypothesize that economic and/or social uncertainty is associated with larger treatment effects for the retributive justice treatment. Specifically, we argue that economic and social uncertainty makes people more likely to value government as a provider of moral and social order and punishment that upholds order. People in contexts with relatively higher uncertainty are thus more likely to express willingness to pay taxes when reminded about the strength of top-down channels for anti-corruption. Specifically, we have two primary hypotheses: 1) Individuals in countries with relatively higher levels of economic uncertainty are more likely to have higher estimated conditional average treatment effects; and 2) Individuals in countries with relatively higher levels of social uncertainty are more likely to have higher estimated conditional average treatment effects. Our independent and dependent variables come from the original tax morale survey (already described in another Pre-Analysis Plan). We combine these data with country-level data from a variety of sources, relying primarily on data from the World Bank, the World Values Survey (Inglehart et al., 2014), and the Quality of Governance dataset (Teorell et al., 2019). The survey data collected a limited amount of individual-level data, so our analysis primarily focuses on exploring heterogeneity across country-level covariates that capture economic uncertainty, social uncertainty, and other country-level characteristics that are common controls, but unrelated to uncertainty."}, "q17": {"extra": [], "value": "We test our hypotheses about heterogeneous treatment effects as a result of uncertainty using two recent machine learning approaches. We start by implementing a nonparametric causal forest to estimate which variables are the most important for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects (Wager and Athey, 2018). We measure variable importance by looking at the reported by the grf package (Athey and Wager, 2018) \u201cvariable importance\u201d score for each covariate included in the causal forest. The variable importance measure reported by the grf package is based upon a count of the proportion of splits on the variable of interest, weighting these proportions by the depth of the tree where the split occurs, with partitions occurring at lower depths receiving a lower weight. We predict that variables related to economic and social uncertainty will have higher variable importance scores. We then cross-validate this approach by using the recent method outlined by Chernozhukov et al. (2018), which focuses on using the random forest algorithm (Friedman et al., 2009) consisting of a large number of Classificaiton and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) to estimate features of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) rather than the CATE itself because it relaxes many of the required assumptions.

Combining a large-scale survey experiment that tests the causal effect of priming individuals to think about agencies that punish government officials that misuse government funds on their attitudes toward taxation with novel machine learning techniques, we evaluate the moderating effect of social and economic uncertainty on the strength of the retributive justice prime. Specifically, we use advanced quantitative methods to explore variation in the strength of the retributive justice treatment effect, training causal forests to parametrically estimate features of the conditional average treatment effects across a battery of country-level characteristics.", "q16": "We hypothesize that economic and/or social uncertainty is associated with larger treatment effects for the retributive justice treatment. Specifically, we argue that economic and social uncertainty makes people more likely to value government as a provider of moral and social order and punishment that upholds order. People in contexts with relatively higher uncertainty are thus more likely to express willingness to pay taxes when reminded about the strength of top-down channels for anti-corruption. Specifically, we have two primary hypotheses: 1) Individuals in countries with relatively higher levels of economic uncertainty are more likely to have higher estimated conditional average treatment effects; and 2) Individuals in countries with relatively higher levels of social uncertainty are more likely to have higher estimated conditional average treatment effects. Our independent and dependent variables come from the original tax morale survey (already described in another Pre-Analysis Plan). We combine these data with country-level data from a variety of sources, relying primarily on data from the World Bank, the World Values Survey (Inglehart et al., 2014), and the Quality of Governance dataset (Teorell et al., 2019). The survey data collected a limited amount of individual-level data, so our analysis primarily focuses on exploring heterogeneity across country-level covariates that capture economic uncertainty, social uncertainty, and other country-level characteristics that are common controls, but unrelated to uncertainty.", "q17": "We test our hypotheses about heterogeneous treatment effects as a result of uncertainty using two recent machine learning approaches. We start by implementing a nonparametric causal forest to estimate which variables are the most important for predicting heterogeneous treatment effects (Wager and Athey, 2018). We measure variable importance by looking at the reported by the grf package (Athey and Wager, 2018) \u201cvariable importance\u201d score for each covariate included in the causal forest. The variable importance measure reported by the grf package is based upon a count of the proportion of splits on the variable of interest, weighting these proportions by the depth of the tree where the split occurs, with partitions occurring at lower depths receiving a lower weight. We predict that variables related to economic and social uncertainty will have higher variable importance scores. We then cross-validate this approach by using the recent method outlined by Chernozhukov et al. (2018), which focuses on using the random forest algorithm (Friedman et al., 2009) consisting of a large number of Classificaiton and Regression Trees (CART) (Breiman et al., 1984) to estimate features of the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) rather than the CATE itself because it relaxes many of the required assumptions. We focus specifically on estimating the individual-specific conditional average treatment effects, grouping those individuals into quintiles based on their predicted conditional average treatment effect, and then taking the difference in means of the included covariates between those in the highest and lowest quintile of predicted conditional average treatment effects.

A large body of social science research has demonstrated the effects of group identities on behaviors ranging from cooperation to ethnic conflict. Many football supporters consider themselves to be part of the professional clubs they support and derive some of their sense of who they are from their connection to these clubs. In addition, football supporters, like all individuals, identify to some extent with their home nation. Social identity theory suggests that both these identities (club and country) help determine the players they cheer for in league and international competitions. We are collaborating with a football fan app, Forza Football, to conduct this study. The Forza Player of the Season (POS) competition, conducted each May, provides an excellent opportunity to test the degree to which these group identities influence individuals' behavior. POS candidates have (at least) two important components to their identity: their nationality and the professional club they play for. Social identity theory predicts that Forza users should have a stronger connection to players that share their club identity compared to players who do not. The same logic holds for national identity. The basic idea of our experiment is simple: we randomly add one of these identities---club or nation---below the name displayed in the app for the POS candidates.

The purpose of this is to make a particular component of the player's identity salient, thus prompting Forza users to consider whether they share that identity before casting their vote.

Since the late 1970s, Northern Nigeria has been the site of religious and ethnic conflicts that have led to substantial violence and instability. These conflicts are thought to be fueled by the region\u2019s high rates of poverty and unemployment, as well as its large population of marginalized urban youth. Particularly notable in this context are the Almajirai, children of poor families from rural areas who migrate to cities to study in Qur\u2019anic Schools. Observers of the region worry that, due to their lack of economic opportunities, these youths become easy targets for recruitment by violent groups and criminal organizations. This study will evaluate the impact of an apprenticeship intervention delivered by the Mafita program to over 3,000 young men and women. The program is unique in targeting highly marginalized individuals, including many Almajirai.

"How does political change happen? Anyone who wants to influence politics must answer this question. There are two main hypotheses which are, at times and in different contexts, more or less correct. The elite \"republican\" theory of change is that the way to influence politics is to persuade, cajole, and motivate those with power. The mass \"democratic\" theory of change is that the way to influence politics is to organize people to engage in collective action. These theories then lend themselves to different strategies: \"lobbying\" the elite or \"mobilizing\" masses. The question then becomes: where do these theories come from? This experiment tests one hypothesis: exposure to salient examples regarding the success of a strategy will impact the willingness of individuals to engage in lobbying or mobilizing behavior. Subjects are randomly exposed to excerpts of real news reports on the political activities of the National Rifle Association (NRA). One story describes the success of the NRA as due to its financial lobbying activities. The second story describes the success of the NRA as due to its mobilization of collective action by its members. I propose that those who are exposed to the a mobilization (lobbying) narrative are more (less) likely to (1) have higher external efficacy (belief that average citizens can influence politics), (2) are more likely to report \"mass mobilization\" strategies as influential, and (3) are more likely to report a willingness to participate in mass mobilization. Furthermore, I argue that lobbying narratives increase willingness to engage in \"out of system\" forms of participation, as the system itself loses credibility. In a political environment in which the influence of \"special interests\" is a salient narrative on both sides of the aisle, I argue the omnipresence of this narrative actually makes that narrative truer."}, "q16": {"extra": [], "value": "Hypothesis 1a: Manipulation check Exposure to a mobilization narrative will increase the belief that the NRA's success is due to recruitment of members.

Anyone who wants to influence politics must answer this question. There are two main hypotheses which are, at times and in different contexts, more or less correct. The elite \"republican\" theory of change is that the way to influence politics is to persuade, cajole, and motivate those with power. The mass \"democratic\" theory of change is that the way to influence politics is to organize people to engage in collective action. These theories then lend themselves to different strategies: \"lobbying\" the elite or \"mobilizing\" masses. The question then becomes: where do these theories come from? This experiment tests one hypothesis: exposure to salient examples regarding the success of a strategy will impact the willingness of individuals to engage in lobbying or mobilizing behavior. Subjects are randomly exposed to excerpts of real news reports on the political activities of the National Rifle Association (NRA). One story describes the success of the NRA as due to its financial lobbying activities. The second story describes the success of the NRA as due to its mobilization of collective action by its members. I propose that those who are exposed to the a mobilization (lobbying) narrative are more (less) likely to (1) have higher external efficacy (belief that average citizens can influence politics), (2) are more likely to report \"mass mobilization\" strategies as influential, and (3) are more likely to report a willingness to participate in mass mobilization. Furthermore, I argue that lobbying narratives increase willingness to engage in \"out of system\" forms of participation, as the system itself loses credibility. In a political environment in which the influence of \"special interests\" is a salient narrative on both sides of the aisle, I argue the omnipresence of this narrative actually makes that narrative truer.", "q16": "Hypothesis 1a: Manipulation check Exposure to a mobilization narrative will increase the belief that the NRA's success is due to recruitment of members.

The return and reintegration of thousands of IDPs to areas recaptured from IS raises important questions for communities that have been divided between supporters and opponents of IS.

Mosul, an Iraqi city that was recaptured by Iraqi forces in 2017 after more than three years of control and governance by the Islamic State (IS) is an ideal site in which to seek answers to these questions, which are crucial to the stabilization and reconstruction of war-torn societies around the world. The return and reintegration of thousands of IDPs to areas recaptured from IS raises important questions for communities that have been divided between supporters and opponents of IS. Will these returnees be able to trust and coexist peacefully with those who stayed in IS-controlled Mosul and cooperated with the group to varying extents? Does willingness to forgive rebel collaborators depend on the nature of the punishment he or she has received (ranging from more lenient and restorative punishments such as community service to harsher ones such as imprisonment)? Through two embedded experiments in an original survey of 1,400 residents of Mosul, we will identify the effects of hypothetical collaborators' identity and the type of collaboration on respondents\u2019 preferences for punishment, forgiveness, and reintegration.", "q16": "See attached pre-analysis plan.", "q17": "See attached pre-analysis plan.", "q18": "Iraq", "q19": "1,400",

Essentially, the objective of this exercise is to establish a baseline for voters\u2019 assessments of female/male politicians in Brazil. In the survey, participants were asked to select six positive and six negative attributes of politicians they found to be the most desirable and undesirable, respectively, and then to assess the extent to which each of these terms were masculine or feminine. For each of the twenty-five words in each list, we then code binary variables in which 0 signifies that a respondent did not select the word, and 1 signifies that a respondent selected the word. This variable is used to assess the frequency in which each term was selected, thus allowing us to identify the most important positive and negative attributes according to voters. We assess voters\u2019 top preferences by calculating frequency distributions for each word for the entire sample of respondents; to verify the robustness of these preferences, we also conduct sub-group analyses across sex (male/female); race (white/non-white); age (44 and under/45 and older); income (up to 2 minimum wages/more than 2 minimum wages); partisanship (PT partisans/non-partisans and Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters); and, regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South). We then assess the extent to which voters characterize top positive and negative attributes as feminine or masculine using the variables attributeX_gendered , which capture individuals\u2019 assessment of each word they selected and for which: -2 refers to \u201cvery masculine,\u201d -1 to \u201csomewhat masculine,\u201d 0 to \u201cneither masculine or feminine,\u201d 1 to \u201csomewhat feminine,\u201d and 2 to \u201cvery feminine.\u201d We conducted this analysis as before: by calculating the mean values of each variable for the entire sample of respondents; to verify the robustness of these preferences, we also conduct sub-group analyses across sex (male/female); race (white/non-white); age (44 and under/45 and older); income (up to 2 minimum wages/more than 2 minimum wages); partisanship (PT partisans/non-partisans and Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters); and, regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South). H2) H2-H5b will be tested using experimental survey data collected with a nationally-representative sample of Brazilian voters (N=1,500). H2a and H2b will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 D-scores, by treatment and control groups. As per Greenwald et al. (2003), D-scores are calculated using respondents\u2019 scores on blocks 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the IAT and capture respondents\u2019 implicit associations in respect to women\u2019s fitness for office. D-scores can be calculated in three different ways, depending on the set-up of the IAT. We use the default D-score calculation provided by IATgen. D-scores have a possible range of -2 to 2, with positive values pertaining to a positive bias pertaining to women\u2019s fit for office, and a score of 0 referring to no gender-based bias. Because we are interested in average effects across treatment and control groups, but also anticipate heterogeneous effects across gender and partisan lines, we also conduct T-tests by treatment and control groups among sub-groups of participants. Namely, female/male; PT partisans/non-partisans; Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters. As additional tests, we also conduct T-tests of average reaction times for male political positions and average reaction times for female political positions. This means that we take the male political position average reaction time from the T-test output for female participants, and the male political position average reaction time for male participants. This is done as a means of further assessing the degree of masculinity assigned to positive or negative attributes. H3) H3 will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 answers to explicit questions pertaining to women\u2019s fit for office (as specified below), by treatment and control groups. To confirm that null effects persist, we assess potential heterogeneous effects across gender and partisan lines. As such, we also conduct T-tests by treatment and control groups among sub-groups of participants. Namely, female/male; PT partisans/non-partisans; Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters. Have you ever voted for Dilma for President, or another woman for President or any other office? (Please mark all that apply). Yes, I voted for Dilma Rousseff for President (1) I voted for another woman for President (1) I voted for a woman for Governor (1) I voted for a woman for Mayor (1) I voted for a woman for Senator (1) I voted for a woman for Federal Deputy (1) I voted for a woman for State Deputy (1) I voted for a woman for Municipal Deputy (1) No, I have never voted for a woman (0) No, I have never voted or would vote for a woman (-1) \u2022 Scores to this question correspondents to summative value of all positive answers, thus possibly ranging from -1 to 8. To what extend do you agree with the statement: \u201cDilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment is evidence that women IN GENERAL are less competent politicians than men\u201d. 0 = Completely agree. 1 = Somewhat agree. 2 = Somewhat disagree. 3 = Completely disagree. H4) H4 will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 answers to questions about their self-evaluations to run for office (as specified below), by treatment and control groups. As per the literature on symbolic representation, we only derive expectations for the ways in which the treatment might impact women (but not men). As such, we anticipate heterogeneous effects across gender, thus conducting T-tests by treatment and control groups among female respondents. How would you classify your qualifications to occupy elected office? 0 = Extremely unqualified 1 = Somewhat unqualified 2 = Somewhat qualified 3 = Extremely qualified How likely are you to run for office? 0 = Extremely unlikely 1 = Somewhat unlikely 3 = Somewhat likely 4 = Extremely likely H5) H5 a and b will be tested by assessing the difference in aggregate means of respondents\u2019 answers to the list experiment before and after being debriefed about the purpose of the IAT (see questions below). As per the set-up of list experiments, individual-level analyses are not possible, only being possible to assess the ways in which exposure to the debrief impacted before and after aggregate outcomes. This means that respondents\u2019 individual answers to the debrief question are not taken into account in the analysis of list experiments. List experiment 1: The experiences encapsulated in the statements below sometimes make people upset or uncomfortable. After reading all four statements, select HOW MANY of them upset you (not which ones, just how many). Young people making graffiti on the streets Political parties electing more female than male candidates (sensitive item) Students not having access to books People cutting line at the bank because of conditions of priority (e.g., age, pregnancy) IAT debrief: Almost everyone unconsciously makes associations based on gender stereotypes. This makes people perceive men or women as more skilled in a given area. The timed activity in the previous section measured the way you unconsciously rate the performance of men and women in politics. If you had to guess, how do you think was your rating in this activity? In other words, would you say that you unconsciously prefer men or women to exercise political office? To answer the question, complete the following statement with one of the options below: \u201cI think that, unconsciously, I make\u2026\u201d -3 = Strong association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. -2 = Moderate association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. -1 = Slight association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 0 = No association between sex and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 1 = Slight association between women and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 2 = Moderate association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 3 = Strong association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office.

We assess voters\u2019 top preferences by calculating frequency distributions for each word for the entire sample of respondents; to verify the robustness of these preferences, we also conduct sub-group analyses across sex (male/female); race (white/non-white); age (44 and under/45 and older); income (up to 2 minimum wages/more than 2 minimum wages); partisanship (PT partisans/non-partisans and Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters); and, regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South). We then assess the extent to which voters characterize top positive and negative attributes as feminine or masculine using the variables attributeX_gendered , which capture individuals\u2019 assessment of each word they selected and for which: -2 refers to \u201cvery masculine,\u201d -1 to \u201csomewhat masculine,\u201d 0 to \u201cneither masculine or feminine,\u201d 1 to \u201csomewhat feminine,\u201d and 2 to \u201cvery feminine.\u201d We conducted this analysis as before: by calculating the mean values of each variable for the entire sample of respondents; to verify the robustness of these preferences, we also conduct sub-group analyses across sex (male/female); race (white/non-white); age (44 and under/45 and older); income (up to 2 minimum wages/more than 2 minimum wages); partisanship (PT partisans/non-partisans and Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters); and, regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South). H2) H2-H5b will be tested using experimental survey data collected with a nationally-representative sample of Brazilian voters (N=1,500). H2a and H2b will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 D-scores, by treatment and control groups. As per Greenwald et al. (2003), D-scores are calculated using respondents\u2019 scores on blocks 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the IAT and capture respondents\u2019 implicit associations in respect to women\u2019s fitness for office. D-scores can be calculated in three different ways, depending on the set-up of the IAT. We use the default D-score calculation provided by IATgen. D-scores have a possible range of -2 to 2, with positive values pertaining to a positive bias pertaining to women\u2019s fit for office, and a score of 0 referring to no gender-based bias. Because we are interested in average effects across treatment and control groups, but also anticipate heterogeneous effects across gender and partisan lines, we also conduct T-tests by treatment and control groups among sub-groups of participants. Namely, female/male; PT partisans/non-partisans; Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters. As additional tests, we also conduct T-tests of average reaction times for male political positions and average reaction times for female political positions. This means that we take the male political position average reaction time from the T-test output for female participants, and the male political position average reaction time for male participants. This is done as a means of further assessing the degree of masculinity assigned to positive or negative attributes. H3) H3 will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 answers to explicit questions pertaining to women\u2019s fit for office (as specified below), by treatment and control groups. To confirm that null effects persist, we assess potential heterogeneous effects across gender and partisan lines. As such, we also conduct T-tests by treatment and control groups among sub-groups of participants. Namely, female/male; PT partisans/non-partisans; Dilma voters/non-Dilma voters. Have you ever voted for Dilma for President, or another woman for President or any other office? (Please mark all that apply). Yes, I voted for Dilma Rousseff for President (1) I voted for another woman for President (1) I voted for a woman for Governor (1) I voted for a woman for Mayor (1) I voted for a woman for Senator (1) I voted for a woman for Federal Deputy (1) I voted for a woman for State Deputy (1) I voted for a woman for Municipal Deputy (1) No, I have never voted for a woman (0) No, I have never voted or would vote for a woman (-1) \u2022 Scores to this question correspondents to summative value of all positive answers, thus possibly ranging from -1 to 8. To what extend do you agree with the statement: \u201cDilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment is evidence that women IN GENERAL are less competent politicians than men\u201d. 0 = Completely agree. 1 = Somewhat agree. 2 = Somewhat disagree. 3 = Completely disagree. H4) H4 will be tested by conducting T-tests of the differences in means of respondents\u2019 answers to questions about their self-evaluations to run for office (as specified below), by treatment and control groups. As per the literature on symbolic representation, we only derive expectations for the ways in which the treatment might impact women (but not men). As such, we anticipate heterogeneous effects across gender, thus conducting T-tests by treatment and control groups among female respondents. How would you classify your qualifications to occupy elected office? 0 = Extremely unqualified 1 = Somewhat unqualified 2 = Somewhat qualified 3 = Extremely qualified How likely are you to run for office? 0 = Extremely unlikely 1 = Somewhat unlikely 3 = Somewhat likely 4 = Extremely likely H5) H5 a and b will be tested by assessing the difference in aggregate means of respondents\u2019 answers to the list experiment before and after being debriefed about the purpose of the IAT (see questions below). As per the set-up of list experiments, individual-level analyses are not possible, only being possible to assess the ways in which exposure to the debrief impacted before and after aggregate outcomes. This means that respondents\u2019 individual answers to the debrief question are not taken into account in the analysis of list experiments. List experiment 1: The experiences encapsulated in the statements below sometimes make people upset or uncomfortable. After reading all four statements, select HOW MANY of them upset you (not which ones, just how many). Young people making graffiti on the streets Political parties electing more female than male candidates (sensitive item) Students not having access to books People cutting line at the bank because of conditions of priority (e.g., age, pregnancy) IAT debrief: Almost everyone unconsciously makes associations based on gender stereotypes. This makes people perceive men or women as more skilled in a given area. The timed activity in the previous section measured the way you unconsciously rate the performance of men and women in politics. If you had to guess, how do you think was your rating in this activity? In other words, would you say that you unconsciously prefer men or women to exercise political office? To answer the question, complete the following statement with one of the options below: \u201cI think that, unconsciously, I make\u2026\u201d -3 = Strong association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. -2 = Moderate association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. -1 = Slight association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 0 = No association between sex and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 1 = Slight association between women and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 2 = Moderate association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. 3 = Strong association between men and one\u2019s capacity to occupy political office. List experiment 2: The experiences encapsulated in the statements below sometimes make people upset or uncomfortable. After reading all four statements, select HOW MANY of them upset you (not which ones, just how many).
