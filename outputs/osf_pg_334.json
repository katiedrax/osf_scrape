According to Wegner, conscious will is experienced when we infer that our thoughts have caused an action. The illusion of conscious will (perceived sense of authorship over an action) occurs when three things are maintained: (1) priority -- when a thought appears in consciousness just before an action; (2) consistency -- when the thought is consistent with the action; and (3) exclusivity -- when the thought is not accompanied with other alternative causes of the action.
