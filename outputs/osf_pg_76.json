Previous research has to a large extent focused on identifying the determinants influencing patients\u2019 engagement with an electronic health record, and what the benefits are of an active patient engagement  on (shared) decision making processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. What is lacking from these previous reviews, however, is in-depth insight into the variability in frequency and consistency of patient engagement and which patient-, care- and PEHR-related factors influence these frequencies. Moreover, since previous reviews did not specify the type of data managed by patients, it is still unknown to what extent patients actively manage their core health data (i.e., information about patients\u2019 medication regimen, vaccinations, allergies, medical and family history, and intoxications) in a PEHR. We further aim to identify the extent to which patients feel motivated and/or co-responsible (\u201cempowered\u201d) to actively use their PEHR to manage their core health data, and to what extent this engagement with a PEHR impacts the quality and safety of care, and patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 satisfaction with the care being delivered. We believe that the answers to these questions will allow us to provide clear recommendations, in terms of information/education guidelines, and/or portal requirements, to stimulate an active patient involvement with a PEHR.\n\nIn this scoping review, we aim to identify different engagement profiles. Our scoping review, therefore, aims to answer the following questions: Which proportion of patients view, review, enter, update and/or remove their core health data in a PEHR? Which patient-, PEHR-, and care-related determinants (i.e., barriers and drivers) influence these different proportions, and which patient-, PEHR-, and care-related determinants affect an active, ongoing patient involvement? What are patients\u2019 perceptions and expectations of an active patient engagement on the safety and quality of health care? Finally, we aim to answer whether these perceptions are accurate by identifying the benefits and costs that are related to an active patient involvement with a PEHR.\n\n\nSearch strategy and eligibility criteria \n\nThis scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR; Tricco et al., 2018). In March 2020, we will search the following databases: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We will also hand search the reference list of all primary and review articles. We will exclude literature reviews, but include practice briefs, fact sheets, white papers, and peer-reviewed publications (including conference proceedings) focusing on any type of population or study design (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mix-method studies). We will search the databases for articles published from January 2000  to February 2020, and we will only retrieve articles that were written in either English or Dutch.\n\nOur search strategy will target words for electronic health records (e.g., patient portal, electronic health record), combined with terms that are related to patient engagement (e.g., patient participation, patient education, patient involvement, patient engagement), and the type of data being entered (e.g., medication reconciliation, medication verification, allergies, intoxications). \n\nTo be included in the review, papers need to focus on patients entering their (core) health data in an online patient portal, and identify either patient-, PEHR-, or care-related determinants (i.e., perceived or examined attitudes, expectations, barriers and drivers) that influence patient involvement, or focus on the (perceivers or examined) benefits or costs that are related to an active patient involvement with a PEHR. Papers will be excluded when patients managing their (core) health data in a PEHR is a secondary concept in the paper. See Table 1 (in Supplemental files) for an overview of the checklist for full articles. \n\n\nData extraction\n\nThe retrieved articles will be imported into Mendeley, and the first author (DD) will use this software to screen the articles and to select eligible papers based on their titles and abstracts. After this initial screening, the third author (KS) will screen a subset (10%) of the papers that were judged by the first author. This subset will contain a mix of excluded and included papers. Disagreements between the first and third author will be resolved by inviting a third reviewer (fourth author, MH) to discuss the problematic cases. We will commence with the second round of screening when the inter-rater agreement (kappa) between the first and third author is at least moderate (min.60; [8]). In the second round of screening, the first and third author will evaluate the selected articles from the first round based on the eligibility criteria. Again, disagreements will be resolved in discussion with the fourth author. See Table 2 (in Supplemental files) for the data extraction items.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Antonio, M.

Previous research has to a large extent focused on identifying the determinants influencing patients\u2019 engagement with an electronic health record, and what the benefits are of an active patient engagement  on (shared) decision making processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. What is lacking from these previous reviews, however, is in-depth insight into the variability in frequency and consistency of patient engagement and which patient-, care- and PEHR-related factors influence these frequencies. Moreover, since previous reviews did not specify the type of data managed by patients, it is still unknown to what extent patients actively manage their core health data (i.e., information about patients\u2019 medication regimen, vaccinations, allergies, medical and family history, and intoxications) in a PEHR. We further aim to identify the extent to which patients feel motivated and/or co-responsible (\u201cempowered\u201d) to actively use their PEHR to manage their core health data, and to what extent this engagement with a PEHR impacts the quality and safety of care, and patients\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 satisfaction with the care being delivered. We believe that the answers to these questions will allow us to provide clear recommendations, in terms of information/education guidelines, and/or portal requirements, to stimulate an active patient involvement with a PEHR.\n\nIn this scoping review, we aim to identify different engagement profiles. Our scoping review, therefore, aims to answer the following questions: Which proportion of patients view, review, enter, update and/or remove their core health data in a PEHR? Which patient-, PEHR-, and care-related determinants (i.e., barriers and drivers) influence these different proportions, and which patient-, PEHR-, and care-related determinants affect an active, ongoing patient involvement? What are patients\u2019 perceptions and expectations of an active patient engagement on the safety and quality of health care? Finally, we aim to answer whether these perceptions are accurate by identifying the benefits and costs that are related to an active patient involvement with a PEHR.\n\n\nSearch strategy and eligibility criteria \n\nThis scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR; Tricco et al., 2018). In March 2020, we will search the following databases: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We will also hand search the reference list of all primary and review articles. We will exclude literature reviews, but include practice briefs, fact sheets, white papers, and peer-reviewed publications (including conference proceedings) focusing on any type of population or study design (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mix-method studies). We will search the databases for articles published from January 2000  to February 2020, and we will only retrieve articles that were written in either English or Dutch.\n\nOur search strategy will target words for electronic health records (e.g., patient portal, electronic health record), combined with terms that are related to patient engagement (e.g., patient participation, patient education, patient involvement, patient engagement), and the type of data being entered (e.g., medication reconciliation, medication verification, allergies, intoxications). \n\nTo be included in the review, papers need to focus on patients entering their (core) health data in an online patient portal, and identify either patient-, PEHR-, or care-related determinants (i.e., perceived or examined attitudes, expectations, barriers and drivers) that influence patient involvement, or focus on the (perceivers or examined) benefits or costs that are related to an active patient involvement with a PEHR. Papers will be excluded when patients managing their (core) health data in a PEHR is a secondary concept in the paper. See Table 1 (in Supplemental files) for an overview of the checklist for full articles. \n\n\nData extraction\n\nThe retrieved articles will be imported into Mendeley, and the first author (DD) will use this software to screen the articles and to select eligible papers based on their titles and abstracts. After this initial screening, the third author (KS) will screen a subset (10%) of the papers that were judged by the first author. This subset will contain a mix of excluded and included papers. Disagreements between the first and third author will be resolved by inviting a third reviewer (fourth author, MH) to discuss the problematic cases. We will commence with the second round of screening when the inter-rater agreement (kappa) between the first and third author is at least moderate (min.60; [8]). In the second round of screening, the first and third author will evaluate the selected articles from the first round based on the eligibility criteria. Again, disagreements will be resolved in discussion with the fourth author. See Table 2 (in Supplemental files) for the data extraction items.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Antonio, M.

In a previous project from our lab (G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2019; https://osf.io/7xrst/), we found that participants on the political left reported higher IH. The proposed study will aim to replicate and expand on this result by using measures of social and economic conservatism, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, dogmatism, and specific attitude measures that will lay the groundwork for the behavioral task that we\u2019ll use in a later study.

But since this finding was exploratory, and for the sake of theoretical richness, I will compare several predictions derived from the literature on how epistemic motivations and cognitive rigidity/flexibility relate to ideology. The studies upon which these predictions were based did not use IH specifically but they used its correlates (e.g., Openness, low Need for Closure, low dogmatism, cognitive flexibility, etc.). Therefore they can be adapted to IH according to the direction of IH\u2019s relationship with these variables. Here are the hypotheses for IH and ideology:\n\nAsymmetry (a. k. a. rigidity-of-the-right, see Jost et al., 2003b for a review): IH will be negatively related to conservatism/right-wing ideology.\n\nModerated asymmetry (Federico &amp; Ekstrom, 2018; see Federico &amp; Malka, 2018 for a review of moderators): IH will be negatively related to conservatism/right-wing ideology, but\nthe relationship will interact with political identity centrality, such that the ideological asymmetry in IH will be greater among those who see their political identity as more central.\n\nRigidity-of-the-extreme (see van Prooijen &amp; Krouwel, 2019 for a recent review): There will be a reverse U-shaped relationship between IH and ideology, such that those on the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum will have lower IH than those closer to the center.\n\nIntegration of rigidity-of-the-right and rigidity-of-the-extreme hypotheses (Jost et al., 2003a, fig. 2c): There will be a reverse U-shaped relationship between IH and ideology, such that extremists will report lower IH, but the slope will be steeper on the right side of the breaking point.\n\nSymmetry: There will be no linear or quadratic relationship between IH and ideology.\n\nGeneral Intellectual Humility Scale will be used as the main IH measure to test these hypotheses. The main measure of ideology will be the 7-point ideological self-placement question, but the same hypotheses will also be tested using Social Conservatism Scale and Right-Wing Authoritarianism, since these are also expected to behave similarly to the main measure. No relationship is expected between IH and economic conservatism.\n\nAlso related to the central goal of this project are the hypotheses regarding religiosity and dogmatism. Based on the previous finding from our lab (https://osf.io/7xrst/), I expect religiosity to be negatively related to IH. For Dogmatism, IH literature points to a clear direction (Haggard et al., 2018; Hoyle et al., 2016; Leary et al., 2017): Based on these, I expect that Dogmatism will be negatively related to IH.\n\nThe remaining predictions are not directly relevant to the aim of this project but will be tested to replicate the findings in our previous project (https://osf.io/7xrst/):\n\nHolistic thinking (measured by Analysis-Holism Scale) will positively predict IH scores above and beyond social desirability and reflective thinking (measured by Cognitive Reflection Test).\n\nDisdain toward the Ignorant items of Social Vigilantism Scale (see Measured Variables section) will positively correlate with GIHS.\n"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

The minimum number of participants will be based on the smallest effect size from G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) that are of primary interest. This happens to be the GIHS - religiosity relationship, r = -.21. According to G*Power (v 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., 2007), 236 participants are required to achieve 95% power to find this effect when \u03b1 = .05 (one-tail).

This happens to be the counterintuitive relationship between GIHS and Disdain subscale of Social Vigilantism (r = .16).

Since it showed stronger correlations (compared to LOIHS) with our variables of interest in that project, hypotheses, and the power analysis for the proposed study are based on this scale.\n\nLimitations-Owning Intellectual Humility Scale (LOIHS; Haggard et al., 2018): Like GIHS, this scale was also adapted to Turkish for G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). Although it\u2019s not the primary measure of IH for this study, it is included to replicate the IH-holistic thinking relationship in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. It uses a 9-point Likert scale and has 3 subscales with 4 items in each: Love of Learning (e.g., \u201cIf I don't understand something, I try to get clear about what exactly is confusing to me.\u201d), Appropriate Discomfort with Limitations [e.g., \u201cI tend to get defensive about my intellectual limitations and weaknesses.\u201d (reverse coded)], and Owning Limitations (e.g., \u201cWhen someone points out a mistake in my thinking, I am quick to admit that I was wrong.\u201d). \n\nAnalysis-Holism Scale (AHS; Choi et al., 2007): Although not directly related to the questions of this proposal, this scale will be included to replicate the positive relationship between IH and holistic thinking that was found in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). AHS is a measure of holistic thinking \u2014 a cultural thinking style that encompasses attention to context, expectation of constant and non-linear change, tolerance of contradictions, and a more complex understanding of causality. These principles, grounded in Chinese philosophy (Peng et al., 2006; Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018), are measured with 4 subscales: Causality, (e.g., \u201cEverything in the world is intertwined in a causal relationship.\u201d), Attitude Toward Contradictions (e.g., \u201cIt is more desirable to take the middle ground than go to extremes.\u201d), Perception of Change [e.g., \u201cEvery phenomenon in the world moves in predictable directions.\u201d (reverse coded)] and Locus of Attention (e.g., \u201cThe whole, rather than its parts, should be considered in order to understand a phenomenon.\u201d). This scale was first adapted to Turkish and modified in Sar\u0131bay, \u015eencan, &amp; G\u00fcng\u00f6r (2018, unpublished); this version has 29 items in total and uses a 7-point Likert scale  (see https://osf.io/q8vey/ for the modifications).\n\nRight-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA; Altemeyer, 1996): RWA is a measure of attitudes towards preserving traditional values and hostility toward groups that go against them. Krumrei-Mancuso (2018) suggested that it might mediate the IH-religiosity relationship. Its Turkish adaptation (to be taken from https://www.moralintuitionslab.com/materials) contains 22 items and uses a 9-point Likert scale.\n\nDogmatism (Tolunay, 2001): This scale was a combination of original items and items taken from various other measures including Rokeach\u2019s (1960) Dogmatism scale and California F scale (Titus &amp; Hollander, 1957). It is included to replicate IH\u2019s negative correlation with Dogmatism (Haggard et al., 2018; Hoyle et al., 2016; Leary et al., 2017).\n\nSocial Vigilantism (SV; Saucier &amp; Webster, 2010): SV measures how much a person believes that their ideas are superior and must be adopted by others. Leary et al. (2017) and Haggard et al. (2018) both found null relationships between SV and IH; these results were inconsistent with the predictions of the former, but confirmed those of the latter (see Whitcomb et al., 2017 for a discussion of why IH should be unrelated to the estimation of intellectual strengths). G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) similarly found a null result, but also conducted confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses to show that it might be more productive to divide SV into 3 subscales: Responsibility for Educating Others (e.g., \u201cI feel a social obligation to voice my opinion.\u201d), Imposing One\u2019s Ideas (e.g., \u201cIf everyone saw things the way that I do, the world would be a better place.\u201d), and Disdain toward the Ignorant (e.g., \u201cThere are a lot of ignorant people in society.\u201d) (see Table 2 in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2019 for the full list). It is included in this study to replicate the positive GIHS-Disdain relationship in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). \n\nSelf-Deception subscale of Social Desirability Scale (SD; Ak\u0131n, 2010): This 13-item subscale is similar to the one in Paulhus\u2019 (1988) Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding. It measures overconfidence in one\u2019s decisions and reasoning. SD will be included because it was a covariate in the model in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) that we want to replicate (i.e., IH-AHS relationship).\n\nThe attention check question (\"I have never ridden in a car.\") will be presented with the social desirability items.\n\nCognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005): CRT measures the tendency to engage in reflective thinking versus intuitive thinking. It is composed of 3 questions with \u201cbaits\u201d that immediately jump to mind; participants have to resist this intuitive answer to eventually find the correct one (e.g. \u201cIf it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\u201d, the intuitive and wrong answer is 100 and the reflective and correct answer is 5). It is included for its relevance to the reasoning task in the second upcoming study.\n\nBeliefs about the conclusions in the syllogism task: Participants will answer the question \u201cHow much do you believe in or agree with this statement?\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10 for the sentences that they will see in the reasoning task that will be used in the second study. \n\nAbbreviated Specific Intellectual Humility Scale (Hoyle, Davisson, Diebels, &amp; Leary, 2016). Hoyle and colleagues\u2019 (2016) 5-point abbreviated version of this scale consists of 3 items: \u201cMy views about _______ today may someday turn out to be wrong.\u201d, \u201cWhen it comes to my views about _______ I may be overlooking evidence.\u201d, \u201cMy views about _______ may change with additional evidence or information.\u201d This scale will be adapted to Turkish for this project. Participants will be instructed to fill out these scales for the topics based on their responses in the previous page (believability ratings).\n\nPolitical orientation and political identity centrality: In addition to the one-item political orientation question, participants will complete social and economic conservatism measures from Y\u0131lmaz &amp; Sar\u0131bay (2016). Participants will also be asked to choose a category that best defines their ideology (conservative, social democrat, nationalist, etc.) and then to answer \"How important is it for you to define yourself with this category?\" This question will be used as a proxy for political identity centrality.\n\nReligiosity: Participants will answer the question: \u201cDo you consider yourself to be a religious person?\u201d (on a 0-100 scale).\n\nDemographics: Participants will be asked several demographic questions such as their gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) during childhood, hometown size.

To test the GIHS - Disdain (Social Vigilantism) relationship, two-tailed Pearson\u2019s correlation will be used since the effect could be expected to go the opposite of what we found in the previous project.\n\nFor the moderated asymmetry hypothesis, I will build separate regression models with ideology variables (self-placement, social conservatism, RWA) as DVs. The covariates for the models will be IH, political identity centrality, and the interaction of the two. If the interaction is significant, it will be followed up by a simple slope analysis to look at the IH-ideology relationship at different levels of political identity centrality.\n\nFor the rigidity-of-the-extreme hypothesis, I will use the two lines test (Simonsohn, 2018), with ideology as the predictor and IH as the outcome. If there is a significant quadratic relationship, I will divide the sample from the break point provided by the algorithm and compare correlations.\n\nFor null results, (as predicted for IH-economic conservatism, for example) equivalence tests will be conducted.\n\nTo replicate the IH-holistic thinking relationship, I will build a regression model with IH as the outcome variable.

But since this finding was exploratory, and for the sake of theoretical richness, I will compare several predictions derived from the literature on how epistemic motivations and cognitive rigidity/flexibility relate to ideology. The studies upon which these predictions were based did not use IH specifically but they used its correlates (e.g., Openness, low Need for Closure, low dogmatism, cognitive flexibility, etc.). Therefore they can be adapted to IH according to the direction of IH\u2019s relationship with these variables. Here are the hypotheses for IH and ideology:\n\nAsymmetry (a. k. a. rigidity-of-the-right, see Jost et al., 2003b for a review): IH will be negatively related to conservatism/right-wing ideology.\n\nModerated asymmetry (Federico &amp; Ekstrom, 2018; see Federico &amp; Malka, 2018 for a review of moderators): IH will be negatively related to conservatism/right-wing ideology, but\nthe relationship will interact with political identity centrality, such that the ideological asymmetry in IH will be greater among those who see their political identity as more central.\n\nRigidity-of-the-extreme (see van Prooijen &amp; Krouwel, 2019 for a recent review): There will be a reverse U-shaped relationship between IH and ideology, such that those on the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum will have lower IH than those closer to the center.\n\nIntegration of rigidity-of-the-right and rigidity-of-the-extreme hypotheses (Jost et al., 2003a, fig. 2c): There will be a reverse U-shaped relationship between IH and ideology, such that extremists will report lower IH, but the slope will be steeper on the right side of the breaking point.\n\nSymmetry: There will be no linear or quadratic relationship between IH and ideology.\n\nGeneral Intellectual Humility Scale will be used as the main IH measure to test these hypotheses. The main measure of ideology will be the 7-point ideological self-placement question, but the same hypotheses will also be tested using Social Conservatism Scale and Right-Wing Authoritarianism, since these are also expected to behave similarly to the main measure. No relationship is expected between IH and economic conservatism.\n\nAlso related to the central goal of this project are the hypotheses regarding religiosity and dogmatism. Based on the previous finding from our lab (https://osf.io/7xrst/), I expect religiosity to be negatively related to IH. For Dogmatism, IH literature points to a clear direction (Haggard et al., 2018; Hoyle et al., 2016; Leary et al., 2017): Based on these, I expect that Dogmatism will be negatively related to IH.\n\nThe remaining predictions are not directly relevant to the aim of this project but will be tested to replicate the findings in our previous project (https://osf.io/7xrst/):\n\nHolistic thinking (measured by Analysis-Holism Scale) will positively predict IH scores above and beyond social desirability and reflective thinking (measured by Cognitive Reflection Test).\n\nDisdain toward the Ignorant items of Social Vigilantism Scale (see Measured Variables section) will positively correlate with GIHS.\n", "q3": "Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment.

After this point, I am going to collect data to increase power until I hit one of the two stopping rules (see below).\n", "q12": "I set the minimum and maximum number of participants based on the smallest effects from our previous project (G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2019; https://osf.io/7xrst/) that I want to replicate, depending on the level of interest (i.e., primary vs. secondary) and relevance to the current project. The minimum number of participants will be based on the smallest effect size from G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) that are of primary interest. This happens to be the GIHS - religiosity relationship, r = -.21. According to G*Power (v 3.1.9.2; Faul et al., 2007), 236 participants are required to achieve 95% power to find this effect when \u03b1 = .05 (one-tail). The largest possible sample size will be the one that\u2019s needed to reliably replicate the smallest effect of secondary interest. This happens to be the counterintuitive relationship between GIHS and Disdain subscale of Social Vigilantism (r = .16). Since the relationship can be expected in the opposite direction (as Leary et al., 2017 did), it requires a two-tailed test; this puts us at 497 participants to obtain 95% power when \u03b1 = .05. ", "q13": "There will be two stopping rules in effect after reaching a sample of 236: one based on time constraints and the other based on the largest possible sample needed to detect the effects of secondary interest (see above). The deadline for collecting data will be the 27th of April and the largest possible sample size will be 497.

All participants will be older than 18 years old and native Turkish speakers.\n", "q10.uploader": [], "q14.question": "", "q14.uploader": [], "q15.question": "General Intellectual Humility Scale (GIHS; Leary et al., 2017): This 6-item, single factor IH measure with 5-point Likert type scale was adapted to Turkish in a previous project (G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2019). Since it showed stronger correlations (compared to LOIHS) with our variables of interest in that project, hypotheses, and the power analysis for the proposed study are based on this scale.\n\nLimitations-Owning Intellectual Humility Scale (LOIHS; Haggard et al., 2018): Like GIHS, this scale was also adapted to Turkish for G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). Although it\u2019s not the primary measure of IH for this study, it is included to replicate the IH-holistic thinking relationship in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. It uses a 9-point Likert scale and has 3 subscales with 4 items in each: Love of Learning (e.g., \u201cIf I don't understand something, I try to get clear about what exactly is confusing to me.\u201d), Appropriate Discomfort with Limitations [e.g., \u201cI tend to get defensive about my intellectual limitations and weaknesses.\u201d (reverse coded)], and Owning Limitations (e.g., \u201cWhen someone points out a mistake in my thinking, I am quick to admit that I was wrong.\u201d). \n\nAnalysis-Holism Scale (AHS; Choi et al., 2007): Although not directly related to the questions of this proposal, this scale will be included to replicate the positive relationship between IH and holistic thinking that was found in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). AHS is a measure of holistic thinking \u2014 a cultural thinking style that encompasses attention to context, expectation of constant and non-linear change, tolerance of contradictions, and a more complex understanding of causality. These principles, grounded in Chinese philosophy (Peng et al., 2006; Peng &amp; Nisbett, 1999; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2018), are measured with 4 subscales: Causality, (e.g., \u201cEverything in the world is intertwined in a causal relationship.\u201d), Attitude Toward Contradictions (e.g., \u201cIt is more desirable to take the middle ground than go to extremes.\u201d), Perception of Change [e.g., \u201cEvery phenomenon in the world moves in predictable directions.\u201d (reverse coded)] and Locus of Attention (e.g., \u201cThe whole, rather than its parts, should be considered in order to understand a phenomenon.\u201d). This scale was first adapted to Turkish and modified in Sar\u0131bay, \u015eencan, &amp; G\u00fcng\u00f6r (2018, unpublished); this version has 29 items in total and uses a 7-point Likert scale  (see https://osf.io/q8vey/ for the modifications).\n\nRight-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA; Altemeyer, 1996): RWA is a measure of attitudes towards preserving traditional values and hostility toward groups that go against them. Krumrei-Mancuso (2018) suggested that it might mediate the IH-religiosity relationship. Its Turkish adaptation (to be taken from https://www.moralintuitionslab.com/materials) contains 22 items and uses a 9-point Likert scale.\n\nDogmatism (Tolunay, 2001): This scale was a combination of original items and items taken from various other measures including Rokeach\u2019s (1960) Dogmatism scale and California F scale (Titus &amp; Hollander, 1957). It is included to replicate IH\u2019s negative correlation with Dogmatism (Haggard et al., 2018; Hoyle et al., 2016; Leary et al., 2017).\n\nSocial Vigilantism (SV; Saucier &amp; Webster, 2010): SV measures how much a person believes that their ideas are superior and must be adopted by others. Leary et al. (2017) and Haggard et al. (2018) both found null relationships between SV and IH; these results were inconsistent with the predictions of the former, but confirmed those of the latter (see Whitcomb et al., 2017 for a discussion of why IH should be unrelated to the estimation of intellectual strengths). G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) similarly found a null result, but also conducted confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses to show that it might be more productive to divide SV into 3 subscales: Responsibility for Educating Others (e.g., \u201cI feel a social obligation to voice my opinion.\u201d), Imposing One\u2019s Ideas (e.g., \u201cIf everyone saw things the way that I do, the world would be a better place.\u201d), and Disdain toward the Ignorant (e.g., \u201cThere are a lot of ignorant people in society.\u201d) (see Table 2 in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2019 for the full list). It is included in this study to replicate the positive GIHS-Disdain relationship in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019). \n\nSelf-Deception subscale of Social Desirability Scale (SD; Ak\u0131n, 2010): This 13-item subscale is similar to the one in Paulhus\u2019 (1988) Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding. It measures overconfidence in one\u2019s decisions and reasoning. SD will be included because it was a covariate in the model in G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al. (2019) that we want to replicate (i.e., IH-AHS relationship).\n\nThe attention check question (\"I have never ridden in a car.\") will be presented with the social desirability items.\n\nCognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005): CRT measures the tendency to engage in reflective thinking versus intuitive thinking. It is composed of 3 questions with \u201cbaits\u201d that immediately jump to mind; participants have to resist this intuitive answer to eventually find the correct one (e.g. \u201cIf it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?\u201d, the intuitive and wrong answer is 100 and the reflective and correct answer is 5). It is included for its relevance to the reasoning task in the second upcoming study.\n\nBeliefs about the conclusions in the syllogism task: Participants will answer the question \u201cHow much do you believe in or agree with this statement?\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10 for the sentences that they will see in the reasoning task that will be used in the second study. \n\nAbbreviated Specific Intellectual Humility Scale (Hoyle, Davisson, Diebels, &amp; Leary, 2016). Hoyle and colleagues\u2019 (2016) 5-point abbreviated version of this scale consists of 3 items: \u201cMy views about _______ today may someday turn out to be wrong.\u201d, \u201cWhen it comes to my views about _______ I may be overlooking evidence.\u201d, \u201cMy views about _______ may change with additional evidence or information.\u201d This scale will be adapted to Turkish for this project. Participants will be instructed to fill out these scales for the topics based on their responses in the previous page (believability ratings).\n\nPolitical orientation and political identity centrality: In addition to the one-item political orientation question, participants will complete social and economic conservatism measures from Y\u0131lmaz &amp; Sar\u0131bay (2016). Participants will also be asked to choose a category that best defines their ideology (conservative, social democrat, nationalist, etc.) and then to answer \"How important is it for you to define yourself with this category?\" This question will be used as a proxy for political identity centrality.\n\nReligiosity: Participants will answer the question: \u201cDo you consider yourself to be a religious person?\u201d (on a 0-100 scale).\n\nDemographics: Participants will be asked several demographic questions such as their gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) during childhood, hometown size. ", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "To test the asymmetry hypotheses regarding ideology, one-tailed Pearson\u2019s correlations will be used. To test the GIHS - Disdain (Social Vigilantism) relationship, two-tailed Pearson\u2019s correlation will be used since the effect could be expected to go the opposite of what we found in the previous project.\n\nFor the moderated asymmetry hypothesis, I will build separate regression models with ideology variables (self-placement, social conservatism, RWA) as DVs. The covariates for the models will be IH, political identity centrality, and the interaction of the two. If the interaction is significant, it will be followed up by a simple slope analysis to look at the IH-ideology relationship at different levels of political identity centrality.\n\nFor the rigidity-of-the-extreme hypothesis, I will use the two lines test (Simonsohn, 2018), with ideology as the predictor and IH as the outcome.

Many democratic governments have in recent decades implemented programmes of \u2018service learning\u2019 that aim to increase the level of civic engagement amongst young people. The evidence on the causal relationship between service learning and political participation can be improved in three respects. First, the studies that have tried to identify causal effects have suffered from small sample sizes and weak identification strategies (Burth 2016, p.61). Study 1 in this thesis addresses this gap in the literature with a large-N study that uses a matched difference-in-differences design to test the effects of participation in a service learning experience (the National Citizen Service) on future political participation and political self-efficacy. Second, there is a lack of studies that attempt to systematically describe how a service learning experience might affect an individual\u2019s political participation (Ayala 2000, p.100; DSDL 2019). Study 2 addresses this second gap by developing our understanding of the causal mechanisms that link a service learning experience to an individual\u2019s future political participation, as well as the factors that moderate this effect, through interviews with past participants of NCS.\n\nThird, there is a large amount of evidence to suggest that \u2018Get Out the Vote\u2019 (GOTV) campaigns can increase voter turnout, and to tell us what form and content a message should take to be most effective in this context (Arceneaux 2007; Gerber &amp; Green 2000; Green &amp; Gerber 2019; Nickerson 2006; Nickerson 2007). There is less evidence, however, on the effects of such campaigns on non-electoral political participation, and none at all when the target population is young people who have participated in national voluntary service. This is an important final gap in the literature. Both non-electoral participation and programmes of national voluntary service are on the rise, and non-electoral participation makes an important contribution to a strong democracy (Han 2016, p. 296). Programmes such as the National Citizen Service (NCS) are uniquely placed to encourage democratic participation post-service, but there is no direct evidence to suggest how this could be done most effectively. This study addresses this final gap, using a large (N=227,372) three-arm randomised controlled trial to test the effects of three different email messages on young people\u2019s participation in a political letter writing competition.", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "", "date_created": "2020-04-08T12:54:29.813398", "date_modified": "2020-04-08T12:49:31.697479", "registration": true, "preprint": false, "fork": false, "collection": false, "tags": [], "access_requests_enabled": false, "node_license": {"copyright_holders": ["Patrick Taylor"], "year": "2020"}, "analytics_key": "b7ae23be5dc46cedfba51095536f443d3de9f7757f0876745737ace587f0d902f6b6c181f41709ea356e2cab17ae98e06f31640d42d376a761fc6c5721e25d44c19b47442357ddec496668969ff990a229a3864c26689409d04c4429f5adcce2d31c36a67b86175308ed3f13a8441b8403ba18e6c09f4998e7ffedfcbf3712fb48536ed03fbe511f05974efca416761b", "current_user_can_comment": false, "current_user_permissions": ["read"], "current_user_is_contributor": false, "current_user_is_contributor_or_group_member": false, "wiki_enabled": true, "public": true, "article_doi": null, "pending_embargo_approval": false, "pending_embargo_termination_approval": false, "embargoed": false, "pending_registration_approval": false, "archiving": false, "pending_withdrawal": false, "withdrawn": false, "date_registered": "2020-04-08T12:54:29.793792", "date_withdrawn": null, "embargo_end_date": null, "withdrawal_justification": null, "registration_supplement": "OSF Preregistration", "registered_meta": {"q1": {"extra": [], "value": "Patrick Taylor"}, "q2": {"extra": [], "value": "When it comes to civic participation, self-efficacy and identity are particularly important factors for young people who have taken part in service learning.\n\n\u2022\tH1: Intervention 1 (self-efficacy) will be more effective than intervention 3 (no motivational message) in encouraging participation.\n\u2022\tH2: Intervention 2 (identity) will be more effective than intervention 3 (no motivational message) in encouraging participation.\n\nWhile there is evidence to suggest that both interventions 1 and 2 will be more effective than no motivational message at all (intervention 3), the literature reveals complexities in the relationship between service learning, self-efficacy and political participation.
