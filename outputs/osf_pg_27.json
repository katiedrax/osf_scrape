review protocol", "description": "BACKGROUND. Pelvic floor dysfunction is a term used to describe a variety of symptoms, signs and conditions involving different impairments on the pelvic floor muscles. \nThe existing literature suggests that sport has many health benefits. However, some of these lead to a higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. No study and review have been conducted to map the entire phenomena in the sport population.\nThe objective of this scoping review is to summarize the literature to identify the available evidence of pelvic floor dysfunction among male and female athletes. \nINCLUSION CRITERIA. Any female and male athletes of any age with pelvic floor dysfunction. Any sports, performance level and dysfunctions will be included. Any context will be considered for inclusion. \nMETHODS. This scoping review will be performed in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Scopus, CINHAL, Embase and PEDro database will be searched from inception to March 2020. Additional records will be identified through searching in grey literature and the reference lists of all relevant studies. No study design, publication type, data and language restrictions will be applied. \nTwo reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full-text studies for inclusion. A data collection form will be developed by the research team to extract the characteristics of the studies included. A tabular and accompanying narrative summary of the information will be provided.\nCONCLUSIONS. This will be the first scoping review to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. The results will add meaningful information for clinicians especially during the patient\u2019s assessment. Furthermore, any knowledge gaps of the topic will be identified. The results of this research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at relevant (inter)national scientific events.\n", "category": "project", "custom_citation": "",
