van Rooij, Anna Lichtwarck-Aschoff, isabel granic"}, "q3": {"extra": [], "value": "Youth psychological wellbeing has seen a decrease, with many adolescents reporting feelings of stress, anxiety and even depression (Pirani, October 2017). At the same time, social media have been booming with popularity, especially among youth, receiving a lot of both lay and academic attention. Seeing as these two trends co-occur, some suggest that social media use might in fact be responsible for the decrease in psychological wellbeing among youth (Twenge, Joiner, Rogers, &amp; Martin, 2018).\n\nAlthough a considerable amount of studies seems to suggest a relationship between social media use and decreased psychological wellbeing, findings remain divergent and the body of work is far from conclusive. Additionally, a recent review of research methodologies in this field shows that most studies on the effect of social media use implement retrospective questionnaires (Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted). This method has been shown, however, to poorly reflect actual use (Boase &amp; Ling, 2013; Ellis, Davidson, Shaw, &amp; Geyer, 2019), making it much harder to determine what is a reliable effect and what is not when it comes to social media use and psychological wellbeing.\n\nInterestingly, youth themselves often report using social media to reduce stress, and feel that this is effective (Rus &amp; Tiemensma, 2017). Indeed, possible mechanisms through which social media may reduce stress are the increased opportunities for social connection and support they afford. These are factors that have previously been shown to serve as way of coping with stress (Faleel, Tam, Lee, Har, &amp; Foo, 2012) and play a large role in maintaining good health (Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985; Umberson &amp; Montez, 2010). \n\nSo, the reasons why youth engage in social media might thus play a large role in the potential effects that this use subsequently has on momentary wellbeing. Unfortunately, the contexts and motivations, as well as type of social media use (e.g., active use vs. passive use), have so far received very little attention in the field (see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted), even though it is becoming increasingly clear that it is important to take these factors into account when investigating the relationship between momentary wellbeing and social media use.\n\nAdditionally, the literature so far has focused primarily on how social media use relates to psychological wellbeing. The underlying assumption seems to be that a causal relationship exists between the two, even though the field is not in a position to support this claim (again, see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted). Very little attention, however, has been paid to the possibility of stress and decreases in wellbeing (which are things youth are experiencing a lot) causing (certain) social media behaviours, rather than only the other way around, even though youth have indicated that in fact too happens.\n\nOur study aims to shed light on whether or not social media use plays a role in regulating stress, induced by a social stressor, and on the effects that social media use might have on subsequent wellbeing (i.e., regulating that stress). \n\nWe use a novel paradigm in which not only objective social media use is measured, but also context, social ties, and motivations are taken into account. The study design involved two groups of participants. Those in the Stress condition were unexpectedly asked to give a presentation, while those in the Control condition performed a neutral rating task. Following the manipulation phase, all participants were left alone in a room for 10 minutes, during which they were recorded with an overhead camera. The expectation was that the vast majority of participants would spend these 10 minutes on their smartphone. The video recording, if participants consented, was then used in a structured interview in which the participants\u2019 (smartphone) activity specifics, motivations and feelings were discussed and mapped out on a chart. Heart rate was continuously measured, in addition to mood, self-value and subjective physiological arousal, which were measured pre-stressor, post-stressor and post-monitoring. For more details about the development and implementation of this study, see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, 2020."}, "q4": {"extra": [], "value": "RQ0.  Did our stress and momentary wellbeing manipulation work?\n\nWe expect that our manipulation has indeed worked, and thus that participants in the Stress condition on average have a higher heart rate and PAQ rating during the manipulation phase than participants in the Control condition. \n\nWe also expect to find that participants in the Stress condition on average will have a lower mood and self-value rating following the manipulation phase than participants in the Control condition.\n\n- - - - -\n\nRQ1.  Does experiencing social stress influence subsequent social media use in\tyoung adults? \n\na.  Amount of social media use\n\nEarlier work has shown that youth report not only wanting to use social media when stressed, but also that they feel it works in regulating stress (Rus &amp; Tiemensma, 2017). Research is limited on this matter, and empirical evidence is scarce. While it is thus likely that youth do use social media after having experienced a stressor, we do not expect social stress to influence the time spent on social media during the 10-minute monitoring phase. \n\nSocial media use is a widespread behaviour among the vast majority of young people, and it is thus likely that a ceiling effect will manifest in the short period of time that we measure objective behaviour. \n\nAdditionally, and more importantly, based on earlier work we have increasing reason to believe that quantity is not a meaningful metric when it comes to defining effects. After all, the same amount of time can be spent in many different ways, even on social media. One person may spend 5 minutes only looking at other people\u2019s posts, whereas another may spend those 5 minutes in the same social medium on sharing relationship advice with peers, thus engaging in meaningful social interactions, and providing and receiving social support. \n\n--\n\nb.  Quality of social media use\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether stress would lead to qualitatively different social media use, and if so, what shape such a difference would take on, since research investigating the effects of specific types of social media use on wellbeing is still nascent. \n\nSome social media use research has suggested that active use of social media (i.e., posting, commenting, liking) is related to higher levels of wellbeing, whereas passive use (i.e., only scrolling, reading and looking) is related to lower levels of wellbeing (Verduyn, Ybarra, R\u00e9sibois, Jonides, &amp; Kross, 2017; Thorisdottir, Sigurvinsdottir, Asgeirsdottir, Allegrante, &amp; Sigfusdottir, 2019). One might thus expect that stress would lead one to engage more in active social media use, in an attempt to bring wellbeing back up (which would also be consistent with a tend-and-befriend response to stress, see Taylor, 2000). \n\nHowever, decreased interaction with the outside world on social media might also be expected following stress, since earlier work has shown that some people withdraw, rather than engage, in the face of stress (i.e., a withdrawal response to stress, e.g., see King &amp; DeLongis, 2014). \n\nThus, if stress leads to qualitative differences in social media use, this difference could arguably go either way, and may depend on personal characteristics (which we might explore in exploratory analyses). \n\n- - - - -\n\nRQ2.  Regulation of momentary wellbeing through social media use:\n\na.  Does post-social stress social media use work to regulate momentary wellbeing in young adults?\n\nSimilarly as with our hypothesis for research question 1.a., we expect to find no difference in momentary wellbeing regulation based on amount of time spent on social media within our 10-minute monitoring phase. Earlier literature in the field of social media and wellbeing has suggested that time alone does not relate to changes in wellbeing, and that in fact focus should be aimed at what is done, in what contexts, and why (reference).\n\n--\n\nb.  Is momentary wellbeing regulation more or less effective depending on social media use specifics in young adults? \n\nI. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of active (as opposed to passive) social media behaviours? \n\nBased on earlier research (Verduyn, Ybarra, R\u00e9sibois, Jonides, &amp; Kross, 2017; Thorisdottir, Sigurvinsdottir, Asgeirsdottir, Allegrante, &amp; Sigfusdottir, 2019) one might suspect that active use is more effective in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing than passive use.\n\nHowever, the time window in which we measure is very small (only 10 minutes), and passively engaging in an activity to distract from any stress that was just experienced might be equally effective in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing. One might expect that the proportion of active social media behaviours will moderate the relationship between amount of social media use and momentary wellbeing recovery over longer time periods, but not at short time spans. Therefore, it is also possible that no differences between active and passive social media behaviours\u2019 effects will be found in this study.\n\n\nII. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of social media behaviours related to close social ties (as opposed to distant social ties)?\n\nStress regulation is likely more effective when in these social media one encounters information by familiar, good relations, for instance because one is reminded of one\u2019s close ones, one\u2019s social network, which has been shown to be a good buffer for coping with stress in life (Ozbay, Johnson, Dimoulas, Morgan, Charney, &amp; Southwick, 2007).\n\nRQ2b II H: One might expect that the proportion of close-tie social media behaviours will moderate the relationship between amount of social media use and momentary wellbeing recovery such that recovery is greater when the proportion of close-tie behaviours is higher.\n\n\nIII. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of social media behaviours that was goal-directed (as opposed to initiated out of boredom or habit)?\n\nIn a general sense, goals have for a long time been related to positive psychological functioning (Brunstein, 1993; Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1999). In a similar vein, studies have found that people enjoy doing that which helps them meet a goal (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1999). \n\nGiven, then, that participants in our study have denoted certain activities to have been goal-directed, one might argue that those activities are indeed to some degree enjoyable to them, and thus may positively impact their momentary wellbeing. \n\nThus, stress and momentary wellbeing regulation through social media use might be more effective when those social media behaviours have been goal-directed, rather than when they were initiated out of boredom or habit. \n\nHowever, it could also be expected that activities initiated out of boredom or out of habit contribute to regulating stress and momentary wellbeing, because they might \u2018mask\u2019 what is in reality a need for distraction, which has been shown to also work as a coping mechanism for stress (e.g., see Janson &amp; Rohleder, 2017)\n\nHow self-reported motivations for social media activities relate to their effectiveness in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing thus remains an open research question.\n"}, "q5": {"extra": [], "value": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials."}, "q6": {"extra": [], "value": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."]}, "q7": {"extra": [], "value": ""}, "q8": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "The study is a between-subjects study with two conditions, Control and Stress. See the file 'Study Design' for a schematic overview of the study design. \n\nUpon coming into the bar lab \u2013 which was chosen for its informal and inviting atmosphere \u2013 participants were asked to read the study information letter, and read and sign an informed consent form. ECG Measurement equipment (BITalino (r)Evolution Plugged) (Batista, da Silva, Fred, Moreira, Reis, Ferreira, 2019) was applied to the participants\u2019 chest in accordance with the Einthoven triangle placement. Subsequently, participants were asked to turn their phones off and on, supposedly to perform BITalino calibration checks. In reality, this was done to 1) check whether the participant had their phone at hand, and 2) to nudge people to have their phone close by for the monitoring phase. \n\nAfter the physiological equipment was set up, the participants were asked fill out Dutch (or in a couple of cases, English) versions of a number of psychometric questionnaires: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale \u2013 21 items (DASS-21) (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1993), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Short (CERQ-short) (Garnefski &amp; Kraaij, 2006), the State-Trait Anxiety Index \u2013 Trait part (STAI-T) (Spielberger, Gorssuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011), and the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire for Adults (A-RSQ) (Berenson, Gyurak, Downey, Ayduk, Mogg, Bradley, &amp; Pine, 2013). Following these questionnaires, the participants were asked to fill out a baseline measurement of their mood and how they felt about themselves in that moment on a 5-point scale. This scale was indicated by smileys, ranging from a very negative smiley to a very positive smiley. Finally, the baseline measurement also included the Physiological Arousal Questionnaire (PAQ) (Dieleman, van der Ende, Verhulst, &amp; Huizink, 2010). \n\nNext, if participants were assigned to the Control condition, they were asked to perform a neutral task, not expected to elicit much of an emotional, let alone stress response. This neutral task consisted of rating two 5-minute presentation videos using a check list provided by the tester. If participants were assigned to the Stress condition, on the other hand, they had to perform the Leiden Public Speaking Task (Westenberg, Bokhorst, Miers, Sumter, Kallen, van Pelt, &amp; Bl\u00f6te, 2009), instead of rating others\u2019 presentations. The Leiden Public Speaking Task entails that participants are asked to shortly prepare and perform a presentation in front of a pre-recorded audience (of which they are aware), which has shown to elicit a moderate stress response in adolescents.\n\nFollowing the neutral/stress task, a post-stress measurement of mood, self-value and PAQ was administered, in addition to which participants were asked to fill out a number of questions regarding their cognitive appraisals of the task just performed (Mendes, Gray, Mendoza-Denton, Major, &amp; Epel, 2007). Participants were then asked to wait in the room for 10 minutes while the tester went to \u201chelp a colleague tester set up another participant\u201d. In reality, the tester then quickly went to the control room, where an overhead video camera was switched on to record participants\u2019 activities in the room during the 10-minute monitoring phase. After the 10 minutes had passed, the recording was quickly uploaded to a secure server so that it might be accessed later for the interview from within the bar lab room.\n\nUpon the researcher\u2019s return, participants asked to fill out a post-monitoring batch of the mood, self-value, and PAQ questions, as well as a number of questions regarding their sense of autonomy during the waiting period. Next, participants were partially debriefed and told that the true aim of the study is to gain insight into how youth spend their spare time. The physiological recording was stopped here, and the electrodes were removed. Participants were told that the tester would like to spend the remainder of the study time on an interview with the participant discussing these past 10 minutes, and that a video recording had been made to aid the participant in their recollection. If at this point the participant provided second consent the \u2018stimulated recall\u2019 interview took place, during which the participants\u2019 activities, motivations, and feelings were mapped on a \u2018stimulated recall chart\u2019. Upon finishing the interview, the participant was asked to fill out a debrief questionnaire and fully debriefed. They then received compensation, either in the form of a VVV gift card or study participation credits. If the participant did not consent to conducting the interview with the aid of the video recording, the interview did not take place, and the participant was debriefed, and given a reward corresponding to the time spent in the study.\n\nThis study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud University Nijmegen (approval no.

Only the variables that are relevant to the research questions in this preregistration will be discussed here.\n\nBefore we address the operationalisation and description of these variables, however, we would like to define what we understand as \u2018social media\u2019 in this study. A platform was considered a \u2018social medium\u2019 in our study when it allowed for sharing of information with a large public among who could be celebrities and strangers (i.e., not only people personally known to the user), and when information of these people was also accessible for the user. As such, the following platforms are considered \u2018social media\u2019 in our study: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr, TikTok, Periscope, Twitch, and Twitter. At the time of preregistration, digitisation of the data is still taking place, thus more platforms might emerge that have not been mentioned here but nonetheless fit this description and will thus be considered social media. Important to note is that apps that operate solely as messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, are not considered to be social media in this study due to not fulfilling the aforementioned requirements. \n\n- - - - - \n\n\u2022  (RQ1a, RQ2a) Number of seconds spent on social media. \n\nThis variable will be computed by taking together the durations of every social media instance during the 10-minute monitoring period.

Scrolling/watching and looking up someone else\u2019s profile, on the other hand, are considered to be passive social media activities. \n\nNote that activities are different to instances in that a social media instance (e.g., taking 20 seconds) can contain multiple activities (such as scrolling/watching and liking). In the attached figure, \u201cFilled Out Stimulated Recall Chart\u201d, the activities associated with each social media instance are found in the third row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cScr/K\u201d (\u201cscrollen/kijken\u201d \u2013 scrolling/looking/reading), \u201cL\u201d (liking), \u201cP\u201d (posting), \u201cC\u201d (commenting, not present in this example), \u201cZk\u201d (\u201czoeken\u201d \u2013 looking someone up, not present in this example), and \u201cPb\u201d (\u201cpersoonlijk bericht\u201d \u2013 personal message, not present in this example) in the left-most (and usually slightly larger) box within a cluster of boxes. \n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ1b, RQ2b) Proportion of close-tie social media activities out of total number of social media activities. \n\nThis variable will be computed by dividing the amount of \u2018close tie\u2019 social media activities by the total number of social media activities. \n\nIn our study, every social media activity has been given one or more identifiers on the interview chart, denoting what kind of social tie was involved in this activity. There were six possible identifiers: family, friends, romantic partner, acquaintances, celebrities or strangers. \n\nAn activity is only considered a \u2018close tie\u2019 activity when the activity is linked to friends, family, or a romantic partner. Activities related to acquaintances, celebrities, or strangers are categorised as \u2018distant tie\u2019 activities. \n\nIn the attached figure, Figure 1 \u201cFilled out interview chart\u201d, the social ties linked to each social media activity are found likewise in the third row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cP\u201d (pages), \u201cVr\u201d (\u201cvrienden\u201d \u2013 friends), \u201cFa\u201d (family), \u201cO\u201d (\u201conbekenden\u201d \u2013 strangers), \u201cRP\u201d (romantic partner, not present in this example), and \u201cK\u201d (\u201ckennis\u201d \u2013 acquaintance) in the right-most (and usually slightly smaller) boxes within a cluster of boxes.\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ1b, RQ2b) Proportion of goal-directed social media instances out of total number of social media instances.\n\nThis variable will be computed by dividing the amount of social media instances said to be initiated with a goal in mind by the total number of social media instances.\n\nDuring this study\u2019s interview, participants have been asked to indicate for each activity instance (whether it be a social media instance or something else, such as browsing or eating) why they initiated this instance. This motivation was subsequently categorised, in consultation with the participant, into one of four categories: goal-directed, habitual, out of boredom, or because of a notification. \n\nIn the attached figure, \u201cFilled Out Stimulated Recall Chart\u201d, the motivations associated with each social media instance are found in the second row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cV\u201d (\u201cverveling\u201d \u2013 boredom), \u201cD\u201d (\u201cdoelgericht\u201d \u2013 goal-directed), \u201cN\u201d (notification), and \u201cG\u201d (\u201cgewoonte\u201d \u2013 habit).\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of heart rate recovery.\n\nThis variable will be computed using measures of the average heart rate during the baseline, manipulation, and recovery phases.\n\nSpecifically, we will first calculate the increase from baseline to stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalized by the percentage of this heart rate increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 during the monitoring phase. This is done in order to account for participants\u2019 baseline; two participants\u2019 heart rates may have gone down the same amount (e.g., 10 bpm) during the monitoring phase, but for one participant this may mean that heart rate went back to baseline, whereas for the other this may mean a heart rate that is still higher than his baseline. By calculating the percentage of heart rate increase that is down-regulated, this measure becomes comparable across participants.\n\nThus, degree of heart rate recovery can be denoted as \n(mean HR stress phase \u2013 mean HR monitoring phase) / (mean HR stress phase \u2013 mean HR baseline phase).\n\nHowever, it is possible that this formula yields a number of misleading recovery degree/percentage values, which will then be dealt with accordingly. \nA simulation created with the most likely permutations of average heart rates for the baseline, manipulation and monitoring phases. \n\nThis interactive simulation has been made available as Shiny App: https://socialsampling.shinyapps.io/recovery_simulations/ \n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of PAQ recovery.\n\nThis variable will be calculated in the same way as the degree of heart rate recovery. Specifically, we will first calculate the increase on the Physiological Arousal Questionnaire (PAQ) score from pre-stress to immediately post-stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalised by the percentage of this heart rate increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 during the monitoring phase. \n\nThus, degree of PAQ recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress PAQ \u2013 post-monitoring PAQ) / (post-stress PAQ \u2013 pre-stress PAQ).\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of mood and self-value recovery.\n\nThese variables will be calculated in the same way as the degree of heart rate recovery and the degree of PAQ recovery. Specifically, we will first calculate the increase on the mood and self-value scores from pre-stress to immediately post-stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalised by the percentage of this mood/self-value increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 as measured directly after the monitoring phase.\n\nThus, degree of mood recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress mood \u2013 post-monitoring mood) / (post-stress mood \u2013 pre-stress mood).\n\nAnd degree of self-value recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress self-value \u2013 post-monitoring self-value) / (post-stress self-value \u2013 pre-stress self-value)."}, "uploader": {"extra": [{"data": {"name": "Filled Out Stimulated Recall Chart.png"}, "nodeId": "fcpsh", "sha256": "5d19eda66992fdb8a18c96d4b49bfb7164fa05c6ca012b0377dbb29a3bf4c24e", "viewUrl": "/project/aw3mf/files/osfstorage/5e50dcc035d22d00c15fb0b8/", "selectedFileName": "Filled Out Stimulated Recall Chart.png"}], "value": ""}}}, "q18": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "How certain indices will be computed has already been described above, under 'Measured Variables'."}, "uploader": {"extra": [], "value": ""}}}, "q19": {"value": {"question": {"extra": [], "value": "See the attached 'Analysis Plan' file for a description of our analysis plan per research question.

At the same time, social media have been booming with popularity, especially among youth, receiving a lot of both lay and academic attention. Seeing as these two trends co-occur, some suggest that social media use might in fact be responsible for the decrease in psychological wellbeing among youth (Twenge, Joiner, Rogers, &amp; Martin, 2018).\n\nAlthough a considerable amount of studies seems to suggest a relationship between social media use and decreased psychological wellbeing, findings remain divergent and the body of work is far from conclusive. Additionally, a recent review of research methodologies in this field shows that most studies on the effect of social media use implement retrospective questionnaires (Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted). This method has been shown, however, to poorly reflect actual use (Boase &amp; Ling, 2013; Ellis, Davidson, Shaw, &amp; Geyer, 2019), making it much harder to determine what is a reliable effect and what is not when it comes to social media use and psychological wellbeing.\n\nInterestingly, youth themselves often report using social media to reduce stress, and feel that this is effective (Rus &amp; Tiemensma, 2017). Indeed, possible mechanisms through which social media may reduce stress are the increased opportunities for social connection and support they afford. These are factors that have previously been shown to serve as way of coping with stress (Faleel, Tam, Lee, Har, &amp; Foo, 2012) and play a large role in maintaining good health (Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985; Umberson &amp; Montez, 2010). \n\nSo, the reasons why youth engage in social media might thus play a large role in the potential effects that this use subsequently has on momentary wellbeing. Unfortunately, the contexts and motivations, as well as type of social media use (e.g., active use vs. passive use), have so far received very little attention in the field (see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted), even though it is becoming increasingly clear that it is important to take these factors into account when investigating the relationship between momentary wellbeing and social media use.\n\nAdditionally, the literature so far has focused primarily on how social media use relates to psychological wellbeing. The underlying assumption seems to be that a causal relationship exists between the two, even though the field is not in a position to support this claim (again, see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, submitted). Very little attention, however, has been paid to the possibility of stress and decreases in wellbeing (which are things youth are experiencing a lot) causing (certain) social media behaviours, rather than only the other way around, even though youth have indicated that in fact too happens.\n\nOur study aims to shed light on whether or not social media use plays a role in regulating stress, induced by a social stressor, and on the effects that social media use might have on subsequent wellbeing (i.e., regulating that stress). \n\nWe use a novel paradigm in which not only objective social media use is measured, but also context, social ties, and motivations are taken into account. The study design involved two groups of participants. Those in the Stress condition were unexpectedly asked to give a presentation, while those in the Control condition performed a neutral rating task. Following the manipulation phase, all participants were left alone in a room for 10 minutes, during which they were recorded with an overhead camera. The expectation was that the vast majority of participants would spend these 10 minutes on their smartphone. The video recording, if participants consented, was then used in a structured interview in which the participants\u2019 (smartphone) activity specifics, motivations and feelings were discussed and mapped out on a chart. Heart rate was continuously measured, in addition to mood, self-value and subjective physiological arousal, which were measured pre-stressor, post-stressor and post-monitoring. For more details about the development and implementation of this study, see Griffioen, Van Rooij, Lichtwarck-Aschoff, &amp; Granic, 2020.", "q4": "RQ0.  Did our stress and momentary wellbeing manipulation work?\n\nWe expect that our manipulation has indeed worked, and thus that participants in the Stress condition on average have a higher heart rate and PAQ rating during the manipulation phase than participants in the Control condition. \n\nWe also expect to find that participants in the Stress condition on average will have a lower mood and self-value rating following the manipulation phase than participants in the Control condition.\n\n- - - - -\n\nRQ1.  Does experiencing social stress influence subsequent social media use in\tyoung adults? \n\na.  Amount of social media use\n\nEarlier work has shown that youth report not only wanting to use social media when stressed, but also that they feel it works in regulating stress (Rus &amp; Tiemensma, 2017). Research is limited on this matter, and empirical evidence is scarce. While it is thus likely that youth do use social media after having experienced a stressor, we do not expect social stress to influence the time spent on social media during the 10-minute monitoring phase. \n\nSocial media use is a widespread behaviour among the vast majority of young people, and it is thus likely that a ceiling effect will manifest in the short period of time that we measure objective behaviour. \n\nAdditionally, and more importantly, based on earlier work we have increasing reason to believe that quantity is not a meaningful metric when it comes to defining effects. After all, the same amount of time can be spent in many different ways, even on social media. One person may spend 5 minutes only looking at other people\u2019s posts, whereas another may spend those 5 minutes in the same social medium on sharing relationship advice with peers, thus engaging in meaningful social interactions, and providing and receiving social support. \n\n--\n\nb.  Quality of social media use\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether stress would lead to qualitatively different social media use, and if so, what shape such a difference would take on, since research investigating the effects of specific types of social media use on wellbeing is still nascent. \n\nSome social media use research has suggested that active use of social media (i.e., posting, commenting, liking) is related to higher levels of wellbeing, whereas passive use (i.e., only scrolling, reading and looking) is related to lower levels of wellbeing (Verduyn, Ybarra, R\u00e9sibois, Jonides, &amp; Kross, 2017; Thorisdottir, Sigurvinsdottir, Asgeirsdottir, Allegrante, &amp; Sigfusdottir, 2019). One might thus expect that stress would lead one to engage more in active social media use, in an attempt to bring wellbeing back up (which would also be consistent with a tend-and-befriend response to stress, see Taylor, 2000). \n\nHowever, decreased interaction with the outside world on social media might also be expected following stress, since earlier work has shown that some people withdraw, rather than engage, in the face of stress (i.e., a withdrawal response to stress, e.g., see King &amp; DeLongis, 2014). \n\nThus, if stress leads to qualitative differences in social media use, this difference could arguably go either way, and may depend on personal characteristics (which we might explore in exploratory analyses). \n\n- - - - -\n\nRQ2.  Regulation of momentary wellbeing through social media use:\n\na.  Does post-social stress social media use work to regulate momentary wellbeing in young adults?\n\nSimilarly as with our hypothesis for research question 1.a., we expect to find no difference in momentary wellbeing regulation based on amount of time spent on social media within our 10-minute monitoring phase. Earlier literature in the field of social media and wellbeing has suggested that time alone does not relate to changes in wellbeing, and that in fact focus should be aimed at what is done, in what contexts, and why (reference).\n\n--\n\nb.  Is momentary wellbeing regulation more or less effective depending on social media use specifics in young adults? \n\nI. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of active (as opposed to passive) social media behaviours? \n\nBased on earlier research (Verduyn, Ybarra, R\u00e9sibois, Jonides, &amp; Kross, 2017; Thorisdottir, Sigurvinsdottir, Asgeirsdottir, Allegrante, &amp; Sigfusdottir, 2019) one might suspect that active use is more effective in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing than passive use.\n\nHowever, the time window in which we measure is very small (only 10 minutes), and passively engaging in an activity to distract from any stress that was just experienced might be equally effective in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing. One might expect that the proportion of active social media behaviours will moderate the relationship between amount of social media use and momentary wellbeing recovery over longer time periods, but not at short time spans. Therefore, it is also possible that no differences between active and passive social media behaviours\u2019 effects will be found in this study.\n\n\nII. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of social media behaviours related to close social ties (as opposed to distant social ties)?\n\nStress regulation is likely more effective when in these social media one encounters information by familiar, good relations, for instance because one is reminded of one\u2019s close ones, one\u2019s social network, which has been shown to be a good buffer for coping with stress in life (Ozbay, Johnson, Dimoulas, Morgan, Charney, &amp; Southwick, 2007).\n\nRQ2b II H: One might expect that the proportion of close-tie social media behaviours will moderate the relationship between amount of social media use and momentary wellbeing recovery such that recovery is greater when the proportion of close-tie behaviours is higher.\n\n\nIII. Is momentary wellbeing regulation moderated by proportion of social media behaviours that was goal-directed (as opposed to initiated out of boredom or habit)?\n\nIn a general sense, goals have for a long time been related to positive psychological functioning (Brunstein, 1993; Sheldon &amp; Elliot, 1999). In a similar vein, studies have found that people enjoy doing that which helps them meet a goal (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1999). \n\nGiven, then, that participants in our study have denoted certain activities to have been goal-directed, one might argue that those activities are indeed to some degree enjoyable to them, and thus may positively impact their momentary wellbeing. \n\nThus, stress and momentary wellbeing regulation through social media use might be more effective when those social media behaviours have been goal-directed, rather than when they were initiated out of boredom or habit. \n\nHowever, it could also be expected that activities initiated out of boredom or out of habit contribute to regulating stress and momentary wellbeing, because they might \u2018mask\u2019 what is in reality a need for distraction, which has been shown to also work as a coping mechanism for stress (e.g., see Janson &amp; Rohleder, 2017)\n\nHow self-reported motivations for social media activities relate to their effectiveness in regulating stress and momentary wellbeing thus remains an open research question.\n", "q5": "Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.", "q6": ["For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned."], "q7": "", "q9": "We used simple randomization, in which 120 participants were assigned to one of two conditions; Control and Stress. The simple randomization sheet was created in Excel prior to the start of data collection, using a random number formula for each row (i.e. each participant). If the division between Control and Stress was not even, the required number of participants was re-assigned to the opposite group, so as to make the division even. \n\nNote: towards the end of data collection, 5 extra participants had been tested due to earlier scheduling in case of dropout. When dropout turned out not to occur, we decided not to cancel the extra scheduled participants. For these 5 participants, the same randomization procedure has been done as before (i.e., using a random number formula in Excel), and an attempt was made to keep the division within those 5 as even as possible. Unavoidably, there would be one participant more in one of the groups due to the uneven new sample number; 125.\n", "q10": "Registration prior to analysis of the data", "q11": "Data collection has finished, and the data have been accessed but not analysed. At the time of writing, the stimulated recall charts are being digitalised, meaning that we inevitably have had access to the data, but no analyses have been performed on the data. \n\nIt should be noted that a number of bachelor\u2019s students (who also performed the vast majority of the data collection) wrote their theses on parts of the data set also pertaining to this preregistration. These students were supervised by Marieke van Rooij, between January 2019 and December 2019. In order to ensure an as unbiased as possible preregistration, Nastasia Griffioen, the author of this preregistration was not told anything about the results that these bachelor\u2019s students reported in their theses. \n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that those data were digitized by the bachelor students themselves. In spite of training, a number of errors was detected in the digitization, which has led to us taking on master\u2019s students in September 2019 who would spend the data collection time included in their master thesis requirements not on collection, but on digitization only to ensure correct digitization. These master\u2019s students will write their theses on these data, too, but at the time of submission of this preregistration, no analyses (to our knowledge) have been done by the students.", "q13": "Our target sample size was 120, but as described earlier, we ended up testing slightly more than 120, leading to a total sample size of 125.", "q14": "The sample size was based on a combination of factors. Firstly, a number of other experimental social media use studies have adopted a similar sample size (Haferkamp, &amp; Kramer, 2011 \u2013 91 and 103; Deters &amp; Mehl, 2012 \u2013 102; Vogel, Rose, Roberts, &amp; Eckles, 2014 \u2013 128). Secondly, following the recommendation of our Faculty of Social Sciences Ethics Committee, we have conducted a priori power analyses in a software program called G*Power, for two possible effect sizes; an effect size d ranging of .2 (small) and an effect sized of .5 (medium). Being able to detect a small effect would require nearly 400 participants in each group. Being able to detect a medium effect would require 64 participants in each group. We suspect that the true effect size probably lies somewhere between 'small' and 'medium'. However, given time constraints we decided to stay close to previous studies\u2019 sample sizes.", "q15": "", "q20": "", "q21": "We will use the standard p&lt;.05 criterion for determining if the ANOVA and regression tests suggest that the results are significantly different from those that would be expected if the null hypothesis were correct.", "q22": "Data will be excluded from analyses in case the participant did not give consent for the use of video during the interview. Additionally, data will be excluded if we have reason to believe that the stimulated recall interview was not conducted (reliably), e.g. if the video recording for some reason did not permit a truly \u2018stimulated\u2019 recall of events.", "q23": "If missing data present themselves within a questionnaire (sub)scale, we will use the mean of that participant on that (sub)scale to fill those missing spaces. \n\nIf missing data present themselves in the form of an entire measurement missing, the participants for whom this is the case will be excluded from any analyses involving these measurements.

See the file 'Study Design' for a schematic overview of the study design. \n\nUpon coming into the bar lab \u2013 which was chosen for its informal and inviting atmosphere \u2013 participants were asked to read the study information letter, and read and sign an informed consent form. ECG Measurement equipment (BITalino (r)Evolution Plugged) (Batista, da Silva, Fred, Moreira, Reis, Ferreira, 2019) was applied to the participants\u2019 chest in accordance with the Einthoven triangle placement. Subsequently, participants were asked to turn their phones off and on, supposedly to perform BITalino calibration checks. In reality, this was done to 1) check whether the participant had their phone at hand, and 2) to nudge people to have their phone close by for the monitoring phase. \n\nAfter the physiological equipment was set up, the participants were asked fill out Dutch (or in a couple of cases, English) versions of a number of psychometric questionnaires: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale \u2013 21 items (DASS-21) (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1993), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Short (CERQ-short) (Garnefski &amp; Kraaij, 2006), the State-Trait Anxiety Index \u2013 Trait part (STAI-T) (Spielberger, Gorssuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (Raes, Pommier, Neff, &amp; Van Gucht, 2011), and the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire for Adults (A-RSQ) (Berenson, Gyurak, Downey, Ayduk, Mogg, Bradley, &amp; Pine, 2013). Following these questionnaires, the participants were asked to fill out a baseline measurement of their mood and how they felt about themselves in that moment on a 5-point scale. This scale was indicated by smileys, ranging from a very negative smiley to a very positive smiley. Finally, the baseline measurement also included the Physiological Arousal Questionnaire (PAQ) (Dieleman, van der Ende, Verhulst, &amp; Huizink, 2010). \n\nNext, if participants were assigned to the Control condition, they were asked to perform a neutral task, not expected to elicit much of an emotional, let alone stress response. This neutral task consisted of rating two 5-minute presentation videos using a check list provided by the tester. If participants were assigned to the Stress condition, on the other hand, they had to perform the Leiden Public Speaking Task (Westenberg, Bokhorst, Miers, Sumter, Kallen, van Pelt, &amp; Bl\u00f6te, 2009), instead of rating others\u2019 presentations. The Leiden Public Speaking Task entails that participants are asked to shortly prepare and perform a presentation in front of a pre-recorded audience (of which they are aware), which has shown to elicit a moderate stress response in adolescents.\n\nFollowing the neutral/stress task, a post-stress measurement of mood, self-value and PAQ was administered, in addition to which participants were asked to fill out a number of questions regarding their cognitive appraisals of the task just performed (Mendes, Gray, Mendoza-Denton, Major, &amp; Epel, 2007). Participants were then asked to wait in the room for 10 minutes while the tester went to \u201chelp a colleague tester set up another participant\u201d. In reality, the tester then quickly went to the control room, where an overhead video camera was switched on to record participants\u2019 activities in the room during the 10-minute monitoring phase. After the 10 minutes had passed, the recording was quickly uploaded to a secure server so that it might be accessed later for the interview from within the bar lab room.\n\nUpon the researcher\u2019s return, participants asked to fill out a post-monitoring batch of the mood, self-value, and PAQ questions, as well as a number of questions regarding their sense of autonomy during the waiting period. Next, participants were partially debriefed and told that the true aim of the study is to gain insight into how youth spend their spare time. The physiological recording was stopped here, and the electrodes were removed. Participants were told that the tester would like to spend the remainder of the study time on an interview with the participant discussing these past 10 minutes, and that a video recording had been made to aid the participant in their recollection. If at this point the participant provided second consent the \u2018stimulated recall\u2019 interview took place, during which the participants\u2019 activities, motivations, and feelings were mapped on a \u2018stimulated recall chart\u2019. Upon finishing the interview, the participant was asked to fill out a debrief questionnaire and fully debriefed. They then received compensation, either in the form of a VVV gift card or study participation credits. If the participant did not consent to conducting the interview with the aid of the video recording, the interview did not take place, and the participant was debriefed, and given a reward corresponding to the time spent in the study.\n\nThis study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud University Nijmegen (approval no. ECSW-2019-020).

If, by some chance, a non-native Dutch speaker had slipped through SONA\u2019s restrictions, we made sure that the participant was tested by Nastasia Griffioen, one of the researchers on this study, so that the interview \u2013 that then would have to be conducted in English \u2013 would remain reliable.", "q12.uploader": [], "q16.question": "(RQ1a &amp; b) Momentary wellbeing:\n\nWe manipulated momentary wellbeing (stress levels, mood and self-value) through implementation of the Leiden Public Speaking Task (Westenberg, Bokhorst, Miers, Sumter, Kallen, Van Pelt, &amp; Bl\u00f6te, 2009) in the Stress condition. We operated under the assumption that having to perform a presentation with very little preparation and believing that other participants would be rating the presentation, would not only increase stress levels but also lower one\u2019s mood and would momentarily decrease one\u2019s self-value. We included these measures to have a measure of momentary psychological wellbeing, rather than only physiological arousal. Arousal was measured objectively through continuous ECG measurement of heart rate, as well as subjectively through multiple administrations (pre-stress, post-stress, post-monitoring) of the Physiological Arousal Questionnaire (PAQ).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "Again, we would like to note that more variables have been collected than included in this preregistration. Only the variables that are relevant to the research questions in this preregistration will be discussed here.\n\nBefore we address the operationalisation and description of these variables, however, we would like to define what we understand as \u2018social media\u2019 in this study. A platform was considered a \u2018social medium\u2019 in our study when it allowed for sharing of information with a large public among who could be celebrities and strangers (i.e., not only people personally known to the user), and when information of these people was also accessible for the user. As such, the following platforms are considered \u2018social media\u2019 in our study: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr, TikTok, Periscope, Twitch, and Twitter. At the time of preregistration, digitisation of the data is still taking place, thus more platforms might emerge that have not been mentioned here but nonetheless fit this description and will thus be considered social media. Important to note is that apps that operate solely as messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, are not considered to be social media in this study due to not fulfilling the aforementioned requirements. \n\n- - - - - \n\n\u2022  (RQ1a, RQ2a) Number of seconds spent on social media. \n\nThis variable will be computed by taking together the durations of every social media instance during the 10-minute monitoring period. Every time a participant opens a social medium on their phone, this is regarded as one instance.\nIn the attached figure, \u201cFilled Out Stimulated Recall Chart\u201d, the time stamps associated with each social media instance (which is indicated in the top row of the chart) are subtracted to determine the duration of the instance. \n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ1b, RQ2b) Proportion of \u2018active\u2019 social media activities out of total number of social media activities.\n\nThis variable will be computed by dividing the amount of \u2018active\u2019 social media activities by the total number of social media activities. \n\nThe following activities exclusively will be regarded as active social media activities: posting, liking, sharing or commenting. Scrolling/watching and looking up someone else\u2019s profile, on the other hand, are considered to be passive social media activities. \n\nNote that activities are different to instances in that a social media instance (e.g., taking 20 seconds) can contain multiple activities (such as scrolling/watching and liking). In the attached figure, \u201cFilled Out Stimulated Recall Chart\u201d, the activities associated with each social media instance are found in the third row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cScr/K\u201d (\u201cscrollen/kijken\u201d \u2013 scrolling/looking/reading), \u201cL\u201d (liking), \u201cP\u201d (posting), \u201cC\u201d (commenting, not present in this example), \u201cZk\u201d (\u201czoeken\u201d \u2013 looking someone up, not present in this example), and \u201cPb\u201d (\u201cpersoonlijk bericht\u201d \u2013 personal message, not present in this example) in the left-most (and usually slightly larger) box within a cluster of boxes. \n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ1b, RQ2b) Proportion of close-tie social media activities out of total number of social media activities. \n\nThis variable will be computed by dividing the amount of \u2018close tie\u2019 social media activities by the total number of social media activities. \n\nIn our study, every social media activity has been given one or more identifiers on the interview chart, denoting what kind of social tie was involved in this activity. There were six possible identifiers: family, friends, romantic partner, acquaintances, celebrities or strangers. \n\nAn activity is only considered a \u2018close tie\u2019 activity when the activity is linked to friends, family, or a romantic partner. Activities related to acquaintances, celebrities, or strangers are categorised as \u2018distant tie\u2019 activities. \n\nIn the attached figure, Figure 1 \u201cFilled out interview chart\u201d, the social ties linked to each social media activity are found likewise in the third row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cP\u201d (pages), \u201cVr\u201d (\u201cvrienden\u201d \u2013 friends), \u201cFa\u201d (family), \u201cO\u201d (\u201conbekenden\u201d \u2013 strangers), \u201cRP\u201d (romantic partner, not present in this example), and \u201cK\u201d (\u201ckennis\u201d \u2013 acquaintance) in the right-most (and usually slightly smaller) boxes within a cluster of boxes.\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ1b, RQ2b) Proportion of goal-directed social media instances out of total number of social media instances.\n\nThis variable will be computed by dividing the amount of social media instances said to be initiated with a goal in mind by the total number of social media instances.\n\nDuring this study\u2019s interview, participants have been asked to indicate for each activity instance (whether it be a social media instance or something else, such as browsing or eating) why they initiated this instance. This motivation was subsequently categorised, in consultation with the participant, into one of four categories: goal-directed, habitual, out of boredom, or because of a notification. \n\nIn the attached figure, \u201cFilled Out Stimulated Recall Chart\u201d, the motivations associated with each social media instance are found in the second row, and are indicated with the abbreviations \u201cV\u201d (\u201cverveling\u201d \u2013 boredom), \u201cD\u201d (\u201cdoelgericht\u201d \u2013 goal-directed), \u201cN\u201d (notification), and \u201cG\u201d (\u201cgewoonte\u201d \u2013 habit).\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of heart rate recovery.\n\nThis variable will be computed using measures of the average heart rate during the baseline, manipulation, and recovery phases.\n\nSpecifically, we will first calculate the increase from baseline to stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalized by the percentage of this heart rate increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 during the monitoring phase. This is done in order to account for participants\u2019 baseline; two participants\u2019 heart rates may have gone down the same amount (e.g., 10 bpm) during the monitoring phase, but for one participant this may mean that heart rate went back to baseline, whereas for the other this may mean a heart rate that is still higher than his baseline. By calculating the percentage of heart rate increase that is down-regulated, this measure becomes comparable across participants.\n\nThus, degree of heart rate recovery can be denoted as \n(mean HR stress phase \u2013 mean HR monitoring phase) / (mean HR stress phase \u2013 mean HR baseline phase).\n\nHowever, it is possible that this formula yields a number of misleading recovery degree/percentage values, which will then be dealt with accordingly. \nA simulation created with the most likely permutations of average heart rates for the baseline, manipulation and monitoring phases. \n\nThis interactive simulation has been made available as Shiny App: https://socialsampling.shinyapps.io/recovery_simulations/ \n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of PAQ recovery.\n\nThis variable will be calculated in the same way as the degree of heart rate recovery. Specifically, we will first calculate the increase on the Physiological Arousal Questionnaire (PAQ) score from pre-stress to immediately post-stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalised by the percentage of this heart rate increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 during the monitoring phase. \n\nThus, degree of PAQ recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress PAQ \u2013 post-monitoring PAQ) / (post-stress PAQ \u2013 pre-stress PAQ).\n\n--\n\n\u2022  (RQ2a &amp; b) Degree of mood and self-value recovery.\n\nThese variables will be calculated in the same way as the degree of heart rate recovery and the degree of PAQ recovery. Specifically, we will first calculate the increase on the mood and self-value scores from pre-stress to immediately post-stress (indicating the stress response). Then, the degree of recovery is operationalised by the percentage of this mood/self-value increase that is subsequently \u2018recovered\u2019 as measured directly after the monitoring phase.\n\nThus, degree of mood recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress mood \u2013 post-monitoring mood) / (post-stress mood \u2013 pre-stress mood).\n\nAnd degree of self-value recovery can be denoted as \n(post-stress self-value \u2013 post-monitoring self-value) / (post-stress self-value \u2013 pre-stress self-value).", "q17.uploader": [{"file_id": "5e50dcc035d22d00c15fb0b8", "file_name": "Filled Out Stimulated Recall Chart.png", "file_urls": {"html": "https://osf.io/project/aw3mf/files/osfstorage/5e50dcc035d22d00c15fb0b8", "download": "https://osf.io/download/5e50dcc035d22d00c15fb0b8"}, "file_hashes": {"sha256": "5d19eda66992fdb8a18c96d4b49bfb7164fa05c6ca012b0377dbb29a3bf4c24e"}}], "q18.question": "How certain indices will be computed has already been described above, under 'Measured Variables'.", "q18.uploader": [], "q19.question": "See the attached 'Analysis Plan' file for a description of our analysis plan per research question.

Hence, one might hypothesize that if, on a certain trial, the number of points to be gained is much higher than the number of points to be lost, participants particularly attend to the (high) rewards and thus be more likely to show a Go response. Vice versa, if the number of points to be lost is much higher than the number of points to be gained, one might hypothesize that participants particularly attend to the (high) punishments and thus be more likely to show a NoGo response. To test this hypothesis, we will calculate the difference between the points to be gained and points to be lost on every trials (signed, i.e. positive numbers indicate more points to be gained, negative numbers more points to be lost).

Given the maximal N = 55, we would have 80% power to detect correlations of r bigger than .32 (one-sided test; computed with G*Power; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007).\n", "q15.uploader": [], "q16.question": "For questionnaires, we will report the mean score of all items (after reversing reversed items).", "q16.uploader": [], "q17.question": "A)\tGeneralized linear mixed-effects models on accuracy as DV \nWe will fit a generalized linear mixed effects model using the function glmer from the package lme4 in R (corresponding to a mixed-effects logistic regression). The model formula will be: \n\nglmer(response ~ requiredAction_f * cuePosition_f * instructions_f + (requiredAction_f * cuePosition_f * instructions_f |Subject), data = data, family = binomial()). \n\nWe expect:\na)\tA main effect of required action, reflecting that people perform more Go responses to Go than NoGo cues, i.e. they learn the task;\nb)\tA main effect of cue position, with more Go responses when cues are presented on the reward side than when they are presented on the punishment side, reflecting the motivational bias;\nc)\tAn interaction effect between cue position and instructions, such that the main effect of cue position will be smaller after compared to before the instructions.\n\nTo probe in which condition(s) (i.e. Go or NoGo cues, cues on the reward or the punishment side) the instructions improved performance (selectively or particularly), we will also inspect the two-way interaction between required action and instructions and the three-way interaction between required action, cue position, and instructions. \nTwo-way and three-way interactions will be followed up by using constrained models in which we restrict one of the three independent variables to only one factor level (e.g. only Go cues, only cues on the reward side, only Go cues on the reward side,\u2026).\n\nBy default, we will NOT compute the gradient and Hessian of the nonlinear optimization solution, i.e. set control = glmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE), because these are prone to false positive warnings. As optimizer, we will use \u2018bobyqa\u2019 by setting glmerControl(optimizer = c(\"bobyqa\").\n\nIf the models in glmer do not converge, we will increase the number of iterations using control = glmerControl(optCtrl = list(maxfun = 1e+9)) and try out different optimizers. \n\nIf models still do not converge, we will instead fit the same models in stan using the R package brms. We will use the same model equation, except that the corresponding link function has to be family = bernoulli(). We will use the following priors: set_prior(\"normal(0,2)\", class = \"b\") set_prior(\"cauchy(0,2)\", class = \"sd\") set_prior(\"lkj(1)\", class = \"cor\") We will start the fitting procedure with 4 chains, with 200 warm-up iterations and 1,000 post warm-up iterations per chains (4,000 samples total). Model will be considered to have converged when the scale reduction factor is Rhat smaller than 1.1 for all parameters (Gelman &amp; Rubin, 1992). In case model convergence was not reached, we will first increase adapt_delta up to .99, and if necessary also increase warm-up and sampling iterations will be increased up to 10,000. If models have not reached convergence until this point, we will repeat the fitting procedure while excluding subjects for whom Rhat bigger than 1.1, and report whether our results/ conclusions change after subject exclusion. We will report the percentage of samples of the respective posterior that is above or below zero. If 97.5% of a posterior (corresponding to a two-sided test) are above or below zero, we will consider this significant. \n\nIf also this approach fails, we will adapt a two-stage least-squares approach: For each subject separately, we will fit the following logistic regression using the function glm in R: \nglm(response ~ requiredAction_f * cuePosition_f * instructions_f, data = data, family = binomial()) We will then extract all regression weights of each subject and perform one-sample t-tests to test whether those weights are significantly different from zero on a sample level. \n\nB)\tLinear mixed-effects models on RTs as DV:\nAll specifications under A) apply, with the following exceptions: \na)\tInstead of the glmer() command, we will use the lmer() command \nb)\tWe will drop the binomial link function (no \"family = binomial()\"). \nc)\tSimilarly, instead of glm(), we will use lm() if applicable.", "q17.uploader": []}, "subjects": [[{"id": "584240da54be81056cecac48",
